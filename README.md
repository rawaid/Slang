# Slang
Slang is a research project aiming to find the similarities of popular rappers based on their slang usage. 
Top rappers are scraped from Last.FM, and ten all of those rappers most popular songs are also scraped. Afterwards, lyrics off all of these songs will be put into a dictionary after being parsed, lowercased, and having all garbage characters removed. 
Using a dictionary of slang terms, I will search through all the lyrics for all the rappers and accumulate slang term usage throughout all of their songs. 
After slang numbers have been calculated, I will be able to cluster artist similarity based on slang, slang and general vocabulary usage, and just the rapper's vocabulary usage.
