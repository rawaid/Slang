intro
mic check 1 2 this is dedicated to an old friend of mine michelleshe a holy roller now turned over a new leaf now everythin old gon burn

chorus
ms holy roller new angel got ya bible out shoutin and youre ringing a bell
mid-life reborn cant wait to tell if i dont believe what you believe
im going to hell

ive been down with jesus since sunday school &amp; easter speeches
the bible was survival thats what my grandma would teach us
since i was 5 ive been dying and trying to read it when i did i did it redefined it
now you was 34 when you found jesus after your life fell to pieces
wife two times with two guys now enlightened in speeches
seemed to flow out your mouth with the hype of a preacher
took your whole life to reach you now im a trifling creature

chorus

come on if i die right this second i reckon that god would simply check
into my life &amp; times dissecting my rhymes hell see how ive been leading his troops
you cant do dirt your whole life then say oops

bridge
now where was jesus when you life then you was cheatin when you was deceiving me
where was jesus when you greedy your lawyers was bleeding me
where was jesus when every weekend a new man living with you
oh wait he was with me trying to keep me from killing you
now where was jesus when you was lying &amp; you was betraying me
when i was trying to make it you was hatin delayin me huh
where was jesus when the ice was thrilling you
oh he was he with me trying to keep me from killing you

if i aint know jesus aint no telling where i would be
its been nights i felt like feces; i needed to fight to release it
im in the limelight its hot &amp; the heat is ceaseless
holding my tongue while little bums cut me to pieces
the only reasons cause i studied the life of jesus &amp;
venting with my pen intending to write &amp; release it
but when an ex-friend would slight me or slam me with venom
i hate it i cant stand it damnit i really resent it
i always strive to be righteous my version of god
the reason why i never write verses with curses inside
the reason i never purposely hurt persons
ive applied many teaching of god
searching the reaches of god
pondered the mysteries of why you be dissing me
i adore you all i hope for you is freedom from misery
you made mistakes &amp; blunders you breaking from under
but yo if im going to hell its making me wonder

bridge

the greatest atrocities ever committed on this planet have been in the
name of god
this country was founded by puritans for the expressed purpose of
oppression-free worship
your attitude is the same arrogant fearful fundamentalism that fueled the
hatred of the crusades
&amp; the attacks on 9/11
if we are not allowed to worship god as groups &amp; individuals free from
persecution in respectful
tolerance theres only one outcome
