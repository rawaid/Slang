intro - why why why why why why

chorus

i really wish i could explain it baby why
its just the world is kinda crazy baby why
aint no pretty way to paint it baby why
dont cry dry your eyes
september 11th i woke up about 7am west coast time french toast and my
turkey bacon taking my time awakin turning my tv on
to my surprise saw what everybody in the world saw
me &amp; my children images were chillin
my son said daddy were there people in that building
a cold sweat frozen with a lump in my chest
i heard his question couldnt bring my lips to say yes to him
that night at my sons side he cried &amp; prayed
for the ones who died in the world trade
his palms to god seeds and qualms with god
he just kept on pressin me wanna know why
then one week later our bombs were dropped
we seein them on cnn they just wont stop
the infrared images of brutal attack
he said daddy now we killin em back; right right

mmmmm souls are captured
dreams are stolen hearts are broken
evil blatantly rewarded
hate surrenders love exalted


hope elated negativity is shorted
why is the bomb always getting the last word
&amp; why did her uncle have to molest her
&amp; why did all them cops have to be shootin to kill
&amp; why did all them priests have to act so ill
tell me why did james byrd jr have to be touched
tell me why did malcolm &amp; martin depart from us
tell me why did that sniper make the little boy shoot
&amp; why is human life always denied for loot
tell me why did mandela have to live in a cage
why did my brother sterling have to die at that age
tell me why did reginald denny deserve his fate
&amp; why the f*@k cant love seem to defeat hate
tell me why is it so hard for all the children to eat
why did pac &amp; biggie smalls have to fall in the street
tell me why did jam master jay have to go that way
please what am i supposed to say to my kids when they say why

chorus - 2x

verse 3
cant explain it baby life is just really crazy
i mean if its world wars or the life of a little baby
we got more stores than they got rice under buddha lazy
you live four scores &amp; still it be driving you crazy
but for me i try to see the bright side
sometimes itd be like the goodness be tryin to hide
then try to flee but it cant its deep inside
sweetie you be the light for the others make em believe in god
