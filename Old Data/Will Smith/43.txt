from a distance you can witness the glow from my entourage
gravitate towards the ambiance
see me &amp; my men on cnn then the birth of the inevitable hate begin
cause hate is the chld to greatness
the glue between neo &amp; the smiths in the matrix yin to the yang
it just must be ask anybody with a grammy or an mvp

b section
i said stop get out i dont need this hate around me
all your negativity might drown me i just try to go hard doing my job
stop get out - the whole world loves me cause i do what i do
&amp; i dont like the energy coming from you trying to play me soft wave em off

chorus

i just wave em off yeah i aint concerned with your hatin that dont slow down my paper makin
wave em off yeah while the whole world recognize you looking at me with your crooked eyes
wave em off yeah love me i paved the way boys we cant behave this way come on
wave em off yeahwhile the whole world recognize you looking at me with your crooked eyes
coming of age i invaded nations on stage i seen haitian &amp; asian faces
no vacations just more locations i go places so chasing my vocation
so demonstrating the way to be patient with lifes test through my irs situations
my guess is my dedication dont phase ya a public sensation in private you hatin
why thats so last year thats so not sexy but i shall not let the hate stress me
i got bigger fish to fry &amp; i could stand on my wallet probably kiss the sky
when i close my eyes i wish that i could change how you get pissed when i do things you cant deny
truth is great do need hate to survive so i

chorus

block em out ignore em wave em off
dont pay these jokers no mind wave em off
they just all mad cause they in the coat section of the hate train &amp; they cant get off
still flaming boy stand clear of the hatin is the best defense tryin to exceed excellence
same way hope comes with fear yo
greatness lives here then hateness lives here trust

chorus
