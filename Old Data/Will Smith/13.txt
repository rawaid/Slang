another type of hustler listed at blockbuster

as long as you take me there
just cruisin
somewhere to clear my mind
just cruisin

sun settin in the s-k-y
must say ive had the best day i
tryin to find an exit
a place to chill not too hectic
so i can spend some time with will
let the sun shine to the moonlight clearin my mind
soul search see what i find
if im being the best lover and friend
am i being the best daddy i can
i pray i am
and i feel good today
reminisce as im cruisin around the way
roll tight passed the park where i used to play
cant think of a better way to spend my day
uh still findin my way
still growin
petrol lowin
moon soon showin
gots to get goin losing the light
and the freaks come out at night

just cruisin
where baby i dont care
just cruisin
as long as you take me there
just cruisin
somewhere to clear my mind
just cruisin
just cruisin
