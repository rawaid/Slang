chorus
here he comes he can rock
he can break dance and he can pop
he can rap he can act
&amp; if it comes down to it he can scrap
hey there here comes big will again

here i come yall here i come yall
watch yo back yall here i come yall
for years i been tryin to rip rhymes &amp; get mine
spit lines hot like lava this time
i dont got a sitcom to bother with
or a time conflict with my sci-fi hits
im contemplating each statements wit
&amp; im concentrating on making hits
&amp; im fittin em line by line
teeth i grit &amp; im tryin to find the perfect rhyme scheme
im dreamin about yall gleamin doubt
hes back from actin hes screaming out
how he practiced rap &amp; now hes devout
every album track packs what hes about
in the past he passed with passion old fashioned
boldly mashing totally crashing
words up in a disorderly fashion
but back to the lab &amp; guess what happened kaboom
ooh wee dudes resilient fresh prince was hot
the movies killed him wait hold up stop you can rebuild him
lock him back in hip hop while dudes not filming
shock by the film &amp; the tv money went from scenes with uncle phil
to scenes with sonny so hard to break free from a guaranteed 20
but its done so come see the mc honey 

chorus

bridge

everytime he touch the mic he closes his eyes and he hope to shine
then like a streak of light theyd show his name theyd be like aaahhh
 hey there here comes big will again 

here comes big will again
here comes big will again
