i thought you was the one hon yeah
when i met you at the freak nik
whoever thought youd be the type to greet and keep secrets
my friends said dont sleep but i did so now im reapin
da seeds that i sowed i cant believe you so deceivin
sneakin out on the weekends with michelle
one of your freak friends from the east end she bad as hell
half black and indonesian the one that taught you treason
cupid shoot me on my heart but damn whyd you leave it bleedin

i gave you no reason to lie
but you choose to live untrue
knowing how i feel inside
theres no telling what i might do
cause i gave you

chorus

all my mind
all my soul
from the very start
i gave you full control and you broke my heart
i tried to show you a better way of life
but i see that must be what you like
i loved you more than anything
i tried to build the future turn a house into a home
i wanted us to be one flesh and one bone
its so hard to keep my sanity
now i can do is sit back and reminisce
look at the pictures in the frames yo
why you playin games yo

as i think back to the begining we was together
we both loved sports long walks and autumn weather
both wanted kids and a family a strong personality
i liked the way you handled me
candles be lit mood set food set you ready yet
thats what you said while you was massagin my head
now look here i could never leave you lonely
cause the love you showed me had me feeling like you already had known me
member when you used to blindfold me till i dont see
use your mind thats what you told me
kissin me slowly
never was the loud type always on the low key
pretty style but rugged
and damn i brother i loved it

the birds of a feather sposed to fly together
guess that dont apply to birds of your kind
cause you only wanted what you wanted like a poacher
came to steal my heart and leave me to die
i aint going out like that though

chorus
