this is a true story

chorus

loretta wrote a love letter to a stranger thought that he would change her life
thought she would be his wife oh loretta
never ever meant him no danger her love for his sustained her
thought that he would change her life
miss loretta a young girl i never really met her
a fun girl a real go-getter i heard a gold jetta
a full with books &amp; herb or so im told hooked on my every word
oh so bold a love letter cleverly worded in a jacket pocket
wrapped inside a platinum locket
in the shape of a heart with pictures of me
had it inscribed no us no him then no me
she fell in love with the prince of bel-air
fantasy was to see me &amp; to be with me there
so she wrote a love letter to me &amp; then she signed it loretta
said i gotta go get him will is my soulmate
we gotta be together how could we not be together
but wait if i send the letter i mean how will i be sure if they give it to him
what if they dont give it to him that would ruin everything
i gotta take it to him myself

chorus

she packed all that she owned into the back of her jetta
her backpack her cellphone &amp; a love letter
most of her stuff was done up with pictures of me on it with a phrase its gonna be on it
her mother begging her please come home &amp; then loretta resenting her
leave me alone ma i wont leave my destiny unfulfilled
youre just jealous be cause daddy aint as sweet as my willclick
to the front gate at nbc in june &amp; july backstage at mtv
she would drive anyplace that theyd mention id be
told herself strive for love &amp; god eventually
he would give me to her &amp; her to me this was meant to be
14 months outside every event that id be at shed still keep missing me
&amp; now shes getting high with more frequency now
rage rumbling inside got to be with me now
then she heard i married jada she took her love letter out &amp; wrote down
ps - i hate her

chorus
