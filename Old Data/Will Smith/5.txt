now dad this is a very sensitive subject
from the first time the doctor placed you in my arms
i knew id meet death before id let you be harmed
although questions arose in my mind would i be man enough
against wrong choose right and be standin up
from the hospital that first night
took a hour just to get the car-seat in right
people drivin all fast got me kinda upset
got you home safe placed you in your basonette
that night i dont think one wink i slept
as i slipped out my bed to your crib i crept
touched your head gently felt my heart melt
cause i knew i loved you more than life itself
then to my knees and i begged the lord please
let me be a good daddy all he needs
love knowledge discipline too
i pledge my life to you

chorus

just the two of us we can make it if we try
just the two of us just the two of us
just the two of us building castles in the sky
just the two of us you and i

verse 2

five years old bringin comedy
everytime i look at you i think man a little me
just like me
wait an see gonna be tall
makes me laugh cause you got your dads ears an all
sometimes i wonder what you gonna be
a general a doctor maybe a mc
haha i wanna kiss you all the time
but i will test that butt when you cut outta line trudat
uh-uh-uh why you do that
i try to be a tough dad but you be makin me laugh
crazy joy when i see the eyes of my baby boy
i pledge to you i will always do
everything i can
show you how to be a man
dignity integrity honor an
i dont mind if you lose long as you came with it
an you can cry aint no shame in it
it didnt work out with me an your mom
but yo push come to shove
you was conceived in love
so if the world attacks and you slide off track
remember one fact i got your back

chorus

verse 3

its a full-time job to be a good dad
you got so much more stuff than i had
i gotta study just to keep with the changin times
101 dalmations on your cd-rom
see me-im
tryin to pretend i know
on my pc where that cd go
but yo aint nuthin promised one day ill be gone
feel the strife but trust life does go on
but just in case
its my place
to impart
one day some girls gonna break your heart
and ooh aint no pain like from the opposite sex
gonna hurt bad but dont take it out on the next son
throughout life people will make you mad
disrespect you and treat you bad
let god deal with the things they do
cause hate in your heart will consume you too
always tell the truth say your prayers
hold doors pull out chairs easy on the swears
youre living proof that dreams come true
i love you and im here for you
