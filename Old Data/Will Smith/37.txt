yo big will in the place to be mic checkmic check
would you love me in the shack in a shanty town
would you love me if my pants was hand me downs huh
yo yo
often times i hear a phrase when im out &amp; about
8 to 80 all walks of life be shouting it out
usually when its time for a encore i hear it
or when i did something hot evoking the spirit
its weird its like a double edge sword when yall applaud
its kinda wild a peace sign a smile
how do i respond to the phrase i love you will
kinda heavy when i hear it id be like damn for real
in a way it makes me wanna stay strong and moral
but history say i could be gone tomorrow
&amp; though my future looks floral
i feel like im hoping for much pain
when people stop shouting my name
&amp; doubting my game &amp; liking others better than me
writing letters to him instead of to me
a veteran b i know the game but do me this here
in your heart be clear before you bless my ear
come on

chorus

could you love me if i lived in a shanty town
could you love me if my pants was hanging down
could you love me if my wrist aint bling
if i wasnt on tv &amp; i aint sing huh
could you love me if my whip wasnt chrome fitted
would my name be easier to forget it huh
could you love me if wrist aint bling
if i wasnt on tv &amp; i aint sing huh
i pray before i sit with a pen &amp; a pad
a birth of a thought occurs &amp; it calls me dad
to the universe an idea released from me
just a cd nah man a piece of me
what you cant see is when you be dancing b
is i asked you a question thats how you answer me
so when you dont dance it be like im choking from cancer
like i wrote rancid rhymes i cant survive
sure i rationalize like oh i see
but if you dont like my cut its like you dont like me
some stuff works some works not so well
its like you work so hard still get hurt like hell
yo it could tear you apart
but dont let your wins go to your heard
your losses go to your heart
&amp; if we ever get the pleasure to meet
be clever with it measure what you yell in the street
come on

chorus

whoo would you
whoo could you
