chorus
git on the floor whoa im the party starter
you might have a good time but we party harder
so tell the dj to play my song
&amp; we could dance all night to the early mornin

oh im the party starter
you might have a good time but we party harder
so tell the dj to play my song
&amp; we could dance all night to the early mornin
dance an aphrodisiac
women gyrating simulating sensual acts
to stimulating musical tracks
i thought i was just gon come out tonight &amp; get a brew &amp; relax
but no uh uh when youre the party starter
its like youre on call youre what the doctor ordered
its like you gotta block the border to the door
&amp; shock em when its boring
git on the floor
ughh its the groovicide bomber mic in my vest
tight strapped to my chest
like ima run up in the party hollerin
&amp; be like ohhh fulfillin my callin
big big will will thats my name whoop
writin rhymes thats my game whoop
ask me again and ill tell you the same whoop
just write ya number down right next to ya name girl

chorus

he was raised in the days when the roof was raised
every rap occasion new &amp; amazing
the back of the stage amazed and gazin
prayin for the day they would one day praise him
studied the ways of the game &amp; made it
came through the maze &amp; the haze &amp; played it perfect
days any person hated &amp; cursed him he was unfazed
he waited it was worth it he never retaliated
he saved it slavin on the road blazin
days when he was low nothin could raise him
he came to the show &amp; somethin uncaged in him
like the pope but its party crusade im like braids thats never gon
fade ya heard
im like 23s on an escalade throw me into the rave
like you threw a grenade - boom

chorus 2x

i call for the days of the unadulterated
when the artistry was cultivated
you know back when rap was smart and multilayered
we could rap without a&amp;rs&amp; ultimatums damn
now today i could say i long for the days when the party was all about
partyin
i was a mini-party starter then
my mind bends when i call my pen
the big question should i run the mind a vittle
food for thought or dumb the rhyme a little
but will if you come to high thatll alienate folks &amp; they wont buy
ityo
look people getting trapped in the track
&amp; they be clappin even when the rappin is wack
yo what happened when did we get happy wit that
hes old-fashioned yup but lets be happy hes back
ya heard me

chorus 2x
