earth well messin with me is worse

when i was born there was rainbow formed
with no sun roy g biv markin a path for the chosen one
an angel my grandma told me before she died smart folks dont need to
put no cursin in their rhymes
so from cd to tv to movies back to rhymin
my life stats made jordans six rings seem common
yall hate i retalliate just by being great
big will the enemy of your mental state
with the same rhyme i used to burn your idol in a battle
to subdue you into sayin look i dont want to battle
mibw3 my respect black stealth bomba roma radar cant detect that
im comin is what i screamed as a teen armed with discipline
faith in a dream and as the smoke clears after lifes roller
coasters see who stands puttin his mike into his holster

im comin
im comin
you cant stop me
you cant stop me
im comin
im comin
you cant hold me back
im comin
im comin
you cant stop me
you cant stop me

batton down the hatches and latch the doors
you wanna to try to match my wits with yours
3 hits i hit you you hit the floor
this track is the third hit thats for sure
beat thick remenising of a bottecelli
im like a cheetah hunting out on the serengeti
i got my x-ray vision through all in my way
no plan b it disracts from plan a
stage splittin in half earthquake style
evacuate the premisis the hard core nemisis
i never miss my flow never flawed
grab mikes and send electric shock through the cord
quest for the rings my only weapons intuition
my future position determined by past decisions
so young george bush im thinkin about runnin
maybe not this time but trust dude

im comin
im comin
you cant stop me
you cant stop me
im comin
im comin
you cant hold me back
im comin
im comin
you cant stop me
