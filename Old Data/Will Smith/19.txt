verse 2

i wake up every morning in the canopy bed
slip a kiss to the miss you the man she says
mirror mirror need i call
you know uno bad breath an all
times i been fed up still didnt let up
stead a doin dirt did work and kept my head up
set up
for the future much love to my girl
north pole got my butt cold sittin on top of the world
an im feelin so high
touch the ceiling the sky
you say i smile cause im on top of the pie
but yo the cream can only finance the smile for a little while
my grin got longevity got family backin me
thats why im livin happily
ever after love and laughter
hussle cause i wants to not cause i have to
ask yourself who made the polar caps melt
fp the phenomenon true don juan jon blaze
the fonz aint seen my happy days
the track plays im in the shades singin a phrase

chorus

verse 3

they say the clothes dont make the man
take my hand
watch me freak this
ah-mommys tryin ta creep this
tryin to entice me to let it off
but nah why not cmon baby you saw set it off
proposition by trio in rio
menage trois down at the marde gras
but nah my clothes by versace
my attitude cocky the sym- its imanyaki
like a felon no tellin what i do next
i dont front cause im paid but i do flex
southwestern crib like a villa
vacation on a mountain in manilla
rhyme spilla real thrilla
an its real clear
yall talkin east and west im talkin hemispheres
my papa raised no fool
so many zeros on my check its like oooooooooooohh

chorus to fade
