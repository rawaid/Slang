yo aint no better man for this hype track
just the veteran taking the mic back
david letterman even said he like that track man
even though he aint a rap fan
black radio they wont play though
ever since summertime they aint liked none of mine
even though the fans went out &amp; bought enough
i guess they think will aint hard enough
maybe i should just have a shoot out
run up in the bank bustin grabbin all the loot out
whoop somebody ass taking my boot out
right on tv so yall can see me
just ignorant attacking actin rough
i mean then will i be black enough
oh wait maybe ill jack a truck
full of cigarettes guns &amp; drugs &amp; stuff

chorus - 2x
get back
i wish i would of made that
lean back
i wish i would of made that
i wish i woulda told the girls to drop it like its hot
summer summer summertime
seem like all i got

i always envied how yall rock wit dre &amp; the chronic
the way that tupac biggie 50 and jigga got it
a lot like ll chuck d slick &amp; dougie
i think yall love me but yall place other rappers above me
&amp; i dont know if you feel my flow
&amp; be at my show &amp; youll see where i should go
on the charts of rhyme arts &amp; thoughts in rap form
damnit i expanded the platform
damnit this cats on a rap song
yeah it aint no braids or plats on
aint on stage wit no gats on
you know im afraid getting my act on
it might have stunted my growth
but i wanted them both
&amp; i hope that it would be less tougher
you do two things &amp; then they both gonna suffer
i chose to act &amp; it broke my heart not to rap
prodigal son clever better than ever back

callin for help
with no call back where was yall at gimme the ball back
i got my swagga back
