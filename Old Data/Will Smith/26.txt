intro
original - a first form from which varieties arise
an authentic work of art as opposed to an imitation or reproduction

chorus
why should i try to sound like yall sound
thats whats wrong with the rap game right now
man its like a circus wit a bunch of clowns
wit a bunch of clicks ill probably rap circles around

verse 1
i spit heatrock and i aint talking rollin
soon as the beat knock im crowd controlling
when i hear yall that a awful sound
i dont ride beats i take them off the ground
land them somewhere show them the town
even on foreign ground i let them know im around
i dont follow everybody when its time to rap
at one time everybody thought the world was flat
sounds like you that was my intention
i paid dues now dudes pay attention
i live for it even though the flicks is hittin
cribs sick you can see the booth from the kitchen
speak on it cause i saw it happen
this is hip hop dawg
i aint just rappin
yall looking at a real mc
man you couldnt check a mic for me

chorus

why should i try to sound like yall sound
thats whats wrong wit the rap game right now
why should i try to flow the way yall flow
or do a show like yall show
naw that aint where my head at now
yall in the hip hop lost and found
man thats wrong with the rap game right now
its like a circus wit a bunch of clowns
wit a bunch of clicks
ill probably rap circles around

verse 2
lets talk about rhyme capability
lets talk about hip hop versatility
lets talk about taking the game beyond
now how the hell we gon have a battle of wits


trick you aint armed
lets talk about love for the game
i mean real love
back before there was fame
im real wit it
i aint claiming to reign
but when yall talk about rap
yall gon start saying my name
for real though i aint playin
plenty of yall love a brotha just scared to say it
yo the first ever rap grammy
lets talk about the only reason yo ass went to miami
yup truck wit rims check throw back jersey check
champagne bottles check lots of models check
damn thats the list for 90 percent of yall videos and songs
am i wrong

chorus

verse 3
lost
when you a slave to the biz
wit no care for the cost of what you sayin to kids
found
is when ya lyrics are a test of time
and your mom hear that your spirit is blessed divine
lost
is when you rhyme til your throat gets sore
but you dont even believe what you say no more
found
is when you bleed heart into the mic
and the pain you sustain it can change a life
lost
is when you hide behind the freedom of speech
while sure youre free to do it
but what it mean to do it
did you mean to do it
did you need to do it
did you take time to think about the seeds you ruined
found is esco dead prez and them
found is lauren hill
found is rakim
found can be you
if you felt the message and ask yourself this questioin
