daddy can you tell me a story

willow
a scary story
verse 1
oh ok
once upon a time there was a kid who wanted nothin more than to rhyme
almost like he was born in the rhyme
he thought of his rhymes almost all of the time
and he fought with his mom
his school getting caught with his rhyme book
and he knew he shouldnt of took it there in the first place
at least he shouldnt of been sittin lookin there in her face with it
teacher told him get it out of her class
wicked witch trick told him thats probably why you wont pass
now if you shy you wont last but youre new
so underneath his breath before he left he said im a be richer then you
what you say she said
what you mean he said
boy dont you play she said
what you mean he said damnit
ten minutes later standin up in the principles office
getting handed the phone clammed up cause his father was talking
and he was pissed he wasnt listening to his son
you testing me you messin up again
you done boy
chorus
this is just a story about a young man comin up in the rap game
a real scary story
went from rags to riches it has goblins in it haters and witches uh

repeat chorus

verse 2
first thing he did was find somebody to give him some money
he wasnt stupid but wasnt using his senses honey
the guys he meant was a little shady a little funny
but they gave him the money so they played the record company
it sounds silly but when he grew up in philly rhymin wasnt what it is today
deals wasnt a dime a dozen
today every sister uncle or mom or cousin gotta record deal
but for real it wasnt like that then
as you could imagine when he started risin to fame and fortune he was
havin started antagonizing the guys he was with
at the same time he started realizing
the deal he got from them guys in his eyes didnt fly with size of his hits
he called a meeting to find a solution
he said im gettin beat out of my loot
and im not recording no more until we find a solution
the dudes said we found a solution its this 44
he ran for the door a little shaken
but the next day he found a lawyer told him the situation
he said im breakin this contract for ya
he said how much the lawyer said im a charge you a quarter cause i like you 
just do me a favor
get your life in order

chorus
