ooh ohh
here i stand before you - brown
color of the mountains
colossal as the earth
wrapped so deliciously within my own joy and misery
feathers of my wings paralyzed by the distance of my mind
here i stand before you the color of the night
frozen by the potential of me
uh uh uh uh uh-uh-uh-uh-uh an afro angel

afro angel off your pedestal from perchin above
you on the prowl now downtown searchin for love
in all the wrong places outside your radio stations
hopin he with new hit single is tryin to mingle
today he is me in your town puttin it down
you in the car with your friends followin my limo around
puttin a bug in my boys ear your s is for free
youll do anything for omar or phil bring you to me
and then me hypnotized by the devil as well
hold out my hand as an invitation into my hotel
no need to rsvp place your hand in my palm
as all your girlfriends getting jealous  damn she landed the bomb
willing to trade your spirit for some crass whack wage
something small something simple as a pass back stage
but now i lay me down to creep
and i - pray the lord my soul to keep

chorus
afro angel born against the world
you dont have to sell your soul and throw away your pride
afro angel sent from heaven above
never forget that you are loved
you know that you are loved

lil bobby got a gun now age fifteen
destined to spend his life inside a cage it seems
rage inside pride been denied respect
he cant take it though he gotta earn it
but he aint learned that yet
out on the town reckless abandon hes been bullied before
but now he straps so no more
attitude high
flexin on every guy that walk by
but dont start pal
asif the gun came from the whiz cowardly lion got heart now
lets pull it on a stranger
ahh fun for the crew
surprised when he realized damn dude got one too
smiles upside down now games aint so cute
bobbys a deer in a headlights
pumk drop it or ill shoot
then like a sniper cleanin his rifle bobby disobeys his commands
one shot rings out gunshot then only the stranger stands
could of sworn bobbys blood formed the shape of an angels wings
but for what

chorus
afro angel born against the world
you dont have to sell your soul and throw away your pride
afro angel sent from heaven above
never forget that you are loved
you know that you are loved

back in high school tamika was the sweetest the bomb
hot to death though in tenth grade a teenage mom
knocked up by some thug named russ in the drug game
but had the cutest kid you ever seen
then off of pressure from her mom
she stepped to russ
said its either them drugs or us
either them thugs or us
the ultimatum either continue bein a thug in the world
or start lovin your girl
and say god bear me witness no doubt lovin ya dear
but to go from 50 gs a week to 30 gs a year
that aint happenin
i guess he wasnt that strong
he came back the next week and the whole family was gone
yo they straight moved away without as little as a word
well needless to say russ was a little perturbed
then in a fury put the pressure on her girlfriend shawn
and like a clumsy chef she spilled the beans on where they had gone

upstate schenectady
tamika answered the door
it was the last person she expected to be
they just stared
he said you love me for me
you can do without the cars vacations and jewelry
down with me
period
through lifes stress and strife
she said yeah he said in that case
would you please be my wife
then like a sign from the sky the baby cried
like an angel sings
i love yall more than anything

chorus
afro angel born against the world
you dont have to sell your soul and throw away your pride
afro angel sent from heaven above
never forget that you are loved
you know that you are loved

repeat chorus
