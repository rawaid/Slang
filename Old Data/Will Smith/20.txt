yo lets talk about
when i released my first single back in like 86
people was like oh you know thats popcorn and you know they weak
you know then i mess around i go world trade on them
bangin out them multi-plats they still got negativity to bring
my thing is you cant say nothing nice dont say nothing

take your place allow me to flex a taste
as my accomplishments bring up my comp like mase
face me the star of stage and tv
my face be seen in almost every country
grammy winner soon to be oscar nominee
who he thats dressed jiggy straight from west philly
thought i was wack cause i wanted to act
now every brother and his mother that rap be trying to do that
the ill kid
hundred million dollar bill kid
the one you love to chill with come on keep it real kid
dont try to act like this summer at the greek
you wont be bumpin the big willie in your jeep
i know yall still feel me 
really dont act silly
thought i feel off just becuase i left philly
took a break from the rap thing went on hiatus
i picked up the art of acting and multiplied papers
i chilled on silk sofas chatting with oprah
she asked me if its true that me and jeff broke up hell naa
while yall kids busy playing drug pimp and playa
i was at my crib in barbados chillin with jada to date her
vertex is me the magnanimous

look here yall dont say nothing then i wont

just dont say nothing dont say nothin
just dont say nothing dont say nothin

man i love being me ready to rock ya block
with some more hot top not ___ for you to cop
no more mr nice guy
my whole life ive been smiling when i felt like whiling
jealousy swinging on me made his attack
he soft he wack man that aint real rap
you believe that
it hurt me at first but its cool
took the insults fed em to my ego used it for fuel
now everywhere i turn a dead end
hundred women coming at me waving pads and pens
and they be screaming out
oh my lord

brother from id4

a picture and your signature

oh my god my girlfriends they aint gonna believe this
worldwide wait nah hold up galactic

bangkok to madagascar they wanna see me
princepe in spain japan im kota ishe
i like my steaks thick and my jets private
and my son to ride in the cockpit
i know hes only four taking lessons from the pilot
while im on my cell with my broker getting stock tips
find a magazine and i read the hottest gossip
man whod a thought my life would be such an interesting topic
well yall know how it is wait hold up yall dont
well look here yall dont say nothing than i wont

just dont say nothing dont say nothin
just dont say nothing dont say nothin

make sure my voice sounding crisp in your tweeters
im about to show you how a man like me works
my shorty get ice five carrots and nothing cheaper
four five chromed out former two seaters
fifty inch sony to watch siskel and ebert
cause im about to get two thumbs ten toes one knee and probably a couple
of elbows
cause yo im the man and the whole world knows
rock film festivals and rap shows
all the critics jealous people and back-stabbers
my so called friends who been nothing but actors

but look here yall dont say nothing then trust me i wont

just dont say nothing dont say nothin
just dont say nothing dont say nothin
just dont say nothing dont say nothin
