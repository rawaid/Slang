early mornin wake up
gently with the caress on your hand
and that kimono that i bought you on my trip to japan
sunshine peekin through the venetian blinds
four years and like wine you got fine over time
i got a question if the prada dressin and the gucci
all got ghost and the freeze on the lucci
i mean real bad girl im talking rougher than rough
do you think itd be enough if we just had us
dont answer quick think about it cause im askin for real
gold diggers goin to hear this song drivin and crash at the wheel
forever is a long time so far we gettin along fine
no car i ever drove no ice i ever saw
no music i ever made aint nothin i wanted more
we could deal with whatever together
sunshine or that other weather when we chasin forever

chorus

i wanna stay with you forever
i wanna spend all my life with only you
i wanna stay lets stay together
chasing forever with only you

verse 2

chasin forever a buck-wild endeavor it seems
are we pursuin somethin real or just chasin a dream
or casin the scene
fore i die i plan
to see us holding eternity in the palm of our hands
now as a man theres certain things im lackin for sure
but im committed to growin and coming at you mature
in the future i know it aint gonna be all good
but when we feelin the hurt if we willin to work
the eight ball will never turn to see us behind
though i aint no knight and my armor dont shine
my mom said the linchpin of love is trust
an taught me monogamy is a monoga-must
a plus for you dinner by candlelight
now dont commit before you sure you understand me right
its a race to a strange place most see never
its a chase we gotsta make together forever

chorus

verse 3

now you would think after all my heartbreaks id be cruel
hiding behind my ego evil but no
much the contrary im very much certain
you searchin for joy its on the other side of hurtin
finally found a person worthy of all
instead of pushin me down you wanna cushion my fall
your eyes could make the sun rise all the birds sing
seal it with a kiss bind it with a ring
more carats than even bugs could eat in a week
and the ribbon in the sky close your eyes dont peek
ill tell you what i see in the future
a hacienda so cute with five little kids callin you mom and callin me dad
havin more good times than jj had
judging by the look in your eyes you see it
let no man sever welcome to forever

chorus to fade
