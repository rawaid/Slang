america
background the white zone is for 
 loading and unloading of passengers only no parking
we love you 
how many people are proud to be citizens
of this beautiful country of ours
the stripes and the stars for the rights that men have died for to protect
the women and men who have broke their necks for the freedom of speech 
the united states government has sworn to uphold
or so we are told
yo i want everyone to listen to the words of this song

i never would have dreamed in a million years id see
so many motherfuckin people who feel like me
who share the same views and the same exact beliefs
its like a fuckin army marchin in back of me

so many lives ive touched so much anger aimed
at no particular direction just sprays and sprays
straight through your radio waves it plays and plays
till it stays stuck in your head for days and days

who woulda thought standin in this mirror bleachin my hair
with some peroxide reachin for a t shirt to wear
that i would catapult to the forefront of rap like this
how could i predict my words would have an impact like this

i mustve struck a chord with somebody up in the office
cause congress keeps tellin me i aint causin nothin but problems
and now they sayin im in trouble wit the government im lovin it
i shoveled shit all my life and now im dumping it on

white america i could be one of your kids
white america little eric looks just like this 
white america erica loves my shit 
i go to trl look how many hugs i get 

white america i could be one of your kids
white america little eric looks just like this 
white america erica loves my shit 
i go to trl look how many hugs i get 

look at these eyes baby blue baby just like yourself
if they were brown shady lose shady sits on the shelf
but shadys cute shady knew shadys dimples would help
make ladies swoon baby ooh baby look at myself

lets do the math if i was black i woulda sold half
i aint have to graduate from lincoln high school to know that
but i can rap so fuck school im too cool to go back
gimme the mic show me where the fuckin studios at

when i was underground no one gave a fuck i was white
no labels wanted to sign me almost gave up i was like
fuck it until i met dre the only one who looked past
gave me a chance and i lit a fire up under his ass

helped him get back to the top every fan black that i got
was probably his in exchange for every white fan that hes got
like damn we just swapped sittin back lookin at shit wow
im like my skin is it startin to work to my benefit now

its white america i could be one of your kids
white america little eric looks just like this 
white america erica loves my shit 
i go to trl look how many hugs i get 

white america i could be one of your kids
white america little eric looks just like this 
white america erica loves my shit 
i go to trl look how many hugs i get 

see the problem is i speak to suburban kids
who otherwise woulda never knew these words exist
whose moms probably woulda never gave two squirts of piss
till i created so much mutherfuckin turbulence

straight out the tube right into your livin rooms i came
and kids flipped when they knew i was produced by dre
thats all it took and they were instantly hooked right in
and they connected with me too because i looked like them

thats why they put my lyrics up under this microscope
searchin with a fine tooth comb its like this rope
waitin to choke tightenin around my throat
watchin me while i write this like i dont like yes no

all i hear is lyrics lyrics constant controversy sponsors workin 
round the clock to try to stop my concerts early surely
hip hop was never a problem in harlem only in boston
after it bothered the fathers of daughters startin to blossom

so now im catchin the flack from these activists when they raggin
actin like im the first rapper to smack a bitch and say faggot
shit just look at me like im your closest pal the poster child
the mutherfuckin spokesman now

for white america i could be one of your kids
white america little eric looks just like this 
white america erica loves my shit 
i go to trl look how many hugs i get 

white america i could be one of your kids
white america little eric looks just like this 
white america erica loves my shit 
i go to trl look how many hugs i get 

so to the parents of america
i am the derringer aimed at little erica
to attack her character
the ring leader of the circus of worthless pawns
sent to lead the march right up to the steps of congress
and piss on the lawns of the white house
to burn the casket and replace it with a parental advisory sticker
to spit liquor in the faces of this democracy of hypocrisy
fuck you ms cheney
fuck you tipper gore
fuck you with the freedom of speech this divided state
of embarrassment will allow me to have
fuck you

ha ha ha 
im just playin america you know i love you
