nate
mom i know i let you down
and though you say the days are happy
whys the power off and im fucked up

and mom i know hes not around
but dont you place the blame on me
as you pour yourself another drink

i guess we are who we are
headlights shining in the dark night i drive on
maybe we took this too far

eminem
i went in headfirst never thinking about who what i said hurt
in what verse my mom probably got it the worst the brunt of it
but as stubborn as we are did i take it too far
cleaning out my closet and all them other songs but regardless i dont hate you cause ma

youre still beautiful to me cause youre my mom
though far be it from you to be calm our house was vietnam
desert storm and both of us put together can form an atomic bomb
equivalent to chemical warfare and forever we can drag this on and on

but agree to disagree that gift for me up under the christmas tree dont mean shit to me
youre kicking me out its 15 degrees and its christmas eve little prick just leave
ma let me grab my fucking coat anything to have each others goats
why are we always at each others throats especially when dad he fucked us both

were in the same fucking boat youd think that itd make us close nope
further away that drove us but together headlights shine and car full of belongings
still got a ways to go back to grandmas house its straight up the road
and i was the man of the house the oldest so my shoulders carried the weight of the load

then nate got taken away by the state at 8 years old and
thats when i realized you were sick and it wasnt fixable or changeable
and to this day we remained estranged and i hate it though but

nate
i guess we are who we are
headlights shining in the dark night i drive on
maybe we took this too far

eminem
cause to this day we remain estranged and i hate it though
cause you aint even get to witness your grandbabies grow
but im sorry mama for cleaning out my closet at the time i was angry
rightfully maybe so never meant that far to take it though cause

now i know its not your fault and im not making jokes
that song i no longer play at shows and i cringe every time its on the radio
and i think of nathan being placed in a home and all the medicine you fed us
and how i just wanted you to taste your own but

now the medications taken over and your mental states deteriorating slow
and im way too old to cry that shits painful though
but ma i forgive you so does nathan yo
all you did all you said you did your best to raise us both

foster care that cross you bare few may be as heavy as yours
but i love you debbie mathers oh what a tangled web we have cause
one thing i never asked was where the fuck my deadbeat dad was
fuck it i guess he had trouble keeping up with every address

but idve flipped every mattress every rock and desert cactus
owned a collection of maps and followed my kids to the edge of the atlas
someone ever moved them from me that you could bet your asses
if i had to come down the chimney dressed as santa kidnap em

and although one has only met their grandma
once you pulled up in our drive one night as we were leaving to get some hamburgers
me her and nate we introduced you hugged you
and as you left i had this overwhelming sadness come over me

as we pulled off to go our separate paths and
i saw your headlights as i looked back
and im mad i didnt get the chance to
thank you for being my mom and my dad

so mom please accept this as a tribute i wrote this on the jet
i guess i had to get this off my chest i hope i get the chance to lay it fore im dead
the stewardess said to fasten my seat belt i guess were crashing
so if im not dreaming i hope you this message that i will always love you from afar

cause youre my mama

nate
i guess we are who we are
headlights shining in the dark night i drive on
maybe we took this too far

i want a new life
one without a cause
so im coming home tonight
well no matter what the cost

and if the plane goes down
or if the crew cant wake me up
well just know that im alright
i was not afraid to die

oh even if theres songs to sing
well my children will carry me
just know that im alright
i was not afraid to die

because i put my faith in my new girl
so i never say goodbye cruel world
just know that im alright
i am not afraid to die

i guess we are who we are
headlights shining in the dark night i drive on
maybe we took this too far
i want a new life
