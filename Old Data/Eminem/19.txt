step by step heart to heart left right left 
we all fall down 

step by step heart to heart left right left 
we all fall down like toy soldiers 
bit by bit torn apart we never win 
but the battle wages on for toy soldiers

im supposed to be the soldier who never blows his composure 
even though i hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders 
i aint never supposed to show it my crew aint supposed to know it 
even if it means goin toe to toe with a benzino it dont matter

id never drag them in battles that i can handle unless i absolutely have to 
im supposed to set an example 
i need to be the leader my crew looks for me to guide em 
if some shit ever just pop off im supposed to be beside em

now the ja shit i tried to squash it it was too late to stop it 
theres a certain line you just dont cross and he crossed it 
i heard him say hailies name on a song and i just lost it 
it was crazy this shit be way beyond some jay-z and nas shit 

and even though the battle was won i feel like we lost it
i spent too much energy on it honestly im exhausted 
and im so caught in it i almost feel im the one who caused it 
this aint what im in hip-hop for its not why i got in it 

that was never my object for someone to get killed 
why would i wanna destroy something i helped build
it wasnt my intentions my intentions was good 
i went through my whole career without ever mentionin it

now its just out of respect for not runnin my mouth 
and talkin about something that i knew nothing about
plus dre told me stay out this just wasnt my beef 
so i did i just fell back watched and gritted my teeth 

while hes all over tv down talkin a man
who literally saved my life like fuck it i understand
this is business and this shit just isnt none of my business
but still knowin this shit could pop off at any minute cause

there used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme 
and wouldnt have to worry about one of your people dyin 
but now its elevated cause once you put someones kids in it 
the shit gets escalated it aint just words no more is it

its a different ball game callin names and you aint just rappin 
we actually tried to stop the 50 and ja beef from happenin 
me and dre had sat with him kicked it and had a chat with him
and asked him not to start it he wasnt gonna go after him

until ja started yappin in magazines how we stabbed him
fuck it 50 smash em mash em and let him have it 
meanwhile my attention is pulled in another direction
some receptionist at the source who answers phones at his desk

has an erection for me and thinks that ill be his resurrection
tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record 
but now hes fucked the game up cause one of the ways i came up 
was through that publication the same one that made me famous

now the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothin 
well fuck it that mutherfucker can get it too fuck him then
when im so busy being pissed off i dont stop to think 
that we just inherited 50s beef with murder inc 

and hes inherited mine which is fine aint like either of us mind 
we still have soldiers thats on the front line
thats willing to die for us as soon as we give the orders
never to extort us strictly to show they support us

well maybe shout em out in a rap or up in a chorus 
to show them we love em back and let em know how important it is 
to have runyon avenue soldiers up in our corners
their loyalty to us is worth more than any award is

but i aint tryna have none of my people hurt or murdered 
it aint worth it i cant think of a perfecter way to word it 
than to just say that i love yall too much to see the verdict
ill walk away from it all before i let it go any further 

but dont get it twisted its not a plea that im coppin 
im just willin to be the bigger man if yall can quit poppin
off at your jaws with the knockin cause frankly im sick of talkin
im not gonna let someone elses coffin rest on my conscience cause
