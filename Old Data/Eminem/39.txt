i can feel the heat rising
everything is on fire
todays a painful reminder of why
we can only get brighter
the further you put it behind ya
and right now im on the inside
lookin out cause

i found her in the flames
theres a beautiful kind of pain
setting fire to yesterday
find the light find the light find the light

i found her in the flames
theres a beautiful kind of pain
setting fire to yesterday
find the light find the light find the light

yesterday was the tornado warning today is like the morning after
your world is torn in half you wake and lets wait to start the morning process
rebuilding and youre still a work in progress
today is a whole new chapter its like an enormous ass
the thunderstorm has passed ya your weather didnt poke his eyes out with the thorn bush that you
used to smell the roses stopped to inhale cant even tell your nose is stuffed
so focused on the brightside then you floor the gas pedal and hit the corner fast the more asserted never looking back may hit the curb but everyday is a new learning curve as you steer through life sometimes you might not wanna swerve but you have to to avert a disaster lucky no permanent damage cause they hurt you so bad its like they murdered your ass and threw dirt on your casket but you returned from the ashes and that hurt that you have you just converted to gasoline and while youre burning the past standing at inferno and chant

i found her in the flames
theres a beautiful kind of pain
setting fire to yesterday
find the light find the light find the light

i found her in the flames
theres a beautiful kind of pain
setting fire to yesterday
find the light find the light find the light

so familiarize what having to swallow this pill is like
it happens all the time they take your heart and steal your life
and its as though you feel youve died because youve been killed inside
but yet youre still alive which means you must survive
although today you may weep because youre weak and
everything seems so bleek and hopeless
the light that youre seeking it begins to seep in
thats the only thing keeping you from leaping off the motherfreaking deep end
and im pulling for you to push through this feeling
and with a little time that should do the healing
and by tomorrow you may even feel so good that youre willing
to forgive them even after all that shit you been put through
this feeling of resilience is building and the flames are burning
quick as fire would through this building youre sealed in
but youre fireproof and flame retardant you withstood it
and as you climb up to the roof youre just chillin and you look down
cause youre so over them you could put the heel of your foot through the ceiling

as time passes things change everyday
but wounds wounds heal
but scars still remaining the same
but tomorrow todays gone down in flames
throw the match at the past up place

so feel the fire beneath your feet
as you barely even perspire from the heat
exhale deep and breathe a sigh of relief
and as you say goodbye to the grief
its like watching the walls melt in your prison cell
but youve extinguished this living hell
still a little piece of you dies you scream

i found her in the flames
theres a beautiful kind of pain
setting fire to yesterday
find the light find the light find the light

i found her in the flames
theres a beautiful kind of pain
setting fire to yesterday
find the light find the light find the light

feel the burn watch the smoke as i turn
rising a phoenix from the flames
flame of love were going to fight the word fight
now it feels with these wings that i will fly

i found her in the flames
theres a beautiful kind of pain
setting fire to yesterday
find the light find the light find the light

i found her in the flames
theres a beautiful kind of pain
setting fire to yesterday
find the light find the light find the light
