whats your name marshall
whos your daddy i dont have one
my mother reproduced like a komodo dragon
and had me on the back of a motorcycle
then crashed in the side of loco-motive with rap im loco
its like handing a psycho a loaded handgun
michelangelo with a paint gun in a tantrum
about to explode all over the canvas
back with the yoda of rap in a spasm
your music usually has them
but waned for the game your enthusiasm it hasnt
follow you must rick rubin my little padawan
a jedi in training colossal brain and thoughts of entertaining
but docile and impossible to explain and im also vain and
probably find a way to complain about a picasso painting
puke skywalker but sound like chewbacca when i talk
full of such blind rage i need a seeing eye dog
cant even find the page i was writing this rhyme on oh
its on a rampage couldnt see what i wrote i write small
it says ever since i drove a 79 lincoln with white walls
had a fire in my heart and a dire desire to aspire to die hard
so as long as im on the clock punching this time card
hip hop aint dying on my watch

but sometimes when i’m sleeping she comes to me in my dreams
is she taken is she mine don’t got don’t care don’t have two shits to give
let me take you by the hand to promise land and threaten everyone
cause there’s no rhyme or no reason for nothing

nah whats your name marshall
who’s your daddy i don’t know him but i wonder
is he rich like me haha
has he taken any time to show you what you need to live
no

if he had he wouldn’t have ended up in these rhymes on my pad
i wouldn’t be so mad my attitude wouldn’t be so bad yeah dad
im the epitome and the prime example of what happens
when the power of the rhyme falls into the wrong hands and
makes you want to get up and start dancing
even if it is charles manson who just happens to be rapping
blue lights flashing laughing all the way to the bank
lamping in my k-mart mansion i’m in the style department
with a pile in my car ripping the aisle apart
with great power comes absolutely no responsiblity for content
completely despondent and condescending
the king of nonsense and controversy is on a
beat killing spree your honor i must plead
guilty cause i sparked a revolution
rebel without a cause who caused the evolution of rap
to take it to the next level boost it
but several rebuked it and whoever produced it
hip hop is the devils music is that me it belongs to me
cuz i just happen to be a white honky devil with two horns
that dont honk but every time i speak you hear a beep
but lyrically i never hear a peep not even a whisper
rappers better stay clear of me bitch
cause its the…

time of the season when hate runs high
and this time wont give it to you easy when i take back whats mine with pleasured hands and torture everyone that is my plan my job here isnt done
cause there’s no rhyme or no reason for nothing

whats your name shady
who’s your daddy i don’t give a fuck but i wonder
is he rich like me doubt it ha
has he taken any time to show you what you need to live

so yeah dad lets walk
lets have us a father and son talk
but i bet we wouldnt probably  get one block
without me knocking your block off
this is all your fault
maybe thats why im so bananas
i appeal to all those walks of life
whoever had strife
maybe thats what dad and son talks are like
cause i related to the struggles of young america
when their fucking parents were unaware of their troubles
now theyre ripping out their fucking hair again
its hysterical i chuckle
cause everybody bloodies their bare knuckles
yeah uh oh better beware knuckleheads
the sound of my hustle says dont knock
the doors broken it wont lock
it might just fly open get cold cocked
you critics come pay to me a visit
misery loves company please stay a minute
kryptonite to a hypocrite
zip your lip if you dish it but cant take it
too busy getting stoned in your glass house
to kick rocks and you wonder why i lash out
mister mathers as advertised on the flyers
spread the word cause im promoting my passion till im passed out
a completely brain dead rainman
doing a bankhead in a restraint chair
so bitch if you shoot me a look it better be a blank stare
or get shanked in the pancreas im angrier than
all 8 of the reindeer put together with chief keef
cause i hate every fucking thing yeah
even this rhyme bitch and quit tryna look
for a fucking reason for it that aint there
but i still am a criminal
ten year old degenerate grabbing on my genitals
the last mathers lp that went diamond
this time im predicting this one will go emerald
when will the madness end how can it when
theres no method the pad and pen
the only message that i have to say is
dad im back at it again
bitch
