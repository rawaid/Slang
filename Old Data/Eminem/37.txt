since me and elton played career russian roulette 
and never even seen me blink or get to busting a sweat 
people stepping over people just to rush to the set

just to get to see an mc who breathes so freely 
ease over these beats and be so breezy 
jesus how can shit be so easy 
how can one chandra be so levy

turn on these beats mcs dont see me
believe me bet and mtv 
are gonna grieve when we leave dawg fo sheezy 
cant leave rap alone the game needs me

into the mountains nothing but clowns down here 
but we aint fucking around round here
