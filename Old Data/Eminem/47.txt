and walk around the party without a care like a body without a head
lookin like a zombie from night of the livin dead
and tomorrow probably still be too high to get out of bed

till i feel like ive been hit with the sharp part of the hammer

i shoot the gift like im hollerin die santa
missed the tree and hit rudolf and 2 innocent bystanders

so quit tryin to play the wall like youre paul and
get on the floor when the beat drops and stop stallin

but everyone knows that no one likes to be alone
so get on the floor and grab somebody
