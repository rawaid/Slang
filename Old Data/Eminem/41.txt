im a soldier
im a soldier yo 

never was a thug just infatuated with guns
never was a gangster till i graduated to one
and got the rep of a villain for weapon concealin
took the image of a thug kept shit appealing

willin to stick out my neck for respect if it meant life or death
never lived to regret what i said
when youre me people just wanna see if its true
if its you what you say in your raps is what you do

so they feel its part of ya obligation to fulfill
when they see you on the streets face to face are you for real
the confrontation aint no conversation if you feel
youre in violation any hesitationll get you killed

if you feel it kill it if you can conceal it reveal it
being reasonable will leave you full of bullets pull it squeeze it
till its empty tempt me push me pussies
i need a good reason to give this trigger a good squeeze

im a soldier
these shoulders hold up so much
they wont budge ill never fall or fold up
im a soldier
even if my collar bones crush or crumble
i will never slip or stumble

im a soldier
these shoulders hold up so much
they wont budge ill never fall or fold up
im a soldier
even if my collar bones crush or crumble
i will never slip or stumble

i love pissing you off it gets me off
like my lawyers when the fucking judge lets me off
all you motherfuckers gotta do is set me off
im violating all the motherfucking bets be off

im a lit fuse anything i do bitch is news
pistol whipping mother fucker bouncer 62
who needs bullets as soon as i pull it you sweat bullets 
an excellent method to get rid of the next bully

its actually better cause instead of you murdering
you can hurt em then come back again and kick dirt in them
its like pouring salt in your wounds assault and get sued
you can smell the lawsuits as soon as i waltz in the room

everybodys hearts just stop they call the cops
all you see is bitches coming out their halter tops
running and ducking at the hot rocks parking lot
youll all get shot whether its your fault or not

cause im a soldier
these shoulders hold up so much
they wont budge ill never fall or fold up
im a soldier
even if my collar bones crush or crumble
i will never slip or stumble

im a soldier
these shoulders hold up so much
they wont budge ill never fall or fold up
im a soldier
even if my collar bones crush or crumble
i will never slip or stumble

i spit it slow so these kids know that im talking to em
give it back to these damn critics and sock it to em
im like a thug with a little bit of pac influence
i spew it and look how i got you bitches rocking to it

you motherfuckers could never do it like i can do it
dont even try youll look stupid do not pursue it
dont ever in your life try to knock the truest
i spill the illest shit ever could drive me to it

so ticky-tock listen as the sound ticks on the clock
listen to the sound of kim as she licks on the cock
listen to the sound of me spilling my heart through this pen
motherfuckers know that ill never be marshall again

full of controversy until i retire my jersey
til the fire inside dies and expires at 30
and lord have mercy on anymore of these rappers that verse me
and put a curse on authorities in the face of adversity

im a soldier
these shoulders hold up so much
they wont budge ill never fall or fold up
im a soldier
even if my collar bones crush or crumble
i will never slip or stumble

im a soldier
these shoulders hold up so much
they wont budge ill never fall or fold up
im a soldier
even if my collar bones crush or crumble
i will never slip or stumble
