im friends with the monster thats under my bed
get along with the voices inside of my head
you trying to save me stop holding your breath
and you think im crazy yeah you think im crazy

i wanted the fame but not the cover of newsweek
oh well guess beggars cant be choosey
wanted to receive attention for my music
wanted to be left alone public excuse me

fame made me a balloon cause my ego inflated
when i blew seep it was confusing
cause all i wanted to do is be the bruce lee of loose leaf

abused ink used it as a tool when i blew steam
ooh hit the lottery oh wee
with what i gave up to get was bittersweet
