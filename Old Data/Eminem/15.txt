this is survival of the fittest
this is do or die
this is the winner takes it all
so take it all

[verse 1]
wasnt ready to be no millionaire i was ill-prepared
i was prepared to be ill though the skill was there
in the beginning it wasnt bout the ends
it was bout busting raps and standing for something fuck an acronym
cut the fucking act like youre happy im fucking back again
with another anthem why stop when it doesnt have to end
it aint over til i say its over â€“ enough when i say enough
throw me to them wolves and close the gate up
im afraid of whatll happen to them wolves
when the thought of being thrown into an alligator pit i salivated it
raise your hands up like its 12 noon nah homie
hold them bitches straighter up wave em til you dislocate a rotator cuff
came up rough came to ruffle feathers nah egos
i aint deflate enough last chance to make this whole stadium erupt

[verse 2]
i can see the finish line with each line that i finish
im so close to my goals i can almost pole vault over the goal post
and if i dont got enough in the tank maybe i can just siphon enough
to fill up this last can man will i survive in this climate or what
they said i was washed up and got a blood bath
im not a rapper im an adapter i can adjust
plus i can just walk up to a mic and just bust
so floors open if youd like to discuss
top 5 in this mothafucka and if i dont make the cut
what like i give a fuck i will light this bitch up like im driving a truck
into the side of a pump 0 to 60 hop in and gun it
like g-unit without the hyphen im hyping em up
and if there should ever come a time where my lifes in a rut
and i look like i might just give up eh you mightve mistook
me for bowing out i aint taking a bow im stabbing myself
with a fucking knife in the gut while im wiping my butt
cause i just shitted on the mic and i like getting cut
i get excited at the sight of my blood youre in a fight with a nut
cause imma fight til i die or win
biting the dust itll just make me angrier wait
let me remind you of what got me this far picture me quitting
now draw a circle around it and put a line through it slut
its survival of what

[hook]

[verse 3]
so get your ideas stack your ammo
but dont come unless you come to battle im mad now jump in the saddle
this is it its what you eat sleep piss and shit
live breathe your whole existence just consists of this
refuse to quit fuse is lit cant diffuse the wick
i dont do this music shit i lose my shit
aint got shit to lose its the moment of truth
its all i know how to do as soon as i get thrown in the booth i spit
but my respect is overdue im showing you the flow no one do
cause i dont own no diploma for school i quit
so theres nothing for me to fall back on i know no other trades
so youd better trade your fucking mics in for some tool-box-es
cause youll never take my pride from me
itll have to be pried from me so pull out your pliers and your screwdrivers
but i want you to doubt me i dont want you to buh-lieve
cause this is something that i must use to suc-ceed
and if you dont like me then fuck you
self es-teem must be fucking shooting through-the-roof cause trust me
my skin is too thick and bul-let proof to touch me
i can see why the fuck i disgust you
i must be a-llergic to failure cause everytime i come close to it
i just sneeze but i just go atchoo then achieve
