yo i cant sing it 
i feel like singin 
i wanna fuckinsing 
cause im happy 
yeah im happy 
ha ha 
i got my baby back 
yo check it out 

some days i sit starin out the window
watchinthis world pass me by
sometimes i think theres nothin to live for
i almost break down and cry

somtimes i think im crazy
im crazy oh so crazy
why am i here am i just wasting my time
but then i see my baby
suddenly im not crazy
it all makes sense when i look into her eyes

cause somtimes it feels like the worlds on my shoulders
everyones leanin on me
cause sometimes it feels like the worlds almost over
but then she comes back to me

my baby girl keeps gettin older
i watch her grow up with pride
people make jokes cause they dont understand me
they just dont see my real side

i act like shit dont phase me
inside it drives me crazy
my insecurities could eat me alive
but then i see my baby
suddenly im not crazy
it all makes sense when i look into her eyes

cause somtimes it feels like the worlds on my shoulders
everyones leanin on me
cause sometimes it feels like the worlds almost over
but then she comes back to me

man if i could sing id keep singing this song to my daughter
if i could hit the notes id blow something as long as my father
to show her how i feel about her how proud i am that i got her
god im a daddy im so glad that her mom didnt want her

now you probly get this picture from my public persona
that im a pistol-packing drug-addict who bags on his mama
but i wanna just take this time out to be perfectly honest
cause theres a lot of shit i keep bottled that hurts deep inside o my soul

and just know that i grow colder the older i grow
this boulder on my shoulder gets heavy and harder to hold
and this load is like the weight of the world
and i think my neck is breaking should i just give up
or try to live up to these expectations

now look i love my daughter more than life in itself
but i got a wife thats determined to make my life livin hell
but i handle it well given the circumstances im dealt
so many chances man its too bad coulda had someone else

but the years that ive wasted are nothing to the tears that ive tasted
so heres what im facin 3 felonies 6 years of probation
ive went to jail for this woman ive been to bat for this woman
ive taken bats to peoples backs bent over backwards for this woman

man i shoulda seen it comin whyd i stick my penis up in
woulda ripped the pre-nup up if id seen what she was fuckin
but fuck it its over theres no more reason to cry no more
i got my baby baby the only lady that i adore hailie

so sayonara try tomorra nice to know ya
my babys travelled back to the arms of her rightful owner
and suddenly it seems that my shoulder blades have just shifted
its like the greatest gift you can get the weight has been lifted

now it dont feel like the worlds on my shoulders
everyones leaninon me
cause my baby knows that her daddys a soldier
nothin can take her from me

woo 
i told you i cant sing 
oh well i tried 
hailie member when i said 
if you ever need anything daddy will be right there 
well guess what 
daddys here 
and i aint goin nowhere baby 
i love you
