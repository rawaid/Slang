[intro eminem]
cause sometimes you just feel tired
feel weak and when you feel weak you feel like you wanna just give up
but you gotta search within you you gotta find that inner strength
and just pull that shit out of you and get that motivation to not give up
and not be a quitter no matter how bad you wanna just fall flat on your face and collapse

[b/w intro]
yo left yo left yo left right left
yo left yo left yo left right left

yo left yo left yo left right left

[verse #1 eminem]
till i collapse i’m spilling these raps long as you feel em
till the day that i drop youll never say that im not killing them
cause when i am not then ima stop penning em
and i am not hip-hop and i’m just not eminem
subliminal thoughts when im stop sending them women are caught in webs spin and hauk venom
adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illing to stop
amoxacilin is just not real enough
the criminal cop killing hip-hop filling a minimal swap to cop millions of pac listeners
youre coming with me feel it or not you’re gonna fear it like i showed you the spirit of god lives in us
you hear it a lot lyrics that shock is it a miracle or am i just a product of pop fizzing up
for sizzle my whizzle this is the plot listen up you bizzles forgot slizzle does not give a fuck

[chorus - natedogg]
till the roof comes off till the lights go out
till my legs give out can’t shut my mouth
till the smoke clears out - am i high perhaps
ima rip this shit till my bone collapse
till the roof comes off till the lights go out
till my legs give out can’t shut my mouth
till the smoke clears out - am i high perhaps
ima rip this shit till my bone collapse

[verse #2 eminem]
music is like magic there’s a certain feeling you get when youre real
and you spit and people are feeling your shit
this is your moment and every single minute you spend trying to hold onto it
cause you may never get it again
so while you’re in it try to get as much shit as you can
and when your run is over just admit when its at its end
cause im at the end of my wits with half this shit that gets in
i got a list heres the order of my list that its in
it goes reggie jay-z tupac and biggie andre from outkast jada kurupt nas and then me
but in this industry im the cause of a lot of envy so when i’m not put on this list the shit does not offend me
thats why you see me walk around like nothings bothering me
even though half you people got a fucking problem with me
you hate it but you know respect youve got to give me
the presss wet dream like bobby and whitney nate hit me

[chorus - natedogg]
till the roof comes off till the lights go out
till my legs give out can’t shut my mouth
till the smoke clears out - am i high perhaps
ima rip this shit till my bone collapse
till the roof comes off till the lights go out
till my legs give out can’t shut my mouth
till the smoke clears out - am i high perhaps
ima rip this shit till my bone collapse

[verse #3 eminem]
soon as a verse starts i eat it at mc’s heart
what is he thinking how not to go against me smart
and its absurd how people hang on every word
i’ll probably never get the props i feel i ever deserve
but i’ll never be served my spot is forever reserved
if i ever leave earth that would be the death of me first
cause in my heart of hearts i know nothing could ever be worse
that’s why i’m clever when i put together every verse
my thoughts are sporadic i act like i’m an addict
i rap like i’m addicted to smack like i’m kim mathers
but i don’t want to go forth and back in constant battles
the fact is i would rather sit back and bomb some rappers
so this is like a full blown attack i’m launching at them
the track is on some battling raps who want some static
cause i don’t really think that the fact that i’m slim matters
a plaque of platinum status is whack if im not the baddest

[chorus - natedogg]

[outro]
[eminem &amp; natedogg echo]
until the roof until the roof
the roof comes off the roof comes off
until my legs until my legs
give out from underneath me give out form underneath me

[eminem]
i i will not fall
i will stand tall
feels like no one can beat me
