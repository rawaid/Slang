yeah
its my life
my own words i guess

have you ever loved someone so much youd give an arm for
not the expression no literally give an arm for
when they know theyre your heart
and you know you were their armor

and you will destroy anyone who would try to harm em
but what happens when karma turns right around and bites you
and everything you stand for turns on you to spite you
what happens when you become the main source of a pain
daddy look what i made dads gotta go catch a plane

daddy wheres mommy i cant find mommy where is she
