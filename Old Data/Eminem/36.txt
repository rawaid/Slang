you know technically im not even supposed to be here right now
so fuck it
some of us dont get a second chance

who can catch lightnin in a bottle set fire to water
comin out the nozzle on a fire hose flyer than swatters
cinderella man cinderella man cinderella man cinderella man
smash an hourglass grab the sand take his hands and cup em
spit a rhyme to freeze the clock; take the hands of time and cuff em
cinderella man cinderella man cinderella man cinderella man

theres a storm comin that the weatherman couldnt predict
i start the bug prick you better flea cause i get ticked
its a wrap; i was down when i was down i was kicked
i got up im back to punch you to the ground youre tricked

its a trap; fuck my last cd that shits in my trash
ill be goddamned if another rapper gets in my ass
i hit the gas and i spit every rap as if its my last
you can die in the blink of an eye so bat your eyelashes

and keep winkin and blowin kisses cause youre flirtin with death
im destroyin your livelihood i aint just hurtin your rep
i catch a flow and get goin; no remorse im showin aint slowin for no one
knowin theres nothin you can do about it

zeroin on my target like a marksman the target is you
i shut your lane down took your spot; parked in it too
arsenic flow lighter fluid salivaâ€”what can you do
go get your crew to hype you up; stand behind you like wooh

that boys hot enough to melt hell burn satan too
fry his ass and put his ashes back together with glue
so you can hate him he dont blame you; frankly he would too
this game could ill-afford to lose him; how bout you

now guess who hey heres a clue hey
he came to the ball in his wife beater lost his nike shoe
its in your ass hey hes in your ass; hes all up in your psyche too hey
now whats his name

cinderella man cinder-fella shady dane
came to wrap the game up in cellophane raise hell; from hell he came
but didnt come to bore ya with the cinderella story
nor did he come to do the same ol; cant afford to be a lame-o

in this day and age and at this stage of the game
mediocrity can no longer be allowed to fly
so say bye to the old h-i to the new que sera
consider it his last hurrah the coup de grace; raise em high

in the sky keep em out time to bring the place alive
thanks for bein patient; i wont make no more mistakes shit
my potatoes baked homie the veggies on my plate can fly
my filet is smokin weed; yeah faggot the stakes are high

shit i aint even spposed to be here by the grace of god
the skin on my teeth and a hair on my nuts i skated by

how fuckin irritated are you how much in your face am i

and aint shit you can do but fear it; proof is here in spirit
and im his spittin image; i mirror it when i stand near it
your pussy lyric i cunt hear it
