i own a mansion but live in a house
a king-size bed but i sleep on the couch
im mr brightside glass is half full
but my tank is half empty gasket just blew

this always happens 30 minutes from home
gotta lay a log cabin and only option i have is mcdonalds bathroom
in a public stall dropping a football
so every time someone walks in the john i get madden
shady what up- what come on man im crapping
and youre asking me for my goddamn autograph on a napkin
oh thats odd i just happened to run out of tissue
yeah hand me that on second thought id be glad then
thanks dawg names todd a big fan
i wiped my ass with it crumbled it up in a wad and threw it back and
told him todd youre the shit when does all of this crap end
cant park my ass without causing an accident
puff my gas cut my grass cant take out the fucking trash
without someone passing through my sub harassing
id count my blessings but i suck at math
id rather wallow then bass suffering from succotash
but the antacid is my stomach gas
i mix my corn with my fucking mash
potato so what ho kiss my country bumpkin ass
missouri southern roots what the fuck is upper class
call lunch dinner call dinner supper
tupperware in a covered plastic wear up the ass
stuck in the past ipod what the fuck is that
b-boy to the core mule im a stubborn ass

maybe thats why i feel so strange
got it all but i still wont change
maybe thats why i cant leave detroit
its the motivation that keeps me going
this is the inspiration i need
i can never turn my back on a city that made me
lifes been good to me so far

nintendo bitch run jump punch stab and i melt the
mozzarella on my spaghetti put in on bread
make a sandwich with welchs and belch
they say this spray butter is bad for my health but
i think theres more white trash from the trailer
jed clampett redd sanford welfare mentality helps to
keep me grounded thats why i never take full advantage of wealth i
managed to dwell within these parameters
still cramming the shelves full of hamburger helper
i cant even help it this is the hand i was dealt to
creature of habit feel like im trapped in an animal shelter
with all these pet peeves
god dammit to hell i cant stand all these kids with their camera cellphones
i cant go anywhere i get so mad i can yell the
other day someone got little elaborate and stuck a fucking dead cat in my mailbox
went to burger king they spit on my onion rings
i think my karma is catching up with me

maybe thats why i feel so strange
got it all but i still wont change
maybe thats why i cant leave detroit
its the motivation that keeps me going
this is the inspiration i need
i can never turn my back on a city that made me
lifes been good to me so far

in produce hunched over giant nosebleed

chuckling couldnt do nothing play it off
what you bumping trunk muzik yelawolfs better fucking bitch
they want me to flip at the label but i wont succumb to it
the pressure they want me to follow up with another one after recovery
was so highly coveted but what good is a fucking recovery if i fumble it
cause imma drop the ball if i dont get a grip
hopping on shrubbery on you sons of bitches
wrong subdivison to fuck with bitch

i love my titty but you push me to my limit what a pity
the shit i complain about
its like there aint a cloud in the sky and its raining out
kool aid stain on the couch id never get it out
bitch i got an elevator in my house
ants and a mouse im living the dream

maybe thats why i feel so strange
got it all but i still wont change
maybe thats why i cant leave detroit
its the motivation that keeps me going
this is the inspiration i need
i can never turn my back on a city that made me
lifes been good to me so far
