we touch i feel a rush we clutch it isnt much
but its enough to make me wonder whats in store for us
its lust its torturous you must be a sorceress
cause you just did the impossible gained my trust

dont play games itll be dangerous if you fuck me over
cause if i get burnt ima show ya what its like to hurt
cause ive been treated like dirt before ya
and love is evil spell it backwards ill show ya

nobody knows me im cold walk down this road all alone
its no ones fault but my own its the path ive chosen to go
frozen as snow i show no emotion whatsoever so
dont ask me why i have no love for these mofuckin hoes

blood sucking succubuses what the fuck is up with this
ive tried in this department but i aint had no luck with this
it sucks but its exactly what i thought it would be
like trying to start over

i got a hole in my heart like some kind of emotional roller coaster
something i wont go on so you toy with my emotions ho its over
its like an explosion every time i hold ya wasnt joking when i told ya
you take my breath away youre a supernova and im a

im a space-bound rocket ship and your hearts the moon
and im aiming right at you right at you
250000 miles on a clear night in june
and im aiming right at you right at you right at you

ill do whatever it takes when im with you i get the shakes
my body aches when i aint with you i have zero strength
theres no limit on how far i would go no boundaries no lengths
why do we say that until we get that person that we thinks

gonna be that one and then once we get em its never the same
you want em when they dont want you soon as they do feelings change
its not a contest and i aint on no conquest for no mate
i wasnt looking when i stumbled on to you must have been fate

but so much is at stake what the fuck does it take
lets cut to the chase fore the door shuts in your face
promise me if i cave in and break and leave myself open
that i wont be making a mistake cause im a

im a space-bound rocket ship and your hearts the moon
and im aiming right at you right at you
250000 miles on a clear night in june
and im aiming right at you right at you right at you

so after a year and six months its no longer me that you want
but i love you so much it hurts never mistreated you once
i poured my heart out to you let down my guard swear to god
ill blow my brains in your lap lay here and die in your arms

drop to my knees and im pleading im trying to stop you from leaving
you wont even listen so fuck it im trying to stop you from breathing
i put both hands on your throat i sit on top of you squeezing
till i snap your neck like a popsicle stick

aint no possible reason i could think of
to let you walk up out this house and let you live
tears streamed down both of my cheeks then i let you go and just give
and fore i put that gun to my temple i told you this

and i wouldve did anything for you
to show you how much i adored you
but its over now its too late to save our love
just promise me youll think of me
every time you look up in the sky and see a star cause im a

im a space-bound rocket ship and your hearts the moon
and im aiming right at you right at you
250000 miles on a clear night in june
and im so lost without you without you without you
