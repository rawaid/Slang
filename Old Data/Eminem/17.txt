aight man whatever

spoken
dre just let it run
hey yo turn the beat up a little bit
hey yo this song is for anyone fuck it just shut up and listen
hey yo

i sit back with this pack of zig zags and this bag
of this weed it gives me the shit needed to be
the most meanest mc on this on this earth
and since birth ive been cursed with this curse to just curse

and just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
and it sells and it helps in itself to relieve
all this tension dispensin these sentences gettin this stress
thats been eatin me recently off of this chest

and i rest again peacefully peacefully
but at least have the decency in you
to leave me alone when you freaks see me out
in the streets when im eatin or feedin my daughter

to not come and speak to me speak to me
i dont know you and no i dont owe you a mo-therfuck-ing thing
im not mr *nsync im not what your friends think
im not mr friendly i can be a prick

if you tempt me my tank is on empty is on empty
no patience is in me and if you offend me
im liftin you 10 feet 10 feet in the air
i dont care who was there and who saw me destroy you

go call you a lawyer file you a lawsuit
ill smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
im tired of arguin of arguin
i dont mean to be mean but thats all i can be its just me

and i am whatever you say i am
if i wasnt then why would i say i am
in the paper the news every day i am
radio wont even play my jam

cause i am whatever you say i am
if i wasnt then why would i say i am
in the paper the news every day i am
i dont know its just the way i am

sometimes i just feel like my father i hate to be bothered
with all of this nonsense its constant
and oh its his lyrical content
that song guilty conscience has gotten such rotten responses

and all of this controversy circles me
and it seems like the media immediately
points a finger at me finger at me
so i point one back at em but not the index or pinky

or the ring or the thumb its the one you put up
when you dont give a fuck when you wont just put up
with the bullshit they pull cause they full of shit too
when a dudes gettin bullied and shoots up his school

and they blame it on marilyn on marilyn and the heroin
where were the parents at and look where its at
middle america now its a tragedy
now its so sad to see an upper class city

havin this happenin this happenin
then attack eminem cause i rap this way rap this way
but im glad cause they feed me the fuel that i need for the fire
to burn and its burnin and i have returned

and i am whatever you say i am
if i wasnt then why would i say i am
in the paper the news every day i am
radio wont even play my jam

cause i am whatever you say i am
if i wasnt then why would i say i am
in the paper the news every day i am
i dont know its just the way i am

im so sick and tired of bein admired
that i wish that i would just die or get fired
and dropped from my label lets stop with the fables
im not gonna be able to top on my name is

and pigeonholed into some poppy sensation
that copped me rotation at rock n roll stations
and i just do not got the patience got the patience
to deal with these cocky caucasians

who think im some wigger who just tries to be black
cause i talk with an accent and grab on my balls
so they always keep askin the same fuckin questions fuckin questions
what school did i go to what hood i grew up in

the why the who what when the where and the how
till im grabbin my hair and im tearin it out ahhh
cause they drivin me crazy me crazy
i cant take it im racin im pacin i stand and i sit

and im thankful for every fan that i get
but i cant take a shit in the bathroom without someone standin by it
no i wont sign your autograph
you can call me an asshole im glad

cause i am whatever you say i am
if i wasnt then why would i say i am
in the paper the news every day i am
radio wont even play my jam

cause i am whatever you say i am
if i wasnt then why would i say i am
in the paper the news every day i am
i dont know its just the way i am
