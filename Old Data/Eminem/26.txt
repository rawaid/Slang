eminem with polina 
tell me where to go tell me what to do
ill be right there for you
tell me what to say no matter if its true
ill say it all for you

i used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky is falling
why am i so differently wired am i a martian
what kind of twisted experiment am i involved in
cause i dont belong in this world that’s why im scoffing

at authority defiant often flying off at
the handle at my mom no dad so i’m non-com-
-pliant at home at school i’m just shy and awkward
and no i don’t need no goddamn psychologist

tryna diagnose why i have all these underlying problems
thinking he can try and solve them
i’m outside chalking up drawings on the sidewalk
and in the front drive talking to myself

either that or inside hiding off in the corner somewhere quiet
trying not to be noticed cause im crying and sobbing
i had a bad day at school so i aint talking
some cocksucker shoved me into a fucking locker cause he said that i eyeballed him

and if you fall ill get you there
ill be your savior from all the wars that are fought
inside your world please have faith in my words

cause this is my legacy legacy eh
this is my legacy legacy eh
there’s no guarantee it’s not up to me you can only see
this is my legacy legacy
legacy legacy

i used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky is falling
why am i so differently wired in my noggin
cause sporadic as my thoughts come its mind boggling
cause i obsess on everything in my mind is small shit

bothers me but now my father he said sayonara
and then split but i don’t give a shit im fine long as
theres batteries in my walkman nothing is the matter with me
shit look at the bright side at least i aint walking

i bike ride through the neighborhood of my apartment
complex on a ten speed which ive acquired parts that i
find in the garbage a frame then put tires on it
headphones on straight ahead kids tryna start shit

but if this is all there is for me life offers
why bother even try and put up a fight its nonsense
but i think a light bulb just lit up in my conscience
what about them rhymes ive been jottin theyre kinda giving me confidence

instead of tryna escape through my comics
why dont i just blast a little something like onyx
to put me in the mood to wanna fight and write songs that
say what i wanna say to the kid that said that i eyeballed him

grab hold of my balls like thats right fights on bitch
who wouldve knew from the moment i turned the mic on that
i could be iconic in my conquest is
thats word to phife dawg from a tribe called quest

this is my legacy legacy eh
this is my legacy legacy eh
there’s no guarantee it’s not up to me you can only see
this is my legacy legacy
legacy legacy

i used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky is falling
now i think the fact that im differently wireds awesome
cause if i wasnt i wouldnt be able to work
words like this and connect lines like crosswords

and use my enemys words as strength
to try and draw from and get inspired off em
cause all my life i was told and taught i am not shit
by you whack fucking giant sacks of lying dog shit

now you shut up bitch i am talking
thought i was full of horseshit and now you fucking worship the ground on which i am walking
me against the world so what im brian dawkins
versus the whole 0 and 16 lions offense

so bring on the giants falcons and miami dolphins
its the body bag game bitch im supplying coffins
cause you dicks butt-kiss a bunch of brian baldingers
you gon die a ball-licker

ive been diabolical with this dialogue since 99 rawkus
you dont respect the legacy i leave behind yall can
suck a dick the day you beat me pigsll fly out my ass
and a flying saucer full of italian sausage

the most high exalting and i aint halting
till i die of exhaustion inhale my exhaust fumes
the best part about me is i am not you
im me and im the fire marshal and

this is my legacy legacy eh
this is my legacy legacy eh
there’s no guarantee it’s not up to me you can only see
this is my legacy legacy
legacy legacy
