who can say fore sure
perhaps a frontal lobotomy would be the answer
if science can operate on this distorted brain and put it to good use
society will reap a great benefit

i walk around like a space cadet place your bets
on whos likely to become a serial killer case of tourettes
fuck fuck fuck cant take the stress
i make a mess as the day progresses
angry and take it out on the neighbors hedges
like this is how ill cut your face up bitches
with these hedge trimming scissors with razor edges
imaginations dangerous its the only way to escape this
mess and make the best of this situation i guess
cuz i feel like a little bitch this predicaments  despicable
im sick of just getting pushed its ridiculous
i look like a freaking wuss a pussy
this kid just took my stick of liquorice
and threw my sticker books in a picker bush
i wanna kick his tush but i was six and shook
this fucker was 12 and was 6 foot with a vicious hook
he hit me i fell i got back up all i did was book now theres using your head

mama always said if you had a brain youd be dangerous
a brain youd be dangerous mama could be wrong
mama ima grow a name and be famous
and imma be a pain in the anus
mama could be wrong
imma use my head as a weapon
find a way to escape this insaneness
mama always said son if you had a brain youd be dangerous
guess it pays to be brainless

fast forward some years later
a teenager this is a fun sweet
i just got jumped twice in one week its complete
its usually once a month this is some feat ive accomplished
theyve stomped me into the mud for what reason you stumped me
but how do you get the shit beat out of you be down and be upbeat
when you dont have no-thing no valid shot at life
chance to make it or succeed
cuz youre doomed from the start
its like you grew up on drug street from jump street
but if i had just get my head out my ass
i could accomplish any task
practicing trash talking in a trance
locked in my room yeah but i got some plans mama
these damn rhymes are falling
out of my pants pocket i cant stop it
and im starting to blend in more school this shit helps for sure
im getting more self assured than ive ever been before
plus no one picks on me anymore i done put a stop to that
threw my first punch end of story
still in my skulls a vacant empty void
been using it more as a bin for storage
take some inventory and as gorge as a ford engine door hinge syringe an orange an extension cord and a ninja sword
not to mention four lynch pins and a stringent stored ironing board a bench a wrench or winch and a tangent whore
everything but a brain but domes off the fucking chain
like an independent store somethings wrong with my head
just think if i had a brain in it thank god that i dont
cause id probably be dahmer cause mama always said

mama always said if you had a brain youd be dangerous
a brain youd be dangerous mama could be wrong
mama ima grow a name and be famous
and imma be a pain in the anus
mama could be wrong
imma use my head as a weapon
find a way to escape this insaneness
mama always said son if you had a brain youd be dangerous
guess it pays to be brainless

now my mum goes “womp womp womp”
cause im not that smart but im not dumb
i was on a bottom of the pile getting stomped
but somehow i came out on top

i told you one day i said theyd have that red carpet rolled out yo
im nice yo fuck it im out cold
now everywhere i go they scream out go
im bout to clean house yo
im lysol now im just household
outsold the sell outs freak the hell out
middle america hear them yell out
until they were so scared and those kids
just about belted out
whatever spout that it fell out
of my smart aleck mouth it was so weird
inappropriate so be it i dont see it
maybe one day when the smoke clears it wont be as
motherfuckin difficult ye till then
hopefully you little homos get over your fears and grow beards
its okay to be scared straight they said i provoke queers
till emotions evoke tears my whole careers a stroke of sheer genius
smoke and mirrors tactical practical jokes yeah
you motherfuckin insert insult here
who the fuck wouldve thought that one little lone mc would be able to take the whole culture and re-upholstery it
and boy did they flock
cant believe this little hick locked
this hip hop shit in his hip pocket
and still the shit got that
white trash traffic and gridlock
shit hopping like a six blocks from a kid rock
insane clown posse concert in mid-october
and god forbid i see a wizard and get a brain in my titanium cranium dog
cause i turn into the unabomber mama always said

insaneness aint even a word you stupid fuck
neither is aint
