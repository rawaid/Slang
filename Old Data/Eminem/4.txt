well if you want shady this is what ill give ya
a little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor

some vodka thatll jump start my heart quicker
then a shock when i get shocked at the hospital
by the doctor when im not cooperating
when im rocking the table while hes operating hey

you waited this long to stop debating
cause im back im on the rag and ovulating
i know that you got a job ms cheney
but your husbands heart problems complicating

so the fcc wont let me be 
or let me be me so let me see
they tried to shut me down on mtv
but it feels so empty without me

so come on dip bum on your lips
fuck that cum on your lips and some on your tits
and get ready cause this shits about to get heavy
i just settled all my lawsuits fuck you debbie

now this looks a job for me
so everybody just follow me
cause we need a little controversy
cause it feels so empty without me 

i said this looks like a job for me

little hellions kids feeling rebellious
embarrassed their parents still listen to elvis
they start feeling like prisoners helpless
till osama comes along on a mission and yells bitch

a visionary vision is scary
could start a revolution pollutin the air waves 
a rebel so let me just revel and bask
in the fact that i got everyone kissin my ass

and its a disaster such a catastrophe
for you to see so damn much of my ass you ask for me
well im back - na-na na-na na-na na-na na-na
fix your bent antenna tune it in and then im gonna enter in it 

up under your skin like a splinter
the center of attention back for the winter
im interesting the best thing since wrestling
infesting in your kids ears and nesting

testing attention please
feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
heres my 10 cents my 2 cents is free
a nuisance who sent you sent for me 

now this looks a job for me
so everybody just follow me

ive been dope suspenseful with a pencil
ever since prince turned himself into a symbol

but sometimes the shit just seems
everybody only wants to discuss me
so this must mean im disgusting
but its just me im just obscene hey

though im not the first king of controversy
i am the worst thing since elvis presley
to do black music so selfishly
and use it to get myself wealthy hey

theres a concept that works
20 million other white rappers emerge
but no matter how many fish in the sea
itll be so empty without me
