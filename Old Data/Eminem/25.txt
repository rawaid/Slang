it’s like im in this dirt digging up old hurt
tried everything to get my mind off you it won’t work
all it takes is one song on the radio you’re right back on it
reminding me all over again how you fucking just brushed me off
and left me so burned spent a lot of time trying to soul search
maybe i needed to grow up a little first
well looks like i hit a growth spurt
but i am coming for closure
don’t suppose an explanation i’m owed for
the way that you turned your back on me
just when i may have needed you most
oh you thought it was over
you can just close the chapter
and go about your life like it was nothing
you ruined mine but you seem to be doing fine
i’d never recovered but tonight i betcha that whatcha
bout to go through’s tougher than anything i ever have suffered
can’t think of a better way to define poetic justice
can i hold grudges mind is saying let it go fuck this
heart is saying i will once i bury this bitch alive
hide the shovel and then drive off in the sunset

i flee the scene like it was my last ride
you see right through
oh you had me pegged the first time
you cant see the truth
but its easier to justify
whats bad is good
and i hate to be the bad guy
i just hate to be the bad guy

and to think i used to think you was the shit bitch
to think it was you at one time i worshipped shit
think you can hurt people and just keep getting away with it
not this time you better go and get sewing kit bitch
finish this stitch so you can reap what you sow nitwit
thought some time had past and i forget it forget it
you left our family in shambles
you expect me to just get over him pretend he never existed
maybe gone but hes not forgotten
and dont think cause hes been out the pictures so long
that ive stopped the plottin and still aint coming to get ya
youre wrong and that shit was rotten
and the way you played him same shit you did to me cold
have you any idea the shit ive gone through
feelings i harbor all this pent up resentment i hold on to
not once you called to ask me how im doing
letters you dont respond to em
fuck it im coming to see you
and gee who better to talk to than you
the cause to my problems
my life is garbage and im bout to take it out on you
poof then im gone whoosh

i flee the scene like it was my last ride
you see right through
oh you had me pegged the first time
you cant see the truth
but its easier to justify
whats bad is good
and i hate to be the bad guy
i just hate to be the bad guy

ive been driving around your side of the town
like 9 frickin hours and 45 minutes now
finally i found your new address park in your drive
feel like i been waiting on this moment all of my life
and its now arrived and my mouth is full of saliva
my knife is out and im ducking on the side of your house
see its sad it came to this point
such a disappointment i had to make this appointment to come and see ya
but aint here for ya empathy i dont need your apology
or your friendship of sympathy its revenge that i seek
so i sneak vengefully and treat your bedroom window
like i reach my full potential i peeked
continue to peep still bent low
keep tapping the glass lightly then start to crescendo
sneak all the way round to the back porch
man door handles unlocked shouldnt be that easy to do this
you dont plan for intruders before hand
surprised to see me cat got your tongue
gag chloroform rag gag almost hacked up a lung
like you picked up an axe up and swung
stick to the core plan drag to the back of a trunk
by one of your fans irony spectacular huh
now whos a faggot you punk
and heres your bronco hat you can have that shit back cuz they suck
its just me you and the music now slim
i hope you hear it we are in a car right now
wait here comes my favorite lyric
im the bad guy who makes fun of people that die
and hey heres a sequel to my mathers lp
just to try to get people to buy
hows this for publicity stunt this should be fun
last album now cause after this youll be officially done
eminem killed by m and m
matthew mitchell bitch i even have your initials
i initially was gonna bury you next to my brother but fuck it
since youre in love with your city so much
i figured what the fuck the best place you could be buried alive is right here
two more exits town is quite near
i hope we dont get stopped no license i fear
that sirens i hear guess 90 on the freeway wasnt the brightest idea
as cops appear in my driver side mirror
help police
hope foxtrot gets an aerial shot of your burial plot
new plan stan
slim chauvinist pig drove in this big lincoln town car
well gotta go almost at the bridge haha big bro its for you
slim this is for him and frank ocean oh hope you can swim good
now say you hate homos again

i also represent anyone normally seen on the end of those jokes you invent
im the nightmare you fell asleep in and woke up still in
im your karma closing in with each stroke of a pen
perfect time to have some remorse to show for your sin
no its hopeless im the denial that youre hopelessly in
when they say all of this is approaching its end
but you refuse to believe that its over here we go all over again
backs to the wall i’m stacking up all them odds toilets clogged
yeah ‘cause i’m talking a lot of shit but i’m backing it all up
but in my head there’s a voice in the back and it hollas
after the track is demolished
i am your lack of a conscience
i’m the ringing in your ears
i’m the polyps on the back of your tonsils
eating your vocal chords after your concerts
i’m your time that’s almost up that you haven’t acknowledged
grab for some water but i’m that pill that’s too jagged to swallow
i’m the bullies you hate that you became
with every faggot you slaughtered
coming back on you every woman you insult
there with the double-standards you have when it comes to your daughters
i represent everything you take for granted
‘cause marshall mather’s the rapper’s persona’s half a facade and 
matthew and stan’s just symbolic of you not knowing what you had til it’s gone
‘cause after all the glitz and the glam no more fans that are calling your name
cameras are off sad but it happens to all of them
i am hindsight to say “i told you so”
foreshadows of all things that are to follow
im the future the tv show that happens tomorrow
if you don’t stop after they call you
the biggest laughing stock of rap who can’t call it quits
but it’s time to walk away
i’m every guilt trip the baggage you had
but as you gather up all your possessions
if theres anything you have left to say
unless it makes an impact dont bother
so before you rest your case
better make sure youre packing a wallop
so one last time i’m back
before it fades into black and it’s all over
behold the final chapter in the saga
trying to recapture that lightning trapped in a bottle
twice the magic that started it all
tragic portrait of an artist tortured
trapped in his own drawings
tap into thoughts
blacker and darker than anything imaginable
here goes a wild stab in the dark
as we pick up the last mathers’ last art
