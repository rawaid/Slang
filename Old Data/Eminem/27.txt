lately ive been hard to reach ive been too long on my own
everybody has a private world where they can be alone
are you calling me are you trying to get through
are you reaching out for me im reaching out for you

im just so fuckin depressed i just cant seem to get out this slump
if i could just get over this hump but i need something to pull me out this dump
i took my bruises took my lumps fell down and i got right back up
but i need that spark to get psyched back up in order for me to pick the mic back up

i dont know how or why or when i ended up in this position im in
im startin to feel distant again so i decided just to pick this pen
up and try to make an attempt to vent but i just cant admit
or come to grips with the fact that i may be done with rap i need a new outlet

and i know some shits so hard to swallow but i just cant sit back and wallow
in my own sorrow but i know one fact ill be one tough act to follow
one tough act to follow ill be one tough act to follow
here today gone tomorrow but youd have to walk a thousand miles

in my shoes just to see what its like to be me
ill be you lets trade shoes just to see what itd be like to
feel your pain you feel mine go inside each others minds
just to see what wed find look at shit through each others eyes

but dont let em say you aint beautiful oh
they can all get fucked just stay true to you
so dont let em say you aint beautiful oh
they can all get fucked just stay true to you so

i think im startin to lose my sense of humor everythings so tense and gloom i
almost feel like i gotta check the temperature of the room just as soon as i
walk in its like all eyes on me and so i try to avoid any eye contact
cause if i do that then it opens the door for conversation like i want that

im not lookin for extra attention i just wanna be just like you
blend in with the rest of the room maybe just point me to the closest restroom
i dont need no fuckin man servant tryin to follow me around and wipe my ass
laugh at every single joke i crack and half of em aint even funny like hah

marshall youre so funny man you should be a comedian goddamn
unfortunately i am i just hide behind the tears of a clown
so why dont you all sit down listen to the tale im about to tell
hell we dont gotta trade our shoes and you aint gotta walk no thousand miles

in my shoes just to see what its like to be me
ill be you lets trade shoes just to see what itd be like to
feel your pain you feel mine go inside each others minds
just to see what wed find look at shit through each others eyes

but dont let em say you aint beautiful oh
they can all get fucked just stay true to you
so dont let em say you aint beautiful oh
they can all get fucked just stay true to you so

nobody asked for life to deal us with these bullshit hands were dealt
we gotta take these cards ourselves and flip em dont expect no help
now i could have either just sat on my ass and pissed an moaned
or take this situation in which im placed in and get up and get my own

i was never the type of kid to wait by the door and pack his bags
or sat on the porch and hoped and prayed for a dad to show up who never did
i just wanted to fit in in every single place every school i went
i dreamed of being that cool kid even if it meant actin stupid

aunt edna always told me keep makin that face itll get stuck like that
meanwhile im just standin there holdin my tongue tryin to talk like this
till i stuck my tongue on that frozen stop sign pole at 8 years old
i learned my lesson then cause i wasnt tryin to impress my friends no more

but i already told you my whole life story not just based on my description
cause where you see it from where your sittin its probably 110% different
i guess we would have to walk a mile in each others shoes at least
what size you wear i wear 10s lets see if you can fit your feet

in my shoes just to see what its like to be me
ill be you lets trade shoes just to see what itd be like to
feel your pain you feel mine go inside each others minds
just to see what wed find look at shit through each others eyes

but dont let em say you aint beautiful oh
they can all get fucked just stay true to you
so dont let em say you aint beautiful oh
they can all get fucked just stay true to you so

lately ive been hard to reach ive been too long on my own oh
everybody has their private world where they can be alone so
are you calling me are you trying to get through oh
are you reaching out for me im reaching out for you so

spoken
