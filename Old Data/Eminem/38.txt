you used to say that id never be
nothing without you and id believe
im shot in the lungs i gasp i cant breathe
just lay here with me baby hold me please

and id beg and id plead drop to knees
and id cry and id scream baby please dont leave
snatch the keys from your hand i would squeeze and youd laugh
and youd tease youre just fucking with me

and you must hate me
why do you date me if you say i make you sick
and youve had enough of me
i smother you im bout to jump off the edge

but you wont break me youll just make me
stronger than i was
before i met you i bet you ill be just
fine without you

and if i stumble i wont crumble
ill get back up and uhhh
but ima still be humble when i scream fuck you
cause im stronger than i was

a beautiful face is all that you had
cause on the inside youre ugly n mad
but youre all that i love i grasp you cant leave
please stay here with me baby hold me please

and id beg and i plead drop to knees
and id cry and id scream baby please dont leave
cause you left and you took everything i had left
and left nothing nothing for me

so please dont wake me from this dream baby
were still together in my head
and youre still in love with me
till i woke up to discover that that dream was dead

but you wont break me youll just make me
stronger than i was
before i let you i bet you ill be just
fine without you

and if i stumble i wont crumble
ill get back up and uhhh
and ima still be humble when i scream fuck you
cause im stronger than i was

you walked out i almost died
it was almost a homicide that you caused cause i was so traumatized

felt like i was in for a long bus ride
id rather die than you not be by my side
cant count how many times i vomited cried
go to my room turn the radio on and hide uh

we were bonnie and clyde
no on the inside you were jekyll and hyde i
felt like my whole relationship with you was a lie
it was you and i why did i think it was ride or die

cause if you couldve took my life you wouldve
its like you put a knife to my chest and pushed it right through to the
other side of my back and stuck a spike too shouldve
put up more of a fight but i couldnt at the time no one could hurt me like you couldve

take you back now whats the likelihood of that bite me bitch chew on a 19 footer
cause this morning i finally stood up
held my chin up finally showed a sign of life in me for the
first time since you left me and left me with nothing but shattered dreams and a life we couldve

had and we couldve been
but im breaking out of this slump im in
pulling myself out of the dumps once again
im getting up once and for all fuck this shit

imma be late for the pity party
but youre never gonna beat me to the fucking punch again
took it on the chin like a champ so dont lump me in with the chumpy ends
im done being your punching bag

it was the november 31st today wouldve been our anniversary
two years but you left on the first of may
i wrote it on the calender was gonna call but couldnt think of the words to say
but it came to me just now so i put em in a verse to lay

and i thank you cause you made me a better person than i was
but i hate you cause you drained me
i gave you all you gave me none

but if you blame me youre crazy
and after all thats said and done
im still angry yeah i may be
i may never trust someone

but you wont break me youll just make me
stronger than i was
before i met you i bet you ill be just
fine without you

and if i stumble i wont crumble
ill get back up and uhhh
and ima still be humble when i scream fuck you
cause im stronger than i was
