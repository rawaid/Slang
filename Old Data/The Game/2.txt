50 cent
yeah lets take em back
uh-huh

comin up i was confused my mommy kissin a girl
confusion occurs comin up in the cold world
daddy aint around probably out commitin felonies
my favorite rapper used to sing check check out my melody
i wanna live good so shit i sell dope
for a four finger ring one of them gold ropes
nana told me if i passed id get a sheepskin coat
i can move a few packs id get the hat now thatd be dope
tossed and turned in my sleep that night
woke up the next mornin niggaz had stole my bike
different day same shit aint nothin good in the hood
id run away from this bitch and never come back if i could

chorus 2x 50 cent + the game
hate it or love it the underdogs on top
and im gon shine homey until my heart stop
go head envy me im raps mvp
and i aint goin nowhere so you can get to know me

the game
i told dre from the gate id carry the heat for ya
first mix tape song i inherited beef for ya
gritted my teeth for ya g-g-g-gunit for ya
put compton on my back when you was in need of soldiers
at my last show i threw away my gold
and then i had the whole crowd yellin free yayo
so niggaz better get up outta mine
for i creep and turn your projects into columbine
and im raps mvp
dont make me remind yall what happened in dc
this nigga aint got it he pretend
mad at us cause ashanti got a new boyfriend
and it seems your lil rat turned out to be a mouse
beef shit is for the birds and the birds fly south
even young buck can vouch
when the doubts was out who gave the west coast mouth-to-mouth

chorus 2x 50 cent + lloyd banks
hate it or love it the underdogs on top
and im gon shine homey until my heart stop
go head envy me im raps mvp
and i aint goin nowhere so you can get to know me

50 cent
from the beginnin to the end
losers lose winners win
this is real we aint got to pretend
a cold world that we in is full of pressure and pain
i thought it would change its stayin the same

lloyd banks
how many of them boys was wit ya
when you had that little tv you had to hit on to get a picture
im walking with a snub
cause niggaz do a lot of slick talkin in the club til they coughin on
the rug
aint never had much but a walkman and a bud
my role model is gone snortin up his drug
bad enough they want me to choke my boy
just got poked in the throat
now its a r&amp;b shirt in my coat 
now im speedin reminiscin
holdin my weed here never listen
if i see him ima lift em
maybe that will even the score
if not itll be me on the floor

chorus 2x 50 cent + tony yayo
hate it or love it the underdogs on top
and im gon shine homey until my heart stop
go head envy me im raps mvp
and i aint goin nowhere so you can get to know me

tony yayo
i started out at 15 scared as hell
i took 30 off a pack and made them sales
as a youth man i used to hustle for loot
with that lil deuce-deuce and my triple fat goose
sippin easy jesus rockin a leases
my momma whipped me when she found my pieces
i look back on life thank god im blessed
we the best on the planet so forget the rest

young buck
you know im still nice with my cook game
look mane its a hood thang
thats why im loved in brooklyn
i handle mine just like a real nigga should
and if i do some time homey im still all good
let me show you what a thug bout born to die
i took the bullets outta 50 and put em in my 45
and i aint even got my feet wet yet
a seven figga nigga who aint seen tha heart to change

chorus 2x 50 cent + young buck
hate it or love it the underdogs on top
and im gon shine homey until my heart stop
go head envy me im raps mvp
and i aint goin nowhere so you can get to know me
