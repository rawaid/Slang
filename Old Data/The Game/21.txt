put youre lighters up if you want to

pull youre muthafuckin dodger caps over youre muthafuckin eyes
till you cant see shit
i want you to go blind nigga
so you can feel how i felt when i was in that muthafuckin coma

[chorus]
raised in the city of angels
where safe and danger switch lanes
so strenger drive slow drive slow
where beggers and gangstas
fast women and dank are
just part of the face that we show
we got mountains and ocean
we move in slow motion
off that sticky that you all love to blow
i swear aint nothing better there
thats why we all take our hats off to you the one blood

[verse 1]
come to my hood hood

or my niggas take you up out of your shine

[chorus]
raised in the city of angels
where safe and danger switch lanes
so stranger drive slow drive slow
where beggers and gangstas
fast women and dank are
just part of the face that we show
we got mountains and ocean
we move in slow motion
off that sticky that you all love to blow
i swear aint nothing better there
thats why we all take our hats off to you the one blood

[verse 2]
