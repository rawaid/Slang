verse 1 the game

june 30th 1107 i got that call
she 8 centimeters my lil man about to fall
scuffing my air forces running through the hospital hall
deja vu like i been here before
im feeling reborn like a bed-stuy brethren my first born
dre im about to have a bad boy family in the lobby
see my nigga church what up shit i left the camcorder in the truck
running through the maternity ward out of breath sweating
i swear to god every minutes starting to feel like a second
i seen hell staring down the barrel of a smith &amp; wesson
my sons ultrasound the closest i ever been to heaven
lord forgive me for my sins i know its last minute
put the chronic in the air a little hash in it
spread my wings if only i could fly
why fight to live homie if we only living to die

chorus busta rhymes

i hope you grow up to become that everything you can be
thats all i wanted for you youngn like father like son

but in the end i hope you only turn out better than me
i hope you know i love you youngn like father like son

my little man your day is coming coming your day is coming i tell you
and when it comes just keep it running running just keep it running i tell you

verse 2 the game

they say every time somebody die a child is born
so i thank the nigga who gave his life for the birth of my son
1132 she screaming at the top of her lungs
im panicking nurse yelling for the doctor to come
all i could remember was lamaze class breathe baby
one one two two three three four four i see the head
doc busting through the door he between the legs
he see the head its my baby boy
1146 the head out she screaming making crazy noise
pain is love my stomach folding like a la-z-boy
im feeling like mariah carey all these butterflys
voices singing to me sound like teena marie
im calling niggas on tour jayo tell spiz i just cut the umbilical cord
1157 a soldier is born and hes flesh of my flesh young harlem karan

chorus busta rhymes

i hope you grow up to become that everything you can be
thats all i wanted for you youngn like father like son

and when it comes just keep it running running just keep it running i tell you

verse 3 the game

i wanna thank dr af and nurse theresa for bringing my baby boy to life
you birthed a caesar and my baby mama aliska
for pushing out a 10-pound 4-ounce mini-me i still cant believe it
nose ears eyes chin just like your daddy
i die before you grow up and be just like your daddy or your grandfather
call uncle zip tell him i got a son and i aint even in harlem
im popping cris with your godfathers baron davis and d-mack darius rogers
drop the top on the 71 with my face in the clouds lord spare my son
and watch over aaron wright tyan and lil pun
lowriding banging ready to die track number 1
if i bust 5 times and they never see the sun
my life is a black hole like the barrel of a gun one

chorus busta rhymes

i hope you grow up to become that everything you can be
thats all i wanted for you youngn like father like son

but in the end i hope you only turn out better than me
i hope you know i love you youngn like father like son

my little man your day is coming coming your day is coming i tell you
and when it comes just keep it running running just keep it running i tell you

i hope you grow up to become that everything you can be
thats all i wanted for you youngn like father like son

but in the end i hope you only turn out better than me
i hope you know i love you youngn like father like son

my little man your day is coming coming your day is coming i tell you
and when it comes just keep it running running just keep it running i tell you
