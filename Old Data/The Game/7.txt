walked through the gates of hell see my impala parked in front
with the high beams on
me and the devil sharing chronic blunts
listening to the chronic album playin backwards
shootin at pictures of don imus for target practice
my mind fucked up so i cover it with a raider hood
im from the city that made you motherfuckers afraid of suge
made my grandmother pray for good
it never made her happy but i bet that new mercedes could
aint no bars but niggas cant escape the hood
they took so many of my niggas that i should hate the hood
but its real niggas like me that make the hood
ridin slow in that phantom just the way i should
with the top back and my sox hat
im paid in full the nigga alpo couldnt stop that
even if they brought the nigga pac back
id still keep this motherfucker cocked back

lil wayne
and im grindin until im tired

like what the hell am i doing right

my life my life my life my life
my life my life my life my life
my life my life my life my life
