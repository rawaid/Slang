[game - verse 1]
throw your motherfucking cincinnati hats in the sky
nigga dont ask why
red laces in and out of them air max 95s
i walk on the moon flow hotter than june
any nigga want drama i kick up a sand dune
peace to my man tune for giving his man room
now we hitting switches to the spring break cancun
get it naw forget it suuwoo i live it
made the letter b more famous than a red sox fitted
but that was suicide i dont live in judahs eyes
half of these rappers wasnt trapping when i was chopping the do or die
suge had me in i went puffy like zab judah eye
dre called told my baby momma wont you decide
she chose doc first day i poured you aside like its aftermath for life
and all i do is ride
before i turn on him i kill satan and stick my red flag in the ground
its red nation

[chorus - lil wayne]
now blood the fuck up
everydays a gamble motherfucker tough luck
and we going to fuck the world till that bitch bust nuts
i cant tell you whats good but i can tell you whats what
and thats bs up hoes down
looking in the mirror im nowhere to be found
blood im a dog call me a blood hound
throwing blood in the air leave blood on the ground

[verse 2 - game]
niggasll trade they soul to be drake or j cole

[chorus]

[verse 3 - game]
russia got a red flag
us got red stripes
last train to paris around the world in these red nikes
che guevara of the new era test me
louisville slugger youll get buried in my new era
got that natti on tighter than a magnum
walk in the club sagging with a 38 magnum
red ralph laurens the double r sitting on a hill like lauren
her and the car foreign
got my red dre beats on trying to put my peeps on
and i keep it hood like this phantom is a nissan
where my nigga jim jones at
roll up the weed son
so many bloods in compton had to get a nyc song
and while im out here i might as well go shopping
and put this new bad bitch i got her some red bottoms
and all these hating ass niggas want me dead
because im malcolm x before he turned muslim red

[chorus]
