chorus
got to live for today cause tomorrow aint promised to me
dont just want a piece i want my whole destiny
if you got it
im gone take it
if youre in it
youre coming with me
bench warmers
get no playing time
no sleeping
till i cross the line
im runnin

the game
with 99 miles left on the avis rental car
blowing horns like miles davis at the pearly gate
god let me in
give me a room by aaliyah with espn
i know i got more sins than two lesbians
been back and forth across the border like mexicans
but im runnin like new york pedestrians
trying not to scuff my nike air checks again
its funny how niggaz be the best of friends
and fall out over pussy and wanna dead they man
one of my niggaz in the grave the other one in the pin
she fuckin my enemies inside my homeboys benz
now she beggin gods mercy cause she aint listen to nas
and never heard about ike and the iverson jersey
he got a cousin named jason that rock the gary payton
now the same trifling bitch is a hiv patient
true story

chorus

tony yayo
if i get knocked with my gun nigga im runnin
if i catch a murder one nigga im runnin
homicide come around and they keep on coming
thats why im out of state and i keep on runnin
i aint nelly but my desert eagles on girl
just dropped bail traveling the world
when i sign my deal i said fuck jail
i went on tour to barcelona and brazil
this shit real fuck an appeal
ds want my head like that bitch in kill bill
sling dope sling crack and them e pills
thats why im on the low like a dead navy seals
im runnin

chorus

game
cause i gotta pack them shows
and dre told me aint no coming back from go
so i gotta get my album in place
my g-unit features
my eminem sixteens
my dr dre beats
and it was two years from today when i started rhyming
and took my demo to suge and he aint sign me
niggaz threatening my life like its hard to find me
see me shining in the hood like twenty inch lexanis
my mom said im hard head
i dont follow the rules
why should i when reebok giving niggaz they own shoes
and im dealing with the same problems 50 cent got
yayo in jail and they think im trying to take his spot
im in the studio laughing at chris rock
then i turn on mtv and see soulja slim shot
and niggaz trying to gun me down in the rim shop
cause i just want the same recognition that the crypts got
they say im the next in line and if i get shot
then i go out as the bobby fischer of hip hop
make yo chest move
sylvia rome and kevin lyle slept cool
jimmy iovine was the best move
