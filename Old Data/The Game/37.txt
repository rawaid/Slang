money for the money [x2]

[verse 1]
kanye told me that jesus walks in 04
but i grew up around impalas and drug lords
welcome to los angeles palm trees and drug stores
all we know is rocks and presidents like mount rushmore
fuck the police they hop out and bust doors
i aint goin back to jail nigga that what i flush for
my money or my glock who do i trust more
i dont know its probably the one that i touch more
guess its the green cause paper motivate niggas
and my rolex races cause it hate niggas
i use to only sell 8s like that laker nigga
now im movin 24s like i play at the staples center
you might miss the game so nigga dont blink
my phantom stand out like frank lucas mink
so go ahead and think like frank lucas think
somebodyll find your brains on the fuckin kitchen sink about

[chorus]
