verse 1
pull the rag off the six-fo
hit the switch show niggas how the shit go
the game is back the aftermath chain is gone
the ds is chrome the frame is black
so watch it lift up
till the motherf**ker bounce and break
and knock both of the screws out the licence plate
let the games begin
these other rap niggas so far behind they can taste my rims
shit let the chronic burn as the daytons spin
it aint been this much drama since i first heard eminem
in the club poppin x pills like m &amp; ms
call it dre day we celebratin bitch bring a friend
bottles on me tell the waiter to order another round
and put that cheap-ass hypnotic down
put your cris up
if you feel the same way
who got em hittin switches ny to la

hook
if i could fit the whole hood in the club
hop in the low-rider long as it got bitches in the back
i turn it into a strip-club
call it a lap-dance when the six-fo bounce that ass
if i could fit the hole world in the club
tell the dj to bang my shit the west-coast in this bitch
pop bottles and twist up
roll up chronic and hash
in a blunt call it aftermath

verse 2
somebody tell me where the drinks at
where the bitches at
you f**king on the first night meet me in the back
i got a pound of chronic and a gang of freaks
move bitch who the f**k you think they came to see

thats - my gangsta bitch and like crips and bloods
im in the club on some gangsta shit
so nigga twist up
light another dub 
bitches get scared when niggas start fighting in the club

i f**k a different bitch seven days a week
hit the switch watch it bounce like a scott storch beat

hook
if i could fit the whole hood in the club
hop in the low-rider long as it got bitches in the back
i turn it into a strip-club
call it a lap-dance when the six-fo bounce that ass
if i could fit the hole world in the club
tell the dj to bang my shit the west-coast in this bitch
pop bottles and twist up
roll up chronic and hash
in a blunt call it aftermath

verse 3

you passed me the torch i lit the chronic with it now the world is my ashtray
ridin three-wheel motion till the ass scrapes
turn sunset into a motherf**king drag-race

hit the switch let it bounce till the police shut the shit down
{when you hit the club

motherf**ker you would say i was the new dre
same impala different spokes
same chronic just a different smoke

hook

hop in the low-rider long as it got bitches in the back
i turn it into a strip-club
call it a lap-dance when the six-fo bounce that ass
if i could fit the hole world in the club
tell the dj to bang my shit the west-coast in this bitch
pop bottles and twist up
roll up chronic and hash
in a blunt call it aftermath
