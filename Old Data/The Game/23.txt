boy talks to lady to start the song

verse 1 - game dre
what happened in hip hop
that got pac and big shot
the thicks plots
now every rapper claim
he let his clique pop
but even myself tote a gun
and know to run then get shot
ive been there before
now im fuckin with doc
gotta do them calvin broadus numbers
if not i push rocks
anticipatin my encarceration
media think im fakin like mason
but when it comes to mase
fuck off kelly i dont take it in the face
i find out who sprayed it
im putting you under the pavement
no buddhist priest catholic or baptist pastor can save him
im far from religious
but i got beliefs so i put
cannary yellow diamonds
in my jesus piece
i came back from the dead
without a part of my chest
layed in a hospital bed on cardiac arrest
i waited for 3 years
while everybody else dropped
now i understand why nas
did a song with his pops

chorus x2

im ready to die
without a reasonable doubt
smoke chronic and hit it
doggy style before i go out
until they sign my death certificate
all eyez on me
im still at it illmatic
and thats the documentary

verse 2

if i die my niggas fuck it
i did a song with mary blige my niggas
got a hook from faith
no verse from jay
i guess on westside story
he thought i spit in his face
told ed lover and money luv
i was talkin to ja
with that mayback line
it was payback time
keep fuckin with me nigga
ill put you under me
take your car and trade it in
for eight 3 hundred cs
if you cross my t
ill dot your eyes
you do life in a cementary
ill do mine with shyne
come home sit in the thrown
with my legs crossed
and my air force
middle finger up
fuck the world
cause im feelin like puff
when life after death hit
mo money mo problems
and i lost my best friend
im the second dopest nigga
from compton ull ever hear
the first nigga only put out albums
every 7 years haha

game commentator
you know what speakin of jay
that just makes me roll down
now your song westside story
ohh ohh
you got a line that says
dont wear throwbacks
or drive ride in maybacks
is that a shot at jay
naa i was talkin about ja rule
yeah so yeah i got a lot of
respect for jay
you know what im saying
i never take shots at legends
thats just something i dont do

verse 3 - game busta
let me tell you why i do this shit
im a son of a gun
cause moms was a hoover crip
first day i got signed
i had to prove i spit
freestyle with busta rhymes
son duke is sick
the prodigee of doc dre
i could finally put the shoes on
now that the rumors of rakim and q gone
they say truth hurts
sunk like quick sand
dont stop me in traffic
and ask about hitman
i gotta restore the feelin
it crawled from under the rock
after the dog pound
crushed the buildings
i got a family to feed
im the middle of 9 children
we can talk about a loan
after i sell 5 million
if i tell you i aint game
and i dont know dre
you gonn do me like x-zibit
and cut half of my face
i take all the credit
for putting the west
back on the map
if you aint feelin that
guess im gorilla black

chorus x1

im ready to die
without a reasonable doubt
smoke chronic and hit it
doggy style before i go out
until they sign my death certificate
all eyez on me
im still at it illmatic
and thats the documentary
