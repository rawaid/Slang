background music i brought i brought i brought dreams dreams dreams i brought you all my dreams cuz i love you i love you i love you repeated throughout song

verse 1

i woke up out that coma 2001
bout the same time dre dropped 2001
three years later the album is done
aftermath presents nigga with a attitudeÂ  volume 1
rap critics politicin
wanna know the outcome
ready to die reasonable doubt and doggystyle in one
i feel like pac after the snoop dogg trial was done
dre behind that g-series and all eyez on me
i watched the death of a dynasty
so i told vibe magazine
workin with drdre was a dream
i had visions of makin a classic
then my world turned black like i was starin outta stevie wonders glasses
its kinda hard to imagine like kanye west
comin back from his fatal accident to beat makin and rappin but
we da future
whitney houston told me that its gon take more than a bullet in the heart to hold me back

hook

blushin in this 40 ounce
lettin the ink from my pen bleed
cuz martin luther king had a *dream*
aaliyah had a *dream*
left eye had a *dream*
so i reached out to kanye and *i brought you all my dreams*

verse 2

i had dreams of fuckin an rnb bitch like mya
when i saw that ass on the front of that king
read the article in the magazine
she loved gangstas loved nasty things
so im in the glass house havin nasty dreams
good girls never give it up
but anything is possible if 50 fucked vivica
hurdled lifes obstacles found my way through the maze
then joy turned to pain like frankie beverly and maze
used to dream of bein unsigned hype
till i was crushed my dave mays almost let my pen fall asleep on the page
daydreamin yesterday
dozin off back-stage
i tought i saw eazy talkin to jam master jay
so i walked over heard jam master say
its a hard-knock life then you pass away
they say sleep is the cousin of death
sow my eyes wide open cuz a dream is kin to your last breath

hook

blushin in this 40 ounce
lettin the ink from my pen bleed
cuz martin luther king had a *dream*
aaliyah had a *dream*
left eye had a *dream*
so i reached out to kanye and *i brought you all my dreams*

verse 3

the dream of huey newton thats what im livin through
the dream of eric wright thats what imi givin you
who walked through the white house without a business suit
compton had jheri curl drippin on ronald reagans shoes
gave mike lim my demo came here to pay my dues
started off with whoo-kid then i started blazin clue
it was all a dream like big said it be
dont sleep on me homie i bring nightmares to reality
rap phenomenon defyin the rules of gravity
studied all the classic started revisin my strategy
cuz marshall mathers made it
curtis jackson made it
head in the clouds wonderin where the hell marvin gaye went
how do i say this im livin for my son but i cant figure out why im at my temple with this gun
wake up to a jesus piece like a catholic nun
the war to be a rap legend ha just begun

hook
blushin in this 40 ounce
lettin the ink from my pen bleed
cuz martin luther king had a *dream*
aaliyah had a *dream*
left eye had a *dream*
so i reached out to kanye and *i brought you all my dreams*
