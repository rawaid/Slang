verse 1
to all my niggas on the porch getting their hair braided
corn rolled by a la bitch
and i cant forget
my niggas riding the train yankee fitted
thermals under that pelle shit
i love new york but gangbanging thats la shit
and im proud of it
spit it through the wire so the crowd love it
haters you know who you are you can turn it down fuck it
i can shoot a video to it and spend half the budget
im gangsta let the 40 cal blow in public
more hatred inside my soul than pac had for delores tucker
every time one of my niggas get shot the more i suffer
cause we trapped inside a world where your forced to die for your colors
i seen it all through the range tints
got niggas doing life in the state pen
so i dread like jamaicans
if i die for one of my statements
than break up the streets of compton and spill my blood in the pavement

hook

talking that shit like they goin lay me down
and then i come through strapped to see whats up
niggas really dont know parts of me pal

the head honcho staring out the third story window
of my beverly hills condo
with two long ass heats

and when i come through strapped to see whats up
niggas really dont know parts of me pal
