intro
3 minutes my niggayall know what it isjust blaze

verse 1
gangsta gangsta thats already evident
nigga wit a attitude check check my residence
whether im crip or blood homie thats irrelivant
im with the d-o-c theres nobody better then the west coast felon when he on that lowrider
bike pedaling somebody tell eazy they still yellin it
im with ya homie doc dre on the television while these niggas moving peanuts like a elephant
im on cars like spinnin rims
im in a class all by myself like the brown eminem
not to down eminem i fuck black bitches fuck white bitches nigga i like bitches
them half and half alicia keys dyke bitches
if the head right i might air nike bitches
or put em on a track like just blaze i look down on hoes and look up to dre cause aint

chorus
no more fun and games
scratches and mix-ins

verse 2
im like dre eazy cube king tia rolled into one
used to move birdies till i put a hole in one
nigga they thought i wasnt holdin a gun they try to ride up on me like afeni shakurs only son
dre told me he aint doing detox this his only run
mase coming back and hovie done
im surrounded by legends sitting at the round table i am the game and still niggas tryna play
dude
im ruthless i aint talkin bout the label
i hook niggas up and i dont mean free cable
i mean i hook niggas up to the iv the same way dre hooked me up to ivine
im from the gutter grew up in public housing
on the same block with a shack like yao ming
so if a nigga ever try to jerry hellin me tell dre put up a mill cause thats what my bail
will be

chorus
no more fun and games
scratches and mix-ins

verse 3
i been rapping for 1 year 1 month 17 days
13 hours 28 minutes then i met dre
30 minutes after i bought the new em that was november 18 309 pm
around the same time wanksta got its first spin that was 32 weeks before they signed rakim
8 months 13 days before i knew a mike lynn
and 3 years after mase done turned his mic in
i start writing 22 months and 20 weeks prior to lebron shaking adidas for nikes
im right here 6 years after randy moss caught his first touchdown for the vikings
1 day 7 hours 14 minutes 21 seconds before soundscan got printed
2 platinum records for im classified with biggie
and 2 seconds before the song finish yeah
