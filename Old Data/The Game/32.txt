inside the lambo shotgun with snoop
what would the mothafuckin west coast be without one crip and

hook

verse 2
im from the west side of the 64 impala

everybody know that im the heir to the aftermath dynasty
and i aint gotta make shit for the club

when the chronic smoke clear all you gon see is

niggas stepped on my fingers and i climbed right back to the top
