leave the angels in the city
leave the angels in the city

[verse 1]
tell them muthaf-ckas im forever paid
california king wrestle gators in the everglades
drive up out that muthaf-ckin swamp in the escalade
so before you put that red rag in your pocket i wanna see your f-ckin resume
started off on ground zero then i start to levitate
rip rappers a new asshole i never hesitate
dre beats on smoking that chronic just to meditate
ima give em hurricanes until another levee break
you niggas is featherweight im aftermaths heavyweight
now dres weapon of mass destruction is bout to detonate
when a nigga wack found me shit i was selling weight
now a niggas selling millions now its time to celebrate
performing in front of millions nigga every race
64 in the 64 now watch the chevy scrape
4th album no 5 mics then let em hate
but im not stopping til im the f-cking king in every state

[hook kendrick lamar]
recognize my life ridicule my fight
give me fuel for the fire burning when i yearn these lights
in the midst of the hieroglyphs my fingertips start to write
get familiar with cartwright
cause i wrote that shot im a raging bull when the needle drops
for the record imm wreck it even if my record dont pop
imma tie your knot on a downtown building let it tow behind me
tell em they can find me in the dark with the ghetto children look at my heart
nigga f-ck your feelings this is me

[verse 2]
im sick of muthaf-ckers talking about the west died
cant you hear my heart beating
thats the motherf-ckin west side you test me you test god
im his son insane songs you come at me
then i can split you with this tommy gun
you wont have no time to run
im from the compton slums and thats how the west ride
im from the city where 2 of the best died
rest in peace to both of em spit like im the ghost of em
damn i said i spit like im the ghost of em
name your top 10 im harder than the most of em
matter of fact shorten your list nigga top 5
game biggie hov prolly pac nas no particular order

how dare you niggas pop fly
when im the nigga sold 5 mil out the gate and numbers do not lie

[hook]

[verse 3]
i gave you the documentary shit was a classic
gave you doctors advocate you ripped it out the package
came with lax since critics said it was average
i was stressed the f-ck out torn between aftermath and
geffen interscope now i got you in the scope
spill the red ink on the paper its like my pen is broke
and this is what you all been waiting for
im the lost angel knocking on satans door
what the f-ck yall take me for i love you cause you hate me more
im kobe on the lakers floor except i give you 84
shake you like haitis floor walk up on you
like whats going on baby boy shots in that mercedes door
either im crazy or the black slim shady or
could that be the reason that baby said he would pay me more
but i still owe jimmy one more album
the best the west has ever seen no disrespect to calvin

[hook]

[verse 4 kendrick lamar]
kendrick and i wear pendant on my shoulder soldier
like a lieutenant and the coupe tinted got pulled over
johnny always lock a nigga down
knowing damn well we dont wanna see the box like manny pacquiao
little nigga mayweather size ride like pac in his prime
thug life is now on radar
til the federal come through and raid ours
reminiscing when the la raiders
was in my home snapback fitted on my uncles dome
and i dont condone dickriding
im addicted to westsiding
living in a city where the skinny niggas die
and the semi bullets fly but it turn me to a lion
trying and i mean that shit
game came through put the city on his back
i was in the city with a nigga had seen that shit
compton a nigga gotta scream that shit
never went commercial never tv screened that shit
cant block or screen that shit now everybody sing that shit

[outro]
red is a very emotionally intense colour
it enhances human metabolism increases respiration rate and raises blood pressure
it has a very high visibility it is why stop signs stop lights and fire equipments are usually painted red
it also represents one third of californias gang population
needless to say please dress accordingly while visiting the los angeles area
also tuck your jewellry and keep your hands inside your vehicle
