the bigger the cat the bigger the pillin
come through something ill missin the ceilin
what influenced my raps stick ups and killins
kidnappins project buildins drug dealins
criticize that why is that
cause now rap is compared to legitimized crack
cause we love to talk on ass we gettin
most intellectuals will only half listen
so you cant blame jazz musicians
or david stern with his nba fashion issues
oh i think they like mein my white teeth
you cant ice me we here for life b
on my second marriage hip hops my first wifey
and for that we not takin it lightly
if hip hop should die we die together
bodies in the morgue lie together
all together now

everybody sound the same commercialize the game
reminiscin when it wasnt all business
if it got where it started
so we all gather here for the dearly departed
hip hopper since a toddler
one homeboy became a man then a mobster
if the guys let me get my last swig of vodka
rip well donate your lungs to a rasta
went from turntables to mp3s
from beat street to commercials on mickey ds
from gold cables to jacobs
from plain facials to botox and face lifts
im lookin over my shoulder
its about 80 peoples from my hood that showed up
and they came to show love
sold out concert and the doors are closed shut
