get-get get down

new york streets where killersll walk like pistol pete
and pappy mason gave the young boys admiration
prince from queens and fritz from harlem
street legends the drugs kept the hood from starvin
pushin cars nicky barnes was the 70s
but theres a long list of high-profile celebrities
worldwide on the thorough side of things
livest kings some died one guy one time
one day grabs me as im about to blast heat
40-side of vernon i turned well he asked me
whatchu up to the cops gon bust you
i was a teen drunk off brew stumbled i wondered
if god sent him cause two squad cars entered the block
and looked at us i aint flinch when they watched
i took it upstairs the bathroom mirror brushed my hair
starin at a young disciple i almost gave my life to what the dice do
yeah man throwin them bones
hopin my ace get his case thrown
his girl aint wait for him she in the world straight hoein
while he lookin at centerfolds of pretty girls
showin they little cooch gangstas dont die hes livin proof
the da who tried him was lyin
a white dude killed his mother durin the case
hung jury now the da is bein replaced
pre-trial hearin is over its real for the soldier
walks in the courtroom the look in his eyes is wild
triple-homicide i sit in the back aisle
i wanna crack a smile when i see him
throw up a fist for black power cause all we want is his freedom
he grabbed a court officers gun and started squeezin
then he grabbed the judge screams out - nobody leavin everybody

southern niggaz independent label real killers
know the business ran tennessee for years now they chillin
they had the coke game somethin crazy
sold music out the trunk of they car that shit amazed me
put me onto heron blunts sherm or somethin
took a puff what the fuck i turned to punch them
southern niggaz aint slow nigga tried to play me
i left from around them dudes they cool but they crazy
now im back around the old school that raised me
new york gangstas we loungin out in la see
a dude wrote my dawg from pelican bay
the letter say nas i got your back - the fools dont play
i rolled with some crips down to a crenshaw funeral
never saw so many men slaughtered and i knew the ho responsible
the nigga still alive in a hospital
midnight they crept in his room and shot the doctor too
see my cousins in the game thuggin and things
he plugged me with a dame who was half-mexicano
gave the ass up ima mack daddy soprano
she passed me the indigo but the imbecile
shoulda never tippy-toed thought my eyes were closed
openin the hotel room do to let her goons in
but i moved in a manner on some jet li shit
i let the hammers blow wet three kids
see honey thought i had somethin to do with all the drama
cause i was with a crew that had her people killed
called up my cousin told him i aint fuckin witchu
he responded cool but told me out here this how motherfuckers
