simultaneous making me climb higher heinous crimes behind me

every tat mean something thats my word on my body
ill have to lean something wit that mossberg shotty

verse 2
army jacket swag army jacket green and black
wit the square top pocket that snaps
where the gas at
pass that not you
you hold crack where your ass at
i never did that my sock where my stash was at
yo i use to listen to that red alert and rap attack
i fell in love with the poetry i mastered that
cuttin school with preme team at phat cat was at
future not crystal clear yet baccarat

now im the one thats reppin queens way beyond your wildest dreams
bottles on bottles with sparklers surround my team
that long cash get the baddest bitches out they jeans
20 years in this game lookin 17
i dont lean no codeine promethazine
i just blow green pick which a bitch can bless the king
although hes on to another chapter
heavy d gave this beat to salaam for me to rap to
blaaaah

worth more than the blood of a martyr
