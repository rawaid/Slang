[chorus]
da da da da da
da da da da da yeah
da da da da da
da da da da da yeah

it aint hard to tell i excel then prevail
the mic is contacted i attract clientele
my mic check is life or death breathin the snipers breath
i exhale the yellow smoke of buddha through righteous steps
deep like the shinin sparkle like a diamond
sneak a uzi on the island in my army jacket linin
hit the earth like a comet invasion
nas is like the afrocentric asian half-man half-amazin
cause in my physical i can express through song
delete stress like motrin then extend strong
i drank moet with medusa give her shotguns in hell
from the spliff that i lift and inhale it aint hard to tell

[chorus]

the buddha monks in your trunk turn the bass up
not stories by aesop place your loot up parties i shoot up
nasll analyze drop a jew-el inhale from the l
school a fool well you feel it like braille
it aint hard to tell i kick a skill like shaquille holds appeal
vocabulary spills im +ill+
plus +matic+ i freak beats slam it like iron shiek
jam like a tech with correct techniques
so analyze me surprise me but cant magmatize me
scannin while youre plannin ways to sabotage me
i leave em froze like her-on in your nose
nasll rock well it aint hard to tell

[chorus]

this rhythmatic explosion is what your frame of mind has chosen
ill leave your brain stimulated niggaz is frozen
speak with criminal slang begin like a violin
end like leviathan its deep well let me try again
wisdom be leakin out my grapefruit troop
i dominate break loops givin mics men-e-straul cycles
streets disciple i rock beats thats mega trifle
and groovy but smoother than moves by villanova
youre still a soldier im like sly stone in cobra
packin like a rasta in the weed spot
vocalsll squeeze glocks mcs eavesdrop
though they need not to sneak
my poetrys deep i never fell
nass raps should be locked in a cell
it aint hard to tell

[chorus]
