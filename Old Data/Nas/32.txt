[nas]
the golden child chop that ass up you was holding out
let the streets be the court - and corners hold the trial
fatal not fictitious
i rock the cable 86s foreign cars young with crazy bitches
mad smoke makes me able to quote
soliciting ill editions of that murder i wrote
a provocative plan can bring a knot to my hand
as the pyramids that stand on top of the sand
in the heat of the moment like farrakhan said we need atonement
bulletproof glass s-classes chrome kitted up
calicones lit it up
i didnt get touched checking my nuts i stood up and lit a dutch
clutching gats quick to bust
but knowing how these niggas tattle
i sneak move get the drop one shot without the gun battle
so when you run the lead travel
i come through its taboo
ninety-six ways made to clap you

chorus *unknown singers*

nas is coming nas is coming
nas is coming nasty nas is coming nas is coming
nas is coming nas is coming
nas is comin nasty nas is coming nas is coming

[nas]
in the black limo jack daniels through the cracked window
i spot the fake red dot his face like a hindu
snatched the symbol tied his hands too
make examples substantial amounts you owe to the fam
crew firm affiliation paper chasing
chips glossy rich pablo escabarno
sophisticado blazing hollows like saddles
rap apostle nacho cheese im castro
compared to these niggas who swear to be real
but impostors to hoffa nas plague kills
counting bills to send to all my jail niggas who fell
from new york to la qb to cpt for gp
a hundred g cars garcia vegas cigars kani shit mad jiggy
the clout murder material serial scratched out
my names passed out like its something venereal
but back in stereo

chorus

[nas]
from childbirth to hearses flow like the nile cover surface
i bit the fruit from the serpent
apocalyptic get bent stay spliffted
control the rap game you got it twisted
dr dre way the bridge say shake dice and kiss it
sip crist push the six with biscuit
jeep full of chickens pull up beside have a listen yall nas yall
fly gangster wavy hair teeth chipped in
my shit bump in the courtroom drunk links truck
rocky bracelet cognac kernel never chase it
rap hero black deniro
federal bureau tapped my line and got zero
rap pro diamond roll hustling low -
pro-file white gold style raking bloody dough by the pile
shot down still alive he struggling for the phone
44 blow him when homicide comes these three words are sung

chorus 2x
