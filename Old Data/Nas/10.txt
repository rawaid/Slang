verse one 

what up kid i know shit is rough doing your bid 
when the cops came you shoulda slid to my crib 
fuck it black no time for looking back its done 
plus congratulations you know you got a son 
i heard he looks like you why dont your lady write you 
told her she should visit thats when she got hyper 
flippin talkin about he acts too rough 
ge didnt listen he be riffing while im telling him stuff 
i was like yeah shorty dont care she a snake too 
fucking with them niggaz from that fake crew that hate you 
but yo guess who got shot in the dome-piece 
jeromes niece on her way home from jones beach its bugged 
plus little rob is selling drugs on the dime 
hanging out with young thugs that all carry 9s 
at night time its more trife than ever 
whattup with cormega did you see em are yall together 
if so then hold the fort down represent to the fullest 
say whassup to herb ice and bullet 
i left a half a hundred in your commissary 
you was my nigga when push came to shove 
one what one love 

verse two 

dear born youll be out soon stay strong 
out in new york the same shit is going on 
the crack-heads stalking loud-mouths is talking 
hold check out the story yesterday when i was walking 
the nigga you shot last year tried to appear like he hurting something 
word to mother i heard him fronting 
and he be pumping on your block your man gave him your glock 
and now they run together what up son whatever 
since im on the streets ima put it to a cease 
but i heard you blew a nigga with an ox for the phone piece 
wiling on the island but now with el mara 
better chill cos them niggaz will put that ass on fire 
last time you wrote you said they tried you in the showers 
but maintain when you come home the corners ours 
on the reals all these crab niggaz know the deal 
when we start the revolution all they probably do is squeal 
but chill see you on the next vi 
i gave your mom dukes loot for kicks plus sent your flicks 
your brothers buck wiling in four maine he wrote me 
he might beat his case til he come home i play it low key 
so stay civilized time flies though incarcerated your mind dies
i hate it when your moms cries 
it kinda wants to make me murder for real-a 
ive even got a mask and gloves to bust slugs but one love

verse three 

sometimes i sit back with a buddha sack 
minds in another world thinking how can we exist through the facts 
written in school text books bibles etcetera 
fuck a school lecture the lies get me vexed-er 
so i be ghost from my projects 
i take my pen and pad for the weekend hitting ls while im sleeping 
a two day stay you may say i needed time alone 
to relax my dome no phone left the 9 at home 
you see the streets have me stressed something terrible 
fucking with the corners have a nigga up in belle vue 
or hdm hit with numbers from 8 to 10 
a future in a maximum state pen is grim 
so i comes back home nobodys out but shorty doo-wop
rolling two phillies together in the bridge we call them oowops 
he said nas niggaz could be busting off the roof 
so i wear a bullet proof and pack a black tres-deuce 
he inhaled so deep shut his eyes like he was sleep 
started coughing when i peeked to watch me speak 
i sat back like the mack my army suit was black 
we was chilling on these benches where he pumped his loose cracks 
i took the l when he passed it this little bastard 
keeps me blasted and started talking mad shit 
i had to school him told him dont let niggaz fool him 
cause when the pistol blows the one thats murdered be the cool one
tough luck when niggaz are struck families fucked up 
couldve caught your man but didnt look when you bucked up 
mistakes happen so take heed never bust up 
at the crowd catch him solo make the right man bleed 
shortys laugh was cold blooded as he spoke so foul 
only twelve trying to tell me that he liked my style 
then i rose wiping the blunts ash from my clothes 
then froze only the blow the herb smoke through my nose 
and told my little man that im a go cyprose 
left some jewels in the skull that he can sell if he chose 
words of wisdom from nas try to rise up above 
keep an eye out for jake shorty im out one love
