[speaking softly gradually getting louder]
one time yeah yeah

yo all i need is one mic one beat one stage
one nigga front my face on the front page
only if i had one gun one girl and one crib
one god to show me how to do things his son did
pure like a cup of virgin blood; mixed with
151 one sipll make a nigga flip
writin names on my hollow tips plottin shit
mad violence who im gon body this hood politics
ackowledge it leave bodies chopped in garbages
seeds watch us grow up and try to follow us
police watch us {*siren*} roll up and try knockin us
one knee i ducked could it be my time is up
but my luck i got up the cop shot again
bus stop glass bursts a fiend drops his heineken
richochetin between the spots that im hidin in
blackin out as i shoot back fuck gettin hit [more sirens]
this is my hood ima rep to the death of it
til everybody come home little niggaz is grown
hoodrats dont abortion your womb we need more warriors soon
sip from the star sun and the moon
in this life of police chases street sweepers and coppers
stick-up kids with no conscience leavin victims with doctors
if you really think you ready to die with nines out
this is what nas is bout nigga the time is now

[whispering again]
yo all i need is one mic
all i need is one mic thats all i need
all i need is one mic all i need niggaz

[gradually getting louder]
all i need is one blunt one page and one pen
one prayer - tell god forgive for one sin
matter fact maybe more than one look back
at all the hatred against me fuck alla them
jesus died at age 33 theres thirty-three shots
from twin glocks theres sixteen apiece thats thirty-two
which means one of my guns was holdin 17
twenty-seven hit your crew six went into you
everybody gotta die sometime; hope your funeral
never gets shot up bullets tear through the innocent
nothin is fair niggaz roll up shootin from wheelchairs
my heart is racin tastin revenge in the air
i let the shit slide for too many years too many times
now im strapped with a couple of macs too many nines
if yall niggaz really wit me get busy load up the semis
do more than just hold it explode the clip until you empty
theres nothin in our way - they bust we bust they rust we rust
led flyin feel it i feel it in my gut
that we take these bitches to war lie em down
cause we stronger now my nigga the time is now

[whispering again]
all i need is one mic thats all i need thats all i need
all i need is one mic theres nuttin else in the world
all i need is one mic thats all a nigga need to do his thing yknow
all i need is one mic

[starting loud this time getting quieter]
all i need is one life one try one breath im one man
what i stand for speaks for itself they dont understand
or wanna see me on top too egotistical
talkin all that slick shit the same way these bitches do
wonder what my secrets is niggazll move on you
only if they know what your weakness is i have none
too late to grab guns im blastin cause im a cool nigga
thought i wouldnt have that ass done fooled you niggaz
what you call a infinite brawl eternal souls clashin
war gets deep some beef is everlastin
complete with thick scars brothers knifin each other
up in prison yards drama where does it start
you know the block was ill as a youngster
every night it was like a cop would get killed body found in the dumpster
for real a hustler purchased my range niggaz throwin dirt on my name
jealous cause fiends got they work and complain
bitches left me cause they thought i was finished
shoulda knew she wasnt true she came to me when her man caught a sentence
diamonds are blindin i never make the same mistakes
movin with a change of pace lighter load see now the king is straight
swellin my melon cause none of these niggaz real
heard he was tellin police how can a kingpin squeal
this is crazy im on the right track im finally found
you need some soul searchin the time is now

all i need is one mic yeah yeah yeah yeah
all i need is one mic thats all i ever needed in this world fuck cash
all i need is one mic fuck the cars the jewelry
all i need is one mic to spread my voice to the whole world
