i saw my daughter send a letter to some boy her age
who locked up first i regretted it then caught my rage like
how could i not protect her from this awful phase
never tried to hide who i was she was taught and raised like
a princess but while im on stage i cant leave her defenseless
plus shes seen me switching women pops was on some pimp shit
she heard stories of her daddy thuggin
so if her husband is a gangster cant be mad i love her
never for her i want better homie in jail- dead that
wait till he come home you can see where his heads at
niggas got game they be tryna live
he seen your mama crib plus im sure he know who your father is
although you real plus a honest kid
dont think im slow i know you probably had that chronic lit
you 17 i got a problem with it
she looked at me like im not the cleanest father figure but she rocking with it

this for niggas wit daughters

this morning i got a call nearly split my wig
this social network said nas go and get ya kid
shes on twitter i know she aint gon post no pic
of herself underdressed no inappropriate shit right
her mother cried when she answered
said she dont know what got inside this childs mind she planted
a box of condoms on her dresser then she instagrammed it
at this point i realized i aint the strictest parent
im too loose im too cool with her
shoulda drove on time to school with her
i thought i dropped enough jewels on her
took her from private school so she can get a balance
to public school they too nurture teen talents
they grow fast
one day shes ya little princess next day she talking boy business
what is this
they say the coolest playas and foulest heart breakers in the world
god gets us back he makes us have precious little girls

and i aint tryna mess ya thing up
but i just wanna see you dream up
i finally understand
it aint easy to raise a girl as a single man
nah the way mothers feel for they sons how fathers feel for they daughters
when he date he straight chip off his own papa
when she date we wait behind the door with the sawed off
cuz we think no one is good enough for our daughters
love
