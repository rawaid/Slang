jungle survivor fuck whos the liver
my man put the battery in my back a difference from energizer
sentence begins indented with formality
my durations infinite money wise or physiology
poetry thats a part of me retardedly bop
i drop the ancient manifested hip hop straight off the block
i reminisce on park jams my man was shot for his sheep coat
childhood lesson make me see him drop in my weed smoke 
its real grew up in trife life did times or white lines
the hype vice murderous night times and knife fights invite crimes
chill on the block with cognac hold strap

one for the money
two for pussy and foreign cars
three for aliz√© niggas deceased or behind bars
i rap divine god check the prognosis is it real or showbiz
my window faces shootouts drug overdoses
live amongst no roses only the drama for real
a nickel-plate is my fate my medicine is the ganja
heres my basis my razor embraces many faces
your telephone blown black stitches or fat shoelaces
peoples are petrol dramatic automatic 44 i let blow
and back down po-po when im vexed so
my pen taps the paper then my brains blank
i see dark streets hustling brothers who keep the same rank
pumping for something some will prosper some fail
judges hanging niggas incorrect bails for direct sales
my intellect prevails from a hanging cross with nails
i reinforce the frail with lyrics thats real
word to christ a disciple of streets trifle on beats
i decipher prophecies through a mic and say peace
i hung around the older crews while they sling smack to dingbats
they spoke of fat cat that niggas name made bell rings black
some fiends scream about supreme team a jamaica queens thing
uptown was alpo son heard he was kingpin yo
fuck rap is real watch the herbs stand still
never talking to snakes cause the words of man kill
true in the game as long as blood is blue in my veins
i pour my heineken brew to my deceased crew on memory lane
