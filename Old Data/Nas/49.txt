monopolize strategies of war exercise mega

peep the nine milli now undress you know the drill-y
niggaz suspect weak links pose threats i have yet
to met challenger who go against my set
gem stars razor sharp like gillette shaving closely on
any character approach me

while cat burglars trying to sneak peep the recipe
inside my rap cookbook paragraphs is gourmet

[havoc]

its only me and the gat thats holding me
we got it locked beyond measure the clicks under pressure
extort you for your treasure smack you with the undresser
represent your click go ahead get that ass whipped
floating in the river with your body wrapped in plastic
wannabe thug get smacked for back talking

while you rapping im busy tryna sneak the gat in
could tear men cut the party while you jamming

but you aint me you hesitated so i clapped you
then stepped off casually naturally me

[nas]
niggaz thinking shit sweet i carry big heat
wavy hair chipped teeth up in this bitch deep
queens murder clicks meet yellow tapes on black gates 
mediterranean projects is like kuwait
i escape into zones thats irregular
why debate on a phone im solar cellular
escobar 600 you just a crumb inside a world
where the rich run it curriculum of a mathologist
deep throats they try to swallow this
anthropologists dynasties of great knowledgists
i preserve in my dome niggas mics is full of silicone
spots blown guerilla ice on this killers life
i put my word on it
now you can sleep on or rock a swerve on it
nas is ménage à trois on mount aire lodges
we like a smooth fam but rougher than how debarge is
catching charges of marksmen living heartless
grab a cartridge cock my shit on some mobb shit
we mobbing putting niggas in mausoleums
put queens across the throggs neck heads bop i see em
