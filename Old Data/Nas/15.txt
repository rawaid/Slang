uh uh uh now lets get it all in perspective
for all yall enjoyment a song yall can step wit
yall appointed me to bring rap justice
but i aint five-o yall know its nas yo
grey goose and a whole lotta hydro
only describe us as soldier survivors
stay laced in the best well dressed with finesse
in a white tee lookin for wifie
thug girl who fly and talks so nicely
put her in the coupe so she can feel the nice breeze
we can drive thru the city no doubt 
but dont say my cars topless say the titties is out 
newness heres the anthem put your hand up 
that you shoot with count your loot wit
push the pool stick in your new crib 
same hand that you hoop with swing around like you stupid 
kinga the town yeah i been that
you know i click-clack where you and your mens at
do the smurf do the wop baseball bat
rooftop like we bringing 88 back

they shootin aw made you look
you a slave to a page in my rhyme book
gettin big money playboy your times up
where them gangstas where them dimes at

they shootin aw made you look
you a slave to a page in my rhyme book
gettin big money playboy your times up
where them gangstas at where them dimes at

this aint rappin this is street-hop
now get up off your ass like your seats hot
my live niggaz lit up the reefer
trunk at the car we got the street sweeper
dont start none wont be none no reason for your mans to panic
you dont wanna see no ambulances
knock a pimps drink down in his pimp cup
thats the way you get timberlandd up
let the music diffuse all attention
ball or convention free admission
hustlers dealers and killerscan move swift
girls get close youca feel where the tools kept
all my just-comin homies parolees
get money leave the beef alone slowly
get out my face you people so phoney
pull out my waist the eagle fo-forty

they shootin aw made you look
you a slave to a page in my rhyme book
gettin big money playboy your times up
where them gangstas where them dimes at

they shootin aw made you look
you a slave to a page in my rhyme book
gettin big money playboy your times up
where them gangstas at where them dimes at

is always the nastiest and i like a little sassiness 
a lotta class mommy reach in your bag pass the fifth
im a leader at last this a don you wit
