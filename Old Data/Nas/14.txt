nas is    -nas 7x

[nas]
freedom or jail clips inserted a babys bein born
same time a man is murdered the beginning and end
as far as rap go its only natural i explain
my plateau and also what defines my name
first it was nasty but times have changed
ask me now im the artist but hardcore my science for pain
i spent time in the game kept my mind on fame
saw fiends shoot up and do lines of cocaine
saw my close friends shot flatline am i sane
that depends carry mac-10s to practice my aim
on rooftops tape cd covers to trees
line the barrel up with your weak picture then squeeze
street scriptures for lost souls in the crossroads
to the corner thugs hustlin for cars that cost dough
to the big dogs livin large takin it light
pushin big toys gettin nice enjoyin your life
is what you make it suicide few try to take it
belt tied around they neck in jail cells naked
heaven and hell rap legend prescence is felt
and of course n - a - s are the letters that spell   
nas nas

chorus scratching by dj premier 2x

nas is like life or death my rep
my poetrys deep i never fell
nas is like half man half amazing
no doubt

[nas]
nas is like earth wind &amp; fire rims and tires
bulletproof glass inside is the realest driver
planets in orbit line em up with the stars
tarot cards you can see the pharaoh nas
nas is like iron mike messiah type
before the christ after the death
the last one left let my cash invest in stock
came a along way from blastin techs on blocks
went from seiko to rolex ownin acres
from the projects with no chips to large cake dough
dimes givin fellatio siete zeros
bet my nine spit for the pesos
but whats it all worth cant take it when you under this earth
rich men died and tried but none of it worked
they just rob your grave id rather be alive and paid
before my numbers called historys made
somell fall but i rise thug or die
makin choices that determine my future under the sky
to rob steal or kill im wondering why
its a dirty game is any man worthy of fame
much to success to ya even if you wish me the opposite
sooner or later well all see who the prophet is

chorus

[nas]
nas is like sex to a nympho but nothin sweet
im like beef bustin heat through your windows
im like a street sweeper greenleaf reaper
like greeks in egypt learnin somethin deep from they teachers
im like crime like your nine your man you would die for
always got you im like pac dude you would cry for
im like a whole lot of loot im like crisp money
corporate accounts from a rich company
im like ecstasy for ladies im like all races
combined in one man; like the 99 summer jam
bulletproof hummer man
im like being locked down around new faces and none of em fam
im the feelin of a millionaire spendin a hundred grand
im a poor mans dream a thug poet
live it and i write down and i watch it blow up
yall know what im like yall play it your system every night
now
