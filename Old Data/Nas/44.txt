yo
explode my thoughts were drunken from quarts of beers
was years back before nasir would explore a career in rap
as a music dude i mastered this rubiks cube
godzilla fought gargantua eyes glued to the tube
was a long time ago john boy ice
geronimo po-lice jumpin out chryslers easywider paper
pops puffin his sess punchin his chest like a gorilla
outside was psychoes killers
saw divine goon and chungo lil turkey
rip tyrone member no cursin front of ms vercey
big percy crazy paul the sledge sisters
my building was 40-16 once in the blue hallways was clean
i knew all that id seen had meant somethin
learned early to fear none little nas was huntin
livin carefree laughin got jokes on the daily
yall actin like some old folks yall dont hear me
yo im in my second childhood

[chorus repeat 2x]
cause when i flow the for the street -  who else could it be
n-a-s - nas
resurrect through the birth of my seed - queensbridge
make everything right - get yours nigga

yo dude is 31 livin in his moms crib
ex-convict was paroled there after his long bid
cornrows in his hair still slingin got a crew
they break his moms furniture watchin comicview
got babies by different ladies high smokin ls
in the same spot he stood since eighty-five well
when his stash slow he be crazy
say he by his moms hit her on her payday
junior high school dropout teachers never cared
they was paid just to show up and leave no one succeeds
so he moves with his peers different blocks different years
sittin on different benches like its musical chairs
all his peoples moved on in life hes on the corners at night
with young dudes its them he wanna be like
its sad but its fun to him right he never grew up
31 and cant give his youth up hes in his second childhood

[chorus]

[nas]
baby girl shes always talkin name droppin hangin late
drinkin smokin hates her baby daddy craves shoppin
e poppin ecstasy takin wont finish her education
best friend she keeps changin stuck with limitations
lustin men many hotels fendi chanel
with nothin in her bank account frontin she do well
her kid suffers he dont get that love he deserve
he the sun she the earth single mom even worse
no job never stay workin mad purty
shorty they call her the brain surgeon
time flyin she the same person never matures
all her friends married doin well
shes in the streets yakkety yakkin like she was 12
honey is twenty-seven argues fights
selfish in her own right for life  guess shes in her second childhood

[chorus]

who else could it be - n-a-s - nas
