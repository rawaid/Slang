where is he
the man who was just like me
i heard he was hiding somewhere i cant see
where is he
the man who was just like me
heard he was hiding somewhere i cant see
and im alone and i realize that when i get home
i wanna go through my red and my cherry
yes im alone and i realize when i get home
i wanna go through my red and my cherry

verse 1 nas
i want someone who like the champagne i like
my a-alike someone to talk me off the bridge any day or night
she teach me how to live she aint afraid of life
not easily impressed with the rich and famous life
cause she done been there and heard all the rumors before
she love or she ride out with me on my music tour
she like the herbs natural medicine she cooking good
she tell me everything is cool when it aint looking good
for real the world so ill yo i want a girl so real
who not after material wealth but get dough still
or maybe an educator a lady with etiquette
who can be from out the hood or even work for the president
as long as theres no selfishness
yes as long as her love for the people is deep rooted and evident
you can be easily recruited youre heaven sent
your smile put me at ease
youre the woman i need but where is she

verse 2 nas
i hate when people write me hostile texts on account of my lifestyles perception
invade my personal life out of the question what are they expecting
i be trying to reply and they never suppose i get my quiet time in
they think forever im rolling in dough swimming in a pool of cash
god wouldnt they know or am i a fool or ass
im well known got people coming at me mad
i had to tell homes i dont keep a cell phone my bad
i drag off the l and try to silence it
the noise in my head the curse of the talented
strong communicator vagabond i gallivant around the equator
and that would get me off the radar
its so intense im on my lilo and stitch
pour my pino grigio cris with some lime what is this
an immaculate version of me and my bitch by biggie
with all respect cause you the only one that gets me
