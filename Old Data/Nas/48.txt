yo i still run wit that 
that blood of a slave boiling in my veins

that blood of a slave heart of a king

turn my voice up

ayo the brothas stillmatic
i crawled up outta my grave wipin the dirt
cleanin my shirt they thought id make another illmatic/
but its always foward im movin never backwards stupid/
heres another classic c-notes are fallin from the sky/
by now the credits rollin starrin nas executive poet/
produced-directed by the kid slash escobar/
narration descibes the lives of lost tribes in the ghetto tryin to suvive/
the feature opens wit this young black child/
fingers scratch cigarette burns in the sofa/
turnin the tv down while mary jane girls 45s playin/
soft in the backround food from c-town mornings was hashbrowns/
stepped over dope fiends walkin out the door
all of us poor/ i learned the difference between the snitches
the real ones and whos soft and the murderous/
hungriest crews people jumpin from roofs shotguns pumpin
made it through my youth/ walk a very thin line
ages seven to nine/ thats the age i was on my album cover/
this is the rebirth i know the streets thirst/
water like moses walkin through the hot desert
searchin to be free this is my ending and my new beginning
nostalgia alpha and omega places its like a glitch in the matrix/
i seen it all and did it all most of yall pop for a minute
spit a sentence then the game will get rid of yall
yall got there but yall aint get it all/
i want my style back hate to cease ya plan its the rap repo man/
to them double up hustlas
bitter niggas who real professionals stick up kids dreamin for mils/
let my words guide you get inside you
from crypts to pyros this is survival/
