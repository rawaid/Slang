chorus nas pete rock

nas the world is yours the world is yours
pr its mine its mine its mine
whose world is this

i sip the dom p watching gandhi til im charged
then writing in my book of rhymes all the words pass the margin
to hold the mic im throbbing mechanical movement
understandable smooth shit that murderers move with
the thiefs theme play me at night they wont act right
the fiend of hip hop has got me stuck like a crack pipe
the mind activation react like im facing time like
pappy mason with pens im embracing
wipe the sweat off my dome spit the phlegm on the streets
suede timbs on my feets makes my cypher complete
whether cruising in a six-cab or montero jeep
i cant call it the beats make me falling asleep
i keep falling but never falling six feet deep
im out for presidents to represent me say what
im out for presidents to represent me say what
im out for dead presidents to represent me

pr whose world is this
nas the world is yours the world is yours
pr its mine its mine its mine
pr whose world is this
nas the world is yours the world is yours
pr its mine its mine its mine
whose world is this its yours
its mine its mine its mine
whose world is this
nas the world is yours the world is yours
pr its mine its mine its mine

to my man ill will god bless your life its yours
to my peoples throughout queens god bless your life
i trip we box up crazy bitches aiming guns in all my baby pictures
beef with housing police release scriptures thats maybe hitlers
yet im the mild money getting style rolling foul
the versatile honey sticking wild golden child
dwelling in the rotten apple you get tackled
or caught by the devils lasso shit is a hassle
theres no days for broke days when sellin smoke pays
while all the old folks pray to jesus soaking they sins in trays
of holy water odds against nas are slaughter
thinking a word best describing my life to name my daughter
my strength my son the star will be my resurrection
born in correction all the wrong shit i did hell lead a right direction
how ya living large a broker charge cards are mediocre
you flipping coke or playing spit spades in strip poker

its yours

chorus nas pete rock

pr its mine its mine its mine
pr whose world is this
nas the world is yours the world is yours
pr its mine its mine its mine
whose world is this its yours
its mine its mine its mine
whose world is this
nas yo the world is yours the world is yours
pr its mine its mine its mine
whose world is this its yours
pr break it down

*pete rock cuts and scratches its yours*

im the young city bandit hold myself down singlehanded
for murder raps i kick my thoughts alone get remanded
born alone die alone no crew to keep my crown of thorn
im deep by sound alone caved inside a thousand miles from home
i need a new nigga for this black cloud to follow
cause while its over me its too dark to see tomorrow
trying to maintain i flip fill the clip to the tip
picturing my peeps now they income could make my heartbeat skip
and im amped up they locked the champ up even my brains in handcuffs
headed for indiana stabbing women like the phantom
the crew is lamping big willie style
check the chip toothed smile plus i profile wild
stash through the flock wools burning dollars to light my stove
walk the blocks wit a bop checking dames plus the games
people play bust the problems of the world today

its yours

chorus nas pete rock

pr its mine its mine its mine
pr whose world is this
nas the world is yours the world is yours
pr its mine its mine its mine
whose world is this its yours
