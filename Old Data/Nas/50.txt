verse 1
peace to the five percenters online engine inventors
shout to them niggas family men bringin home dinners
watch out for desperate lonely women hurt ya happy home
miserable and alone kissable nice to bone
she not the type deserving of a throne
her beauty is her curse she fuck for shoes and a purse
make me a movie first can watch you on my phone
i shop in barcelona i spend some nights in rome
feel like a knight from england thats what i named my son knight
he was born to be one thats how my game was won
white 740 beamer licked by an angels tongue
im livin dangerous son she got a man a famous one
honey be pocket watchin she got a lot of options
hard to make up her mind decidin which baller to rock with
hot to death slim  but im not impressed
she got the hottest sex so i guess imma just
stay

verse 2
even though i dont like you next friday night cant wait to fight you
locked up i would knife you dont fuck with you
last month i even bucked at you you got locked
i felt bad wait do i got love for you
i might kill you but do i got love for you
i want you dead under 6 feet of soil
at the same time want you here to witness me while you in misery
we hate each other but its love what a thug mystery
years ago they ate the heart of a slain enemy
we enemies but your hatred could never enter me
some seek fame cause they need validation
some say hatin is confused admiration
spotlight on me i still look twenty
still get money lady killer pushin a bentley
maybe niggas could see too much of they failures through a nigga who realer
i dont like you near bruh but i need you to
stay
