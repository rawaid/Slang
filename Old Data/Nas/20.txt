the corleone fettucini capone 
roam in your own zone or get kidnapped and clapped in your dome 
we got it sewn the firm art of war is unknown 
lower your tone face it homicide cases get blown 
aristocrats politicking daily with diplomats

that niggas dead on a key of her-oin they found his head on 
the couch with his dick in his mouth i put the hit out 
yo the smoothest killer since bugsy bitches love me 
and queens where my drugs be i wear guess jeans and rugbies 
yo my people from medina they will see you 
when you re-up on your heater all your cream go between us

with mafia connections its the firm nigga set it

thirty-two grams raw chop it in half get sixteen double it times three 
we got forty-eight which mean a whole lot of cream 
divide the profit by four subtract it by eight 
we back to sixteen now add the other two that mega bringing through 
so lets see if we flip this other key 
then thats more for me mad coke and mad leak 
plus a five hundred cut in half is two-fifty 
now triple that times three we got three quarters of another key
