it was a murder jake just hit the corner people swarming 
three in the morning i jumped out my cab like fuck 
niggaz is buck mega bloodshed the tapes red 
i heard some bird whisper yo he should have ducked 
i puffed the lilla just before i hit the scene for rilla 
im all high its late im looking down at the feller
shits pushed in ambulance placed him on some cushion 
his moms had a stare i wouldnt dare second look when i murk 
it hurt kind of took it as a brief reminder 
that the streets designed to stop your life plot 
the beast in time yeah cell to cell suspect ass nigga you fell 
first time locked in crime stop my mind blocks the frail 
bursting blasting at your forty cal shell split your dry cell 
my niggas never snitch why tell

giving the jealous niggas sickness the witness 
my crew dresses in vest-es feel the essence 
try to test this scientist able and reckless 
slaughter nauticad down frames look petite 
ten millis mix designed just for my physique 
i keep a low pro as if i owe bless the flow lovely 
my pants hang low while im dancing sipping the bubbly 
hey me no worry hashish keep my eyes chinese 
rolling two phillies together make blunts siamese 
i meant it i represent it descendant made of 
early natives that were captured and taught to think backwards 
trapped us in a cracker psychiatric its massive 
a million man march alert the masses 
ten glocks armani in small print upon my glasses 
don assassins armageddon the wetting 
never freaking the beast seven heads got the righteous threatened 
life was written the plot curves behind the setting 
comprehend the grammar manfrione -- are you the type of nigga 
to shoot a leg to get your name known i flip the brain tome
niggaz get hit and wrap the plastic 
the mic i strike in vain giving the pain of what a mack is 
what you with luchi or drama no sleep means insomnia 
no need to check the clock the streets are timin you 

chorus 

[nas]
