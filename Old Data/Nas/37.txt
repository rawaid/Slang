uh uh yo
they plan was to knock me out the top of the game
but i overstand they truth is all lame
i hold cannons that shoot balls of flames
right in they fat mouth then i carve my name
nas - too real nas - true king
its however you feel ghead you swing
your arms too short to box with god
i dont kill soloists only kill squads
fame went to they head so now its fuck nas
yesterday you begged for a deal today you tough guys
i seen it comin
soon as i popped my first bottle i spotted my enemies tryna do what i do
came in with my style so i fathered you
i kept changin on the world since barbeque
now you wanna hang with niggas i hung with
fuck bitches i hit its funny i once said
if i ever make a record
i take a check and put something away for a rainy day to make my exit
but look at me now ten years deep
since in the project crack in my socks weep 
i never asked to be top of raps elite
just a ghetto child tryna learn the traps of the streets
but look at me now

chorus
youre the man youre the man
youre the man youre the man
youre the man youre the man
youre the man youre the man
youre the man youre the man

now wait a sec give me time to explain women and fast cars
and diamond rings can poison a rap star
its suicidal how i smoke in so much la
i saw a dead bird flyin through a broken sky
wish i could flap wings and fly away
to where black kings and ghana stay 
so i could get on my flesh right away
but thatll be the day when its peace
when my gat dont need to spray
when these streets are safe to play
sex with death indulge in these women
vision my own skeleton swimmin in eternal fire
broads play with pentagrams in they vagina
like the exorcist then they gave birth to my seeds
i beg for gods help why they love hurtin me
im your disciple a thug certainly
im the n the a to the s-i-r
if i wasnt i mustve been escobar
forty-five in my waist starin at my reflection
in the mirror sittin still in the chair like my conception
when everything around me got cloudy the chair became a kings throne
my destiny found me
its clear why the struggle was so painful
metamorphosis this is what i changed to
and god im so thankful

chorus to fade
