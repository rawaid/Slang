straight up shit is real and any day could be your last in the jungle
get murdered on the humble gunsll blast niggaz tumble
the corners is the hot spot full of mad criminals
who dont care guzzling beers we all stare
at the out-of-towners  ay yo yo who that  they better break north
before we get the four pounders and take their face off
the streets is filled with undercovers homicide chasing brothers
the das on the roof trying to watch us and knock us
and killer coppers even come through in helicopters
i drink a little vodka spark a l and hold a glock for
the fronters wannabe ill niggaz and spot runners
thinking it cant happen til i trap em and clap em
and leave em done wont even run about gods
i dont believe in none of that shit your facts are backwards
nas is a rebel of the street corner
pulling a tec out the dresser police got me under pressure

yo they call me nas im not your legal type of fella
moet drinking marijuana smoking street dweller
whos always on the corner rolling up blessed
when i dress its never nothing less than guess
cold be walking with a bop and my hat turned back huh
love committing sins and my friends sell crack
this nigga raps with a razor keep it under my tongue
the school drop-out never liked the shit from day one
cause life aint shit but stress fake niggaz and crab stunts
so i guzzle my hennessey while pulling on mad blunts
the brutalizer buddha sizer accelerator
the type of nigga who be pissing in your elevator
somehow the rap game reminds me of the crack game
used to sport ballys and gazelles with black frames
now im into fat chains sex and tecs
fly new chicks and new kicks heines and becks

no doubt; see my stacks are fat this is what its about
before the bdp conflict with mc shan
around the time when shante dissed the real roxxane
i used to wake up every morning see my crew on the block
every days a different plan that had us running from cops
if it wasnt hanging out in front of cocaine spots
we was at the candy factory breaking the locks
nowadays i need the green in a flash just like the next man
fuck a yard god let me see a hundred grand
could use a gun son but fuck being a wanted man
but if i hit rock bottom then ima be the son of sam
then call the crew to get live too
