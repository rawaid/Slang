yo; i never brag how real i keep it cause its the best secret 
i rock a vest prestigious cuban link flooded jesus 
in a lex watching kathie lee and regis 
my actions are one with the seasons 
a teck squeezing - executioner winter time i rock a fur 
mega popular center of attraction 
climaxin my bitches they be laughin g
they high from sniffing coke off a twenty-cent andrew jackson 
city lights spark a new york night 
rossi and martini sipping sergio tachinni flipping mad pies 
low price i blow dice and throw em 
forty-five by my scrotum manifest the do or die slogan 
my niggaz roll in ten m3s 
twenty gods popping wheelies on kawasakis 
hip-hops got me on some ol spraying shots like a drumroll 
blanking out and never miscount the shells my gun hold 
i dont stunt i regulate 
henny and sprite i separate watching crab niggaz marinate 
im all about tecks and good jucks and sex 
israelite books holding government names from ness 
emcees are crawling out every hole in the slum 
you be all right like blood money in a pimps cum

currency is made the trusted in messiah 
im spending it to get higher 
earth wind and fire singing reasons why im 
up early trustworthy is a nine that bust early 
sunshine on my grill i spill 
remi on imaginary graves put my hat on my waves 
latter day saints say religious praise 
i dolo challenge any team or solo 
you must be bugging out new to my shit home on a furlough 
ask around whos laid up sharp and straight up 
mafioso getting niggaz wigs sprayed up 
skies are misty my lifes predicted by a gypsy 
ill one day walk into shots drunk off champagne from sicily 
this be the drama ima pause like a comma 
in a sentence paragraphs indented 
bloodshot red eyes high yellow envelopes of lye 
opening cigars let tobacco fly 
condos are tuneproof were looking out the skys moonroof 
shitting like gin and prune juice 
yo the system wants the coons noose hang em high 
courtrooms filled up its off the hook while i 
just wrote a statement like im facing twenty years 
in the basement - chilling on the via with mumia 
for wearing chrome - i told the judge snakes slither like sharon stone
but like capone im thrown yo

lyrical ly-lyrical mission 
lyrical 
yo the time is wasting i use the mind elevation 
dime sack lacing court pen pacing 
individual lyrical math abrasion 
psychic evaluation the foulest nation 
we living in dangerous lives mad leak and battered wives 
a lifestyle where bad streets is patternized 
wise men build and destroy 
while the real mccoy dopefiend named detroit is still dealing boy 
coke suppliers actin gbiased 
cause rumours say that niggas wear wires and we liars 
but every night the gats fired and every day a rats hired 
i still remain the mack flyest in the fat kani its -- 
-- just the killer in me slash drug dealer mc 
ex-slug filler semi mug peeler 
demi bottles of mo yo simply follow me flow 
put poetry inside a crack pot and blow 
rough holes for cracked out pussies and buttholes 
bring the gs and the ds roll they cant touch those 
why shoot the breeze about it when you could be about it 
my degrees are routed toward the peasy haired brick houses 
instead of the fake medallions 
rich niggas transport in thousands 
foreign cash exchange amounting to millions 
doors is locked rocks is chopped watch the cameras in the ceilings 
trick bitches catching mad feelings 
peeling off in the lex jeep techniques is four-wheeling 
i bet it be some shit when we connect with stretch 
when we catch them sex niggas with the tecks you blessed word 
so now its on never wasted a slug 
time is money when it comes to mine take it in blood
