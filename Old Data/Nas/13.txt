b b boys and girls listen up
you can be anything in the world in god we trust 
an architect doctor maybe an actress
but nothin comes easy it takes much practice
like i met a woman who was becoming a star 
she was very beautiful leaving people in awe
singin songs later on but the younger version
hung wit the wrong person got her stunger than heroine
cocaine sniffin up drugs all in her nose
couldve died so young now looks ugly and old
no fun cause now when she reaches for hugs people hold thier breath 
cuz she smells of corrosion and death
watch the company you keep and the crowd you bring 
cause they came to do drugs and you came to sing
so if you gonna be the best ima tell you how
put your hands in the air and take the vow

i know i can i know i can
be what i wanna be be what i wanna be
if i work hard at it if i work hard at it
ill be where i wanna be ill be what i wanna be
[i know i can] i know i can
[be what i wanna be] be what i wanna be
[if i work hard at it] if i work hard at it
[ill be where i wanna be] ill be where i wanna be

b b boys and girls listen again
this is for grown looking girls whos only ten
the ones who watch videos and do what they see
as cute as can be up in the clubs with fake id
careful fore you meet a man with hiv
you can host a tv like oprah winfrey
whatever you decide be careful some men be 
rapists so act your age dont pretend to be 
older than you are give yourself time to grow 
youre thinking he can give you wealth but so 
young boy you could use a lot of help you know
ya thinkin lifes all about smokin weed and ice
you dont wanna be my age and cant read and write
beggin different women for a place to sleep at night
smart boys turn to men and do whatever they wish
if you believe you can achieve then say it like this

i know i can i know i can
be what i wanna be be what i wanna be
if i work hard at it if i work hard at it
ill be where i wanna be ill be what i wanna be
[i know i can] i know i can
[be what i wanna be] be what i wanna be
[if i work hard at it] if i work hard at it
[ill be where i wanna be] ill be where i wanna be

b before we came to this country
we were kings and queens never porch monkeys
there was empires in africa called kush
timbuktu where every race came to get books
to learn from black teachers who taught greeks and romans
asians arabs and gave them gold; when 
gold was converted to money it all changed
money then became empowerment for europeans
the persian military invaded
they heard about the gold the teachings and everything sacred
africa was almost robbed naked
slavery was money so they began making slaveships
egypt was the place that alexander the great went
he was in shock that in the mountains were black faces
shot off their nose to impose what basically
still goes on today you see
if the truth is told the youth can grow
theyll learn to survive until they gain control
nobody says you have to be gangsters hoes
read more learn more change the globe
ghetto children do your thing
hold your head up little man youre a king
young princess when you get your wedding ring
your man is saying shes my queen

i know i can i know i can
be what i wanna be be what i wanna be
if i work hard at it if i work hard at it
ill be where i wanna be ill be what i wanna be
[i know i can] i know i can
[be what i wanna be] be what i wanna be
[if i work hard at it] if i work hard at it
[ill be where i wanna be] ill be where i wanna be
