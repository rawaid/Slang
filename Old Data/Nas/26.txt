many years on this professional level
why would you question whos better the world is still mine
tattoos real with gods son across the belly
the boss of rap you saw me in belly with thoughts like that
to take it back to africa i did it with biggie
me and tupac were soldiers of the same struggle
you lames should huddle your teams shook
yall feel the wrath of a killer cause this is my football field
throwin passes from a barrel shoulder pads apparel
but the qb dont stand for no quarterback
every word is like a sawed-off blast cause yall all soft
and im the black hearse that came to haul yall ass in
its for the hood by the corner store
many try many die come at nas if you want a war get it bloody uh

[chorus]
