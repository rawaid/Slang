verse 1

dont hate me hate the money i see clothes that i buy
ice that i wear clothes that i dry
close your eyes picture me rollin
sixes money foldin
bitches honeys that swollen
the riches nas get in ya
most critically acclaimed pulitzer prize winner
best storyteller thug narrator my styles greater
model dater big threat to a lot of you haters
commentators bring aside try watchin my paper
almost a decade quite impressive
most of the best n the ssss
for this rap shit that i stand for
expanding more to the big screen
bill gates dreams
but it seems youd rather see me in jail
with state dreams
want me off the scene fast
but good things last
like your favorite mc still makin some mean cash
first rapper to bring a platinum plaque
back to the projects
but you still wanna hate be my guest
i suggest

money is power motherfucker
i got millions of thugs on salary bitch

do it now
chorus i wont stop
cant stop
you gonhate me
i hate you too
you can hate me now
you can hate me now

do it now i told you do it now lets go

verse 2

you wanna hate me then hate me
what can i do
but keep gettin money
funny i was just like you
i had to hustle hard never give up
until i made it
now yall sayin thats a clever nigga
nothing to play with
hate on me i blew but im the same ol g
people warn me when youre on top theres envy
took my niggas out the hood but you doubt on us
sayin we left the hood
but cant get it out of us
my bad should i step out my shoes
give em to you
heres my car and my house
you can live in that too
criticize when i flow for the streets
hate my dress code
gucci this fendi that
what you expect hoe
nickname esco
took this game to its threshold
best flow i bet the whole us know
try to make it like you the realest
but who the illest
think we all know the answer to that
cause niggas feel this right

you think im gonna come this far and let you niggas stop me now
i hate you too

do it now

chorus

i like this i like the way this feels

verse 3

its a thin line between paper and hate
friends and snakes nine millis and thirty-eights
hell or the pearly gates
i was destined to come
predicted blame god he blew breath in my lungs
second to none wicked turn wives to widows
shoot through satin pillows the desolate one
took a little time to claim my spot
jammin up the border to this game stop
and i side with the lord
ride for the cause
while driving niggas shot out my doors
plottin im sure to catch me
with they glocks to my jaw
try stickin me up but i
but i flipped on these ducks you tried
instead of me
ambulances were picking them up thats what you get
niggas fear what they dont understand
hate what they cant conquer
guess its just inferior man
became a monster atop of the world
never fallin
im as real as they come
from day one forever ballin
cmon

hey yall cant see a nigga like me never in your life
and thats what you cant understand

chorus x2
do it now do it now
do it now do it now
cmon
hate me now hate me now
cmon niggas cmon niggas
do it now get the shit over with
it aint gonna ever stop niggas
