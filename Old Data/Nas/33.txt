yo release whats in me 
besides the henny its eyes thats seen plenty 
fiends get skinny as if queens was a craig jenny 
instead of diet plans its crack 200 grams 
i pump a g-pack peeping for where the ds at 
its slow looking for rambo the cop who got grazed 
back in the days chasing niggas through my project maze 
that cop he got a death wish 
he run behind niggas until you breathless 
everyday he making ten arrests shit 
my nigga check this i know the bitch he rest with 
i even blessed it forty-dash-ten inspect it 
already checked it dunn near his ankle you could see his gun 
peep he parked his jeep in the back of the slum 
to check tanisha fat ass real fly with the blonde caesar 
vetacini summer gear she push the two-seater 
i heard she brag about the way he eat her 
a irish man short slim with a tan they say he laced her cheeba 
she do be looking weaker now her teeth are foul 
speaking loud peep her style in and out of every reefer cloud 
fat ass dissolving like cotton candy in a mouth thats starving
rock the same gear daily like a soldier in my squadron 
i heard she let jake investigate from her window 
cause shes a nympho sucking dick and coughing up info 
so now its set up her and the beast to get wet up 
i know he vest up we blazing from the neck up 
yo let me knock first soon as he open it your glock burst 
they had the chains on son hit the lock first 
we busted in the cop jerked 
jungle popped one in his shirt 
i grabbed the bitch by her tits she tried to say she earth 
we saw the cameras tape recorders and the monitors 
they eyeing us nas yo he survived one from the fo-five 
pull his shades down they seen his last days now 
theres no way now we can be treated just like a slave now 
two in the dome hes laid down aiyo the bitch is saved now 
shes living in a snitch grave now 

chorus nas 

shootouts is similar to wild west 
broad daylight face to face without a vest 
you know the episodes thugs camouflage the spectacles 
please god to save the life that the devil sold 
see it was written but was never told 
peep the jewels black man its even better than gold 
niggas roll with iron police roll in hot pursuit 
trying to stop the loot fuck jake cock and shoot 

[nas] 
still on the streets with my peeps so deep 
we threw a block party for my man going up creek 
to do his two to four niggas show love from all around the board 
peace lord sony handi-cam on record 
pop a bottle cause when you come home we still got it sewn 
we can watch the tape play back and just zone 
film all the bitches on the benches with ill extensions 
we block the streets off only crew cars can enter 
music was loud and it was crowded 
barbecued wings we fed the fiends gamble in the back killa shouted 
and frank tried to stop the bank loss about what a roley cost 
guzzled his drink and staggered off 
hes a big will used to slang krill now he own the hill 
couldnt take losing his cash and i could feel 
something in the air yeah frank returned with pierre 
a gun slinger who niggas hadnt seen in a year 
i usually be holding - specially this type of weekend 
and everyone except for me had started reaching
they had gats in each others faces with kids 
and grandmothers around franks only concern was his paper 
my man killa let off half of them fake niggas jet off 
police blitz quick waiting for that to set off 
running the static it got me mad cause they a bunch of faggots 
starting shit in my hood i cant have it 
yo high get the 40-cali stainless jake is still out 
lets make it real and still make them niggas famous 
dip behind trees in fatigues and squeeze dodge and weave 
hearing jake retaliating and wiz was up the alley waiting
we breeze jump in the ride heard pierre died 
internal bleeding inside and aint been back since 95
