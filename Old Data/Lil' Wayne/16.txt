verse 1
bring the crowd and im loud  in living colour 
it is weezy fuckin baby got these rappers in my stomach
yumi im takin it i aint asking them for nothing
if you sell a million records we can battle for ya money
i rather count a hundred thousand dollars on a sunday
watch a football game and bet it all on one play
still stuntin baby yes im still flossin
latest car on the market wit the top peeled off it
big wheels make it look a lil bulky
you look a lil salty have ya self a chill coffee
chill out the girls is still out
even though i am a boss and got papers to fill out
im busy i got paper to reel in
god i hope they snappin at the end of my rod
and i hope im fishing in the right pond
and i hope you catchin on to every line
who am i

hook
the best rapper alive 4x
swagger right check game tight
and they gon r-e-s-p-e-c-t me

and you should be afraid be very afraid

verse 2
the heart of new orleans
thumpin and beatin
livin and breathin
stealin and feedin
peelin and leavin

sell his chain celebrate block party second line
zulu ball essence fest jazz fest mardi gras
shotty bounce body rock

family cry tell the feds tell the cops
smell the rat comin back to the house
to the spot tap tap knock knock who is dat
pow trigga man hoodie man tell the kids
