lil wayne talking
so they ask me young boy what you gonna do the second time around
how you gon come back i tried to told them
i come back like 32 i jump back like 33 ugh
hit me its nothin this is tha carter ii people
this is tha carter ii people hey

verse 1
they call me mr carter i kissed the daughter
of the deads forehead i killed the father
spilled the heart of a mildew hater
i will put them body on chill like gla-ciers
gracias im crazy yes its obvious
going against me is atheist
i got my angels on my shoulders and a quarter of that angel dust
i aint sniffin im just pitchin ya honor i aint snitchin ya honor
hate bitch niggaz bitches with power
vacate when the kitchen get hotter
i just sit on the counter open the cabinet close the cupboard
put that jar in the skillet drop a 4 in the bubbles
i remember being young tryin to hustle my dough
tryin to tell the old junkies that my crack aint soap
tryin to tell you fool you chump that my mack aint broke
you aint tryin to see how far that black backlane go
no call me pacman you ghosts is blue
i got my red river rubies and my oceans blue
jewlery usually ima hooligan for the money
yeah im eatin but i got a tapeworm in my tummy oh
make harm in the bomb you in public
hit you with the straight arm no warning nothin
look its mornin no yawnin or nothin
i aint sleep and im up tryin to take a nigga lunch
you gon make a nigga break a nigga fronts
then shake a nigga shorts and we takin what we want
im so 5-0-4 you got to kill me here
if you ever lookin for me bitch i will be here
cash money is an army envy seal me here
lot of niggaz ran from it but ill still be here
no chrome on the continental im so fundamental
crack the phill crack the roof and roll up the window
and my hood love me they tell me bring it home
thats why i holla hollygrove on each and every song
you leapin at a dog a dog wit no bark
just a bite like an old shark
and all you rich niggas know pa
im talkin bout stunna
he like keep ya door he got ya whole winters
sunshines on the king and sets on the prince
i met the birdman and i been shinin ever since like that echo
