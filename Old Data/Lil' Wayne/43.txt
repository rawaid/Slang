intro
oh no no oh no no
oh no no oh no no oh no no

i play the bullshit from the backseat champ
yea im in the backseat still got the seat back
feet back stay from where the fake be at
niggaz snitch for the shine where the patience at
nigga make his own brother face his back
give love and take it back
good grief man this world is quite heavy on my aching back
cops killing for crack you know the story snakes eat rats
face the facts you cant change him cant shoot it if you cant aim it
cant miss him if he kill you then you cant blame him
thats just how the dice roll when you cant fade him
get too deep up in that water and they cant save ya
me i come out of that water like i was just bathing
and watch my step on a wet pavement
yea im from the hood so i rep em where i cant take em
holly grove holly grove was his last statement
so nigga get that look off your face
and recognize you got a crook in the place
they call me w-e-e crooked letter y im so high
i skeet skeet in any nigga dime like shes mine
streetsweeper in the back of the hatch make me pop the latch
leave you bloody with the cops to match
bullet holes in ya from the chopper blast
like ha ha
thats bullet holes in your sneakers got you hoppin back
it all stop when they hit you in ya top and back
no cocking back silly motherfucker you aint heard bout this
the clip sink down to the dick
thats a automatic shotty from a drum they call tommy
garunteed to get you bitches from by me
when i hit every piece of ya physical body he leakin
mortimer is no longer leapin he sleepin
while you pussy niggaz is sleepin he thinkin
deep in thought the boy aint even linkin
bob marley got me stinkin
stackin figures im standin firm lifes a slinky
pipes is filled with crack cocaine
and the dope go inside of the veins from where i came
though i bear a name only one call live with
coach they wont knock me off my pivot forget it
im sicker with it
pick a city buy a condo find a fine hoe let some time go chill
what you know about a bongo having her mind goover a convo about dough
nothing man the four wheelers look so good on the sand
tee or tanktop pocket fan
pocket knife no handgun in sight
just that rat tat tat tat tat tat tat tat boom
ha ha tonight i might just boost my feature price
cuz to each its own and the lights is bright
and im feelin like mike at a tyson fight
im from cita house big mommas house
she told me to shoot ya right after i knock ya out
and he aint gettin up after them shots if you hit him in the right spot
hold up the beat might drop

outro
oh no no oh no no
