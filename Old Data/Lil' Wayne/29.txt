sleepin at the top nightmares of the bottom
everybody wanna be fly til you swat em
but who am i to talk i aint shittin roses
we in in the same picture but we all got different poses

im looking in my rear view i see the world in it
i try to slow down and i get rear ended
pause like a red light im dead right
highway to heaven god do you see my headlights

they say you dont know what youre doing till you stop doing it
well call me clueless cause i do this
attention all shooters im a shooting star
life is a course and imma shoot for par

im searching for today instead i found tomorrow
and i put that shit right back like ill see what i find tomorrow
young money cmr im blood like a scar
im weezy f baby and the f aint for flaw

its like i have it all
but i dont have to worry
married to the money a true love story
only god can judge me i dont need a jury
nothing standing in my way like nothings my security
back to my journey that bullshit dont concern me
i knew i was going to jail i would have fucked my attorney

if you sleeping on me than i hope you toss and turning
im so cold im hypothermic ask yo girl she will confirm it
yeah
now what we doing with it
you keep opening ya grill im barbecuing with it
i know my shit already tight so i aint screwing with it
some say this shit is a joke well i hope they get it
ok im walking on needles sticking to the point
yeah the streets is talking im familiar with the voice
im a gangsta by choice i hope my sons choose wiser
and dont call me sir call me survivor
yeah

and i aint doing nothin but getting my share
breathin this air
if miss rochelle told me she gon keep me in her prayers
so im feeling alright im tryna stay aware
and if you wanna trip than imma meet ya there
to my niggas in the game keep the game fair
players play coaches coach and cheerleaders cheer
im tryna keep spirit when the ghost disappear
weezy f baby and the f aint for fear
uhhh
