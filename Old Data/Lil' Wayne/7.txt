cut the music up
a lil louder
yeah

you had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart
never really had luck couldnt never figure out
how to love how to love

you had a lot of moments that didnt last forever
now you in the corner tryna put it together
how to love how to love

for a second you were here now you over there
its hard not to stare the way you moving your body
like you never had a love never had love
 
when you was just a youngun your looks were so precious
but now your grown up so fly its like a blessing
but you cant have a man look at you for 5 seconds
without you being insecure

you never credit yourself so when you got older
its seems like you came back 10 times over
now youre sitting here in this damn corner
looking through all your thoughts and looking over your shoulder

see you had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart
never really had luck couldnt never figure out
how to love how to love

see you had a lot of moments that didnt last forever
now you in this corner tryna put it together
how to love how to love

for a second you were here now you over there
its hard not to stare the way you moving your body
like you never had a love had a love
 
ooohh you had a lot of dreams that transform to visions
the fact that you saw the world affected all your decisions
but it wasnt your fault wasnt in your intentions
to be the one here talking to me be the one listening

but i admire your poppin bottles and dippin
just as much as you admire bartending and strippin
baby so dont be mad nobody else trippin
you see a lot of crooks and the crooks still crook
 
you see you had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart
never really had luck couldnt never figure out
how to love how to love

see you had a lot of moments that didnt last forever
now you in this corner tryna put it together
how to love how to love
 
ooohh see i just want you to know
that you deserve the best
youre beautiful
youre beautiful
yeahh
and i want you to know
youre far from the usual
far from the usual
 
you see you had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart
never really had luck couldnt never figure out
how to love how to love

see you had a lot of moments that didnt last forever
now you in this corner tryna put it together
how to love how to love

see you had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart
never really had luck couldnt never figure out
how to love how to love

yeahh see you had a lot of moments that didnt last forever
now you in this corner tryna put it together
how to love how to love
