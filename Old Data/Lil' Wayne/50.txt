its kinda hard sayin this shit to ya face
so i do it over snares and bass
music take me away

verse one
young boy i know you love me like you never loved
you know you couldnt find a better thug
and uh you been peepin me since i was younger
so young that you even called me your little brother
but im all grown up now i got my own money
im married and divorced and my daughter is a woman
and guess what my daughter want another
sister or a brother and you lookin like a mother
i took you from a clubber to a lover
and you took another bitch husband
the other bitch wasnt doin shit for him
she say she did too much i say she did nothin
she need to quit frontin
i havent hid nothin and you love everything
cant hide ya feelings cant let my pride conceal it
you got wayne i charge it to the game
and baby you can keep the change but

verse two
destiny child cd song number three
she cater to me till we fall asleep
then we wake up and we pick up where we started
then she make a nigga breakfast sprite orange juice and water
and she on stage waitin for me after my show
so no time for groupies straight to the top flo
fresh out the shower a smile and a towel
then after an hour she gon need another shower
im at home or in the coupe or in the office
or the streets or in the booth thinkin bout you
and most of the girls that come by are cute
and they try to holla but they all on mute
and my old girls turn they face up at me
and they thrown they purses and they make up at me
cuz you got wayne i charge it to the game
and baby you can keep the change but

chorus - 2x

verse 3

she done cleaned the whole house
washed the dishes and the clothes
and we out we do it just how we supposed
look good for the public leave the drama in the rolls
royce choice of car dat we move
and she gets high sometimes cause im always doin it
you hear them hallways we always doin it
work cut always feel like the first one
perfect when a nigga stressed off dat work shit
take away all the pain make it lesser than dirt
thats why you got wayne i charge it to the game
and baby you can keep the change but
