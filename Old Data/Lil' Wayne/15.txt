intro lil wayne &amp; nurse
wheres my coffee
good morning doctor carter hey sweetie
looks like its going to be a long day ahh another one what we got
your first patient yeah
is suffering from a lack of concept uh-huh
originality ugh
his flow is weak another one
and he has no style ugh
whatcha got for um

verse 1 lil wayne
ok let me put my gloves on
and my scrubs on
drcarter to the rescue
excuse me if im late
but like a thief it takes time to be this great
honestly just wait 
your style is a disgrace your rhymes are fifth place and im just grace
one uno ace and im tryin to make your heart beat like bass
but your sweet like cake and i come to fix whatever you shall break 
where is your originality you are so fake
so picture me like a gallery- capture what i say
all i need is one mic all i need is one take
like hey brighter than the sun ray got a pistols on the playground
watch the gunplay like no kidding no kids in the way
but the kids do watch gotta watch what we say gotta work everyday
gotta not be cliche
gotta stand out like andre 3k
gotta kick it kick it like a sensai
you gotta have faith you gotta gotta wait wait

i think i i think i lost him dial one eighteen please

nurse
good afternoon dr carter
i dont know about this one
his confidence is down
vocab and metaphors need work
and he lost respect for the game aaahhhhh lemme see

you think you can save him


verse 2 lil wayne
okay respect is in the heart
so thats where ima start
and a lot of heart patients dont make it
now hey kids-- plural-- i graduated
cause you could get through anything if magic made it
and that was called recycling
or rereciting
something cause you just like it
so you say it just like it
some say its biting
but i say its enlightening
besides dr kanye west is one of the brightest
and dr swizz can stitch your track up the tightest
and dr jeezy can fix your back up the nicest
arthritis in my hand from writing
but ima doctor they dont understand my writing
so i stop writing
now im like lightning
and you aint fish young so dont clash with the titans
fast and exciting
my passion is frightening
now let me put some more vocab in your iv
here take this vicodin
like it and love it
and confidence has no budget so pay me no mine i dont walk like i talk it cause im running i dont do it cause i done it and im in the emergency punnet

goddamn it ive lost another one

nurse
good evening dr carter its been a long day
but this one looks much better than the others
his respect is back up his concepts sound good 
his style is showing strong signs of improvement
all he needs now is his swagger ok lemme take my gloves off then

verse 3 lil wayne
swagger tighter than a yeast infection
fly go hard like geast erection
fashion patrol police detection
i stay tight like chinese connection
i stay tight like pussy at night
baby dont get me wrong i could do that pussy right
but im to wrong to write
to fresh to fight
to paid to freestyle
to paid to freestyle
i had to say it twice
swagger so nice
and dont ask me shit unless it concern a price
and i dont rap fast i rap slow
cause i mean every letter in the words in the setence of my quotes
swagger just flow sweeter than honey oats
that swagger i got it i wear it like a coat
wait as i put the light down his throat
i can only see flow
his blood starting to flow
his lungs starting to grow
this one starting to show
strong signs of life
wheres the stiches heres the knife
smack his face his eyes open
i reply with a nice welcome back
hip hop i saved your life
