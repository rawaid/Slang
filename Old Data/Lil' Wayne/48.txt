swimming laps around a bottle of louis the thirteenth
jumpin off of a mountain into a sea of codeine

and if i should ever fall the ground would then turn to wine

i can mingle with the stars and throw a party on mars
i am a prisoner locked up behind xanac bars
i have just boarded a plane without a pilot
and violets are blue roses are red
daisies are yellow the flowers are dead
wish i can give you this feeling i feel like buying
and if my dealer dont have no more then
i feel like dying

only once the drugs are done that i feel like dying i feel like dying
