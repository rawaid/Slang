[verse 1 lil wayne]
i tell her now gon pop that pussy for a real nigga
i already know that life is deep but i still dig her
niggas is jealous but really i could care less
im in hells kitchen with an apron and a hairnet

devil on my shoulder the lord is my witness
so on my libra scale im weighing sins and forgiveness
what goes around comes around like a hoola hoop
karma is a bitch well just make sure that bitch is beautiful

life on the edge im dangling my feet
i tried to pay attention but attention paid me
haters cant see me nose-bleed seats
and today i went shopping and talk is still cheap

i rock to the beat of my drum set
i been at the top for a while and i aint jump yet
but im ray charles to the bullshit
now jump up on that dick and do a full split

[hook drake]
she just started to pop it for a nigga and looked back
told me baby its real
and i say i aint doubt you for a second i squeeze it i could tell how it feel
i wish we could take off and go anywhere but here
baby you know the deal

cause she bad so maybe she wont but shit then again maybe she will
do it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now she will
do it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now she will
maybe for the money and the power and fame right now she will
do it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now she will

[verse 2 lil wayne]
and i tell her go on pop that pussy for me
haters cant see me but bitches still looking for me
and you could take it to the bank and deposit that
put your two cents in and get a dollar back
some people hang you out to dry like a towel rack
im all about i give the rest of the vowels back

i like my girl thick not just kinda fine
eat her til she cry call that wine and dine
try to check me and imma have em checkin pulses
they say choose wisely thats why i was chosen

rocking like the asphalt its the cashs fault
looked in the face of death and took its mask off
now i like my house big and my grass soft
i like my girls face south and her ass north
but im ray charles to that bullshit
now hop up on my dick and do a full split
