verse 1
we are not the same
i am a martian
and im hotter than summer rain like carl thomas
lock load ready to aim at any target
i could get your brains for a bargain
like i bought it from target
hip-hop is my supermarket
shopping cart full of fake hip-hop artists
im starving sorry
i gotta eat all it
and i be back in the morning

chorus

verse 2

we are not the same
i am a alien
like gonzalez
young college student
whodnt just flip the game like houston
im used to promethazine
in two cups im screwed up
and ya aint $**t 
if ya aint never been screwed up
flow so sick 
make ya wanna throw ya food up
ice for the chest
and my wrist like a crew cup
two twig clippers
ill give your hair some crew cuts
i get bread like cold cuts
ya know what
ya girl go down fast
come up slow
but i never slow up
weezy

chorus

verse 3
they dont make them like me no more
matter fact they never made it like me before
im rare like mr clean with hair
no break lights on my car rear
i never had life
and i never had fear
i rap like i done died and gone to heaven
i swear
and yeah im a bear
like black and white hair
so im polar 
and they cant get on my system
‘cause my system is tha solar
i am so far from the othars
im in others
id a eat them for supper
get in my space ship and hover 

chorus
