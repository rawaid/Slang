i can see the end in the beginning
so im not racing im just sprintin
cuz i dont wanna finish
they diminish i replenish
scientific

no homo fingernails dirty
ive been counting dirty money since 1230 a-m

yea i just do my wayne and every time i do it i do my thing yea
believe that like a true story
rims big make the car look like its two stories
if i hop out - that be suicide
no back seats call that paralyze

i tote a tool box ‘bitch its hammertime
