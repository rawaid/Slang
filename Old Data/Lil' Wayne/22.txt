money over bitches im yellin it to the grave
developed at a young age go after what pays
these gabana sunshades block the sunrays
i drop a car note in the mall on the first day
i gotta get it even if its in the worst way
that cake like its its my birthday
new orleans my birthplace ya heard me
where moneys more important than the person

twistin up a blunt thinkin bout my next dollar
im diggin in the game tryna get some money out her
im so vain its a problem
it aint a stain on these pradas im just bein modest
got me a goddess sure how to divide it
she still down and she dont get none of the profit
we around the city let the tints hide me
thats a cold muhfucker whoever inside it
forever symbolizing the grind it dont walk to you
i make it run like horses do
giddy up baby if you got it then hit em up baby
i know its crazy but i cant get enough baby

im a self made millionaire fuck the public
ridin to myself cause i dont fuck with nothin
pistol on my lap on the way to the money
