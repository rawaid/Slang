verse 1
i tried to talk to him
quit talkin ima hang ya by your tongue yea
any motormouth could get hung high
we dont fuck wit niggaz like fungi
we dont even hear ya
hollerin bullshit nigga quit the diaherra
pistol lie inside of the armrest um yes
lay a nigga down in his own mess dont mess
playa fuck around wit the homeless charmless
you can leave out here armless no homies
honest you niggaz is harmless
im calm as a don is supposed to be
costa nostra dont ever approach him
dont get close to him
shootouts and nothin but rock n roll to him
leave your blood on the dash call it rose wood
nother murder nother page out the notebook
it aint nothin it dont make it if you no good
i tried to talk to him but then a nigga had to

chorus
hit em up hit em up
i aint even wanna hit em up really i was tryna be calm
but uh that chopper rrrot put his head in his arms
and man i tried to talk to him i tried to talk to him

i tried to talk to him i tried to talk to him

hit em up hit em up
i aint even wanna hit em up hit em up
i aint even wanna hit em but i hit em up gun shot
i tried to talk to him i tried to talk to him

verse 2
yall take them shoes off your teeth
stop runnin your mouth
no shoes no feet ill run in your mouth
ill come to your house me and my goons
loadin up bangers ridin under the moon
throwin up fingers sayin my side rule
if a nigga disagree ask him must i prove
that maybach coupe a cock-eyed fool
and im in it like bennet hoe arent i cool
but if that thermostat switch and that needle move
then the attitude switch and the heatll move
i got that shakita banana clip for the tool
me the disaster pity the fool eat a catastrophe
swallow the truth belch reality
how does it taste pie to your face you a bitch nigga
all pussy stop comin out your lips nigga
i tried to talk him but then a nigga had to

chorus

verse 3
real talk boy chill wit the talk boy
that tommy gunll tear your neighborhood apart boy
yeah leave your feelings in your heart boy
start with the wrong boy you end wit a stone boy
wit your friends to carry you alone
to a concrete mattress and a fluffy tombstone
fuck discussion i aint in to it boy
i just get to it lets do it rip through a boy
big uzi tissue the boy
im inside lookin out you just an intruder boy
you need sooches on your smooches boy
but i tried to talk to him but then a nigga had to

chorus
