immmmm
rolling down the hill im snowballing getting bigger
an explosion in the chamber the hammer from the trigger
i seen him get stabbed i watched the blood spill out
he had more cuts than my man chuck chillout

24 is my age and 22 is my gauge
im writing rhymes on a page im goin off in a rage
cause im out on a mission a stolen car mission
had a small problem with the transmission

3 on the tree in the middle of the night
i have this steak on my head cause i got into a fist fight
life comes in phases take the good with the bad
you bought the coins on the street holmes and you know you got had

because its all high spirit you know you gotta hear it
dont touch the mic baby dont come near it
its gonna get you its gonna get you
its gonna get you girl its gonna get you

lookin down the barrel of a gun
son of a gun son of a bitch
getting paid getting rich

ultra violence be running through my head
cole madenia yall makin me see red
rapid fire louie like rambo got bullets
ima die harder like my kid bruce willis

i love girlies waxin and milkin
coordinating chimp is my man dave scilken smokie
predetermined destiny is who i am
you got your finger on the trigger like the son of sam

i am like clockwork orange goin off on the town
ive got homeboys bonanza to beat your ass down
well im mad at my desk and id be writing all curse words
expressing my aggressions through my schizophrenic verse words

youre a headless chicken chasin a sucker freebasin
youre looking for a fist to put your face in
well get hip get hip dont slip you knuckle heads
racism is schism on a serious tip
