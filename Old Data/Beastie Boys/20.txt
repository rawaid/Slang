because mutiny on the bountys what were all about
im gonna board your ship and turn it on out
no soft sucker with a parrot on his shoulder
cause im bad gettin bolder cold getting colder

terrorizing suckers on the seven seas
and if youve got beef youll get capped in the knees
we got sixteen men on a dead mans chest
and i shot those suckers and ill shoot the rest

most illingest b-boy i got that feeling
cause i am most ill and im rhymin and stealin

snatching gold chains vicking pieces of eight
i got your money and your honey and the fly name plate
we got wenches on the benches and bitties with titties
housing all girlies from city to city

one for all and all for one
taking out mcs with a big shotgun
all for one and one for all
because the beastie boys have gone awol

friggin in the riggin and cuttin your throat
big biting suckers getting thrown in the moat
we got maidens and wenches man theyre on the ace
captain bly is gonna die when we break his face

most illingest b-boy i got that feeling
i am most ill and im rhymin and stealin
