def jam right about now

now i chill real ill when i start to chill
when i fill my pocket with  a knot of dollar bills
sipping pints of ale out the window sill
when i get my fill im chilly chill

now i just got home because im out on bail
whats the time - its time to buy ale
peter eater - parking meter all of the time
if i run out of ale - its thunderbird wine

miller drinking - chicken eating - dress so fly
i got friends in high places that are keeping me high
down with mike d and it aint no hassle
got the ladies of the eighties from here to white castle

hold it now - hit it
yo leroy
its my rhyme

mc - adam yauch in the place to be
and all the girls are on me cause im down with mike d
im down with mike d and it aint no baloney
for real not phony - oe and rice-a-roni

i come out at night cause i sleep all day
and im the king ad-rock and hes mca
well im cruising im bruising im never ever losing
im in my car im going far and dust is what im using

around the way is where im from
and im from manhattan and im not a bum
because youre pud-slapping ball-flapping got that juice
my names mike d and i can do that jerry lewis

hold it now - hit it
yo leroy

hip-hop body rockin - doing the do
beer drinking breath stinking sniffing glue
belly flipping always illing busting caps
my names mike d and i write my own snaps

im a peep-show seeking on the forty-deuce
im a killer at large and im on the loose
pistol-packing monkey-drinking no-money bum
i come from brooklyn cause thats where im from

cheap-skate perpetrating money hungry jerk
everyday i drink a oe and i dont go to work
you drippy nose knuckle-head - youre wet behind the ears
you like men and we like beer

hold it now - hit it
yo leroy

king of the ave with the def female
youre rhyming and stealin with the freshest ale
cooling at the crib watching my tv
ed norton - ted knight - and mr ed

pump it up homeboy just dont stop
chef boy-ar-dee cooling on the pot
i take no slack cause i got the knack
im never dusting out cause i torch that crack

the king ad-rock - that is my name
and youre drinking moet - we got the champagne
a quarter dropping - going shopping buying wigs
surgeon general cut professor - dj thigs

hold it now - hit it
hit it
hold it now - hit it
yo leroy
