i cant stand it i know you planned it
im a set straight this watergate
i cant stand rocking when im in here
cause your crystal ball aint so crystal clear
so while you sit back and wonder why
i got this fuckin thorn in my side
oh my god its a mirage
im tellin yall its sabotage

so listen up cause you cant say nothin
youll shut me down with a push of your button
but im out and im gone
ill tell you now i keep it on and on

cause what you see you might not get
and we can bet so dont you get souped yet
youre scheming on a thing thats a mirage
im trying to tell you now its sabotage

whyyyyyyyyyyy
our backs are now against the wall
listen all of yall its a sabotage
listen all of yall its a sabotage
listen all of yall its a sabotage
listen all of yall its a sabotage

i cant stand it i know you planned it
im a set straight this watergate
i cant stand rockin when im in this place
because i feel disgraced because youre all in my face
but make no mistakes and switch up my channel
im buddy rich when i fly off the handle
what could it be its a mirage
youre scheming on a thing thats sabotage
