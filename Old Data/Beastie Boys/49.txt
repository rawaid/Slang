im not the type of person who likes to waste my time
and when im on the mic - i just say my rhymes
because im out on bail - the check is in the mail
they can sentence me to life - but i wont go to jail

im cool calm collected - from class i was ejected
just me mike d and mca - were rarely disrespected
i got all the time that i need to kill
whats that time its time to get ill

you been fully captivated by that funky-ass bass
your girlfriend screams when mcas in the place
he stumbles in the room with the chivas in his hand
cold chillin on the spot at the microphone stand

id have the pedal to the metal if i had a car
but im chiller with the miller - cold coolin at the bar
i can drink a quart of monkey and still stand still
whats the time its time to get ill

went outside my house - i went down to the deli
i spent my last dime to refill my fat belly
i got rhymes galime - i got rhymes galilla
and i got more rhymes than phyllis diller

mca takes a stand - man youre in command
homeboy turn it out and dont give a damn
my name is mca - ive got a license to kill
and whats the time its time to get ill

im mr ed
the famous mr ed

riding down the block with my box in my hand
today i feel like chillin just as chill as i can
coolin on the corner with a forty of oe
cause me and mca were down with mike d

when i run a jam - i dont give a damn
when im throwing bass - i say thank you maam
fuel injected rhyme connected - running things
im the king ad-rock and im the king of all kings

im looking for a spot - things are gettin hot
im mca im here to stay - and you sir are not
