now heres a little story i gots to tell
about three bad brothers you know so well
it started way back in history
with ad-rock mca and me mike d

i  had a little horsey named paul revere
just me and my horsey and a quart of beer
ridin cross the land kickin up sand
sheriffs posses on my tail cause im in demand

one lonely beastie i be
all by myself without nobody
the sun is beatin down on my baseball hat
the air is gettin hot the beer is gettin flat

lookin for a girl i ran into a guy
his name is mca i said howdy he said hi

he told a little story that sounded well rehearsed
four days on the run and that hes dying of thirst
the brew was in my hand and he was on my tip
his voice was hoarse his throat was dry he asked me for a sip

he said can i get some
i said you cant get none
i had a chance to run
but he pulled out his shotgun
quick on the draw i thought id be dead
he put the gun to my head and this is what he said

now my name is mca i got a license to kill
i think you know what time it is its time to get ill
so what do we have here an outlaw and his beer
i run this land you understand ive made myself clear

we stepped into the wind he had a gun i had a grin
as if this storys over but its ready to begin

ive got the gun youve got the brew
youve got two choices of what you can do
its not a tough descision as you can see
i can blow you away or you can ride with me

i said ill ride with you if you can get me to the border
the sheriff is after me for what i did to his daughter
i did it like this i did it like that
i did it with the whiffle ball bat

so im on the run the cops got my gun
and right about now its time to have some fun
the king ad-rock that is my name
and i know the fly spot where they got the champagne

we rode for six hours then we hit the spot
the beat was-a-bumpin and the girlies was hot
this dude was starin like he knows who we are
we took the empty spot next to him at the bar

mca said yo you know this kid
i said i didnt but i knew he did
the kid said get ready cuz this aint funny
my name is mike d and im about to get money

he pulled out the jammy aimed it at the sky
he yelled stick em up and let two fly
hands went up and people hit the floor
he wasted two kids that ran for the door

im mike d and i get respect
your cash and your jewelry is what i expect
mca what with it and hes my ace
so i grabbed the piano player and punched him in the face

the piano players out the music stopped
this boy had beef and he got dropped
mike d grabbed the money mca snatched the gold
i grabbed two girlies and a beer thats cold
