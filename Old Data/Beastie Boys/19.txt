listen to the ladies come on and let me spawn
all your eggs then you go up the river
listen to the abstract that freaky nigga
im ad rock and i shock and i tick and i tock
and i cant stop with the body rock
see ive got heart like john starks
hitting mad sparks
pass me the mic and ill be rocking the whole park
im the m to the c to the a and its a must
the rhymes that we bust on the topic of lust
and my moms is not butt but fuck it
let me get down to the rhythm
yes im getting funky and im shooting all my jism
like john holmes the x-rated nigga

nobodys getting any bigger than this

*get it together* 
*get it together*
phone is ringing oh my god
*get it together*
*see whats happening*

ad rock down with the ione

so why all the fight and why all the fuss
because hey *i aint got no dust*

i dont think im slick nor do i play like im hard
but i shall drive the lane like i was evan bernhard
and im working on my game because life is taxing
got to get it together and see whats happening

*get it together* 
*get it together* 
*get it together* 
*see whats happening*

i go one two like my name was biz mark
but i had to do the shit just let me embark
on the lyric and the noun and the verb
lets kick the shit off cause yo im not the herb
well its not the herb but the spice with the flavor to spare
tho moog with the funk for your derriere
while were on that topic yes i like to mention
when it comes to boning im representing
spacing zoning talkin on the phone and
my brain is roaming and i dont know where its going
talking lots of shit a little tweaking on the weekend

well im a funky skull and im a scorpio
and when i get my flow im dr on the go
so q-tip what you on the mic for
because i had to talk about the times that i rhyme
and when mcs come in my face im like mace
because i back them off with the quills

resting on nine one one sixteenth ave off the farmers boulevard

praying mantis on the court and i cant be beat
so yo tip whats up with the boots on your feet
ive got the timbals on my toes and this is how it goes
