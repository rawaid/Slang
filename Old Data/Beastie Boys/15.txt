hey
hey ladies in the place im callin out to ya
there never was a city kid truer and bluer
theres more to me than youll ever know
and ive got more hits than sadaharu oh

tom thumb tom cushman or tom foolery
date women on tv with the help of chuck woolery
words are flowing out just like the grand canyon
and im always out looking for a female companion

i threw the lasso around the tallest one and dragged her to the crib
i took off her moccasins and put on my bib
im wheelin and dealin i make a little bit of stealing
ill bring you back to the place and your dress im peeling

your bodys on time and your mind is appealing
staring at the cracks up there upon the ceiling
such and such will be the bass that im throwing
im talking to a girl telling her im all knowing well

shes talking to the kid to the kid
im telling her every lie that you know that i never did
hey ladies *a get funky*
*all the ladies in the house*
*the ladies the ladies*

well
me in the corner with a good looking daughter
i dropped my drawers and said welcome back kotter
we was cutting up the rug she started cutting up the carpet
in my apartment i begged her please stop it

the gift of gab is the gift that i have
and that girl aint nothing but a drag
educated no stupid yep
and when i say stupid i mean stupid fresh

im not james at 15 or chachi in charge
im adam and im adamant about living large
with the white sassoons and the looks that kill
makin love in the back of my coupe de ville then

i met a little cutie she was all hopped up on zootie
i liked the little cutie but i kicked her in the bootie
cause i dont kinda go for that messin around
you be listening to my records a number one sound

just step to the rhythm step step to the ride
ive got an open mind so why dont you all get inside
tune in tune on to my tune thats live
ladies flock like bees to a hive

hey ladies *a get funky*
hey hey hey hey ladies
*girls girls*
hey hey hey hey ladies
one more time *aint it funky now*
hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey ladies
*aint it funky*

you know that
shes got a gold tooth you know shes hardcore
shell show you a good time then shell show you the door
break up with your girl it ended in tears
vincent van gogh go and mail that ear

call her in the middle of the night when im drinkin
the phone booth on the corner is damp and its stinkin
said come on over it was me that she missed
i threw that trash can through her window cause you know i got dissed

your old lady left you and you went girls girls girls insane
you blew yourself up in the back of the 6 train well
take my advice at any price
a gorilla like your mother is mighty weak man

sucking down pints till i didnt know
woke up in the morning with the one ton ho
cause i announce i like girls that bounce
with the weight that pays about a pound per ounce

girls with curls and big long locks
and beatnik chicks just wearing their smocks
walking high and mighty like shes number one
*she thinks shes the passionate one*

hey ladies *a get funky*
*whats that*
*good god*
*good god* *damn*
*good god*
*baby baby baby baby*

*is it funky brother*
*hee ha ha ha*
