and on the cool check in
center stage on the mic
and were puttin it on wax
its the new style

four and three and two and one what up
and when im on the mic - the suckers run word
down with adrock and mike d and you aint
and i got more juice than picasso got paint
got rhymes that are rough and rhymes that are slick
im not surprised youre on my dick mike d

b-e-a-s-t-i-e what up mike d
ah yeah thats me
i got franks and pork and beans
always bust the new routines
i get it - i got it i know its good
the rhymes i write - you wish you would

im never in training - my voice is not straining
people always biting and im sick of complaining
so i went into the locker room during classes
went into your locker and i smashed your glasses
youre from secausus - im from manhattan
youre jealous of me because your girlfriend is cattin

there it is - kick it

father to many married to none
and in case youre unaware i carry a gun
stepped into the party the place was overpacked
saw the kid that dissed my homeboy and shot him in the back

i had to get a beeper cause my phone is tapped
you better keep your mouth shut cause im fully strapped
i got money in the bank i can still get high
thats why your girlfriend thinks that im so fly

ive got money and juice twin sisters in my bed
their father had envy so i shot him in the head
if i played guitar id be jimmy page
the girlies i like are underage check it

girls with boyfriends are the kind i like
ill steal your honey like i stole your bike
my father hes jealous cause im making that green
ive got the girlies numbers from the places i been

there it is - kick it

you wanna know why - because im
october 31st - that is my date of birth
i got to the party you know what i did the smurf
taxing all females from coast to coast
and when i get my fill im chilly most

we rag-tag girlies back at the hotel
and then we all switch places when i ring the bell
i chill at white castle cause its the best
but im fly at fat burger when i way out west

k-i-n-g-a-d whammy
all the fly ladies are on my jammy
went to the prom - wore the fly blue rental
got six girlies in my lincoln continental

i had this girl at the party and she started to flirt
i told her some rhymes and she pulled up her skirt
spent some bank - i got a high powered jumbo
rolled up a wooly and i watched colombo

let me clear my throat - kick it over here baby pop
and let all the fly skimmies feel the beatdrop

coolin on the corner on a hot summers day
just me my posse and mca
a lot of beer - a lot of girls - and a lot of cursing
twenty-two automatic on my person

got my hand in my pocket and my fingers on the trigger
my posses gettin big and my posses gettin bigger
some voices got treble some voices got bass
we got the kind of voices that are in your face

like the bun to the burger and like the burger to the bun
like the cherry to the apple to the peach to the plum
im the king of the ave - and im the king of the block
im mca - and im the king adrock

well im mike d - i got all the fly juice
on the checkin at the party on the forty deuce
walking down the block with the fresh fly threads
beastie boys fly the biggest heads

ho
