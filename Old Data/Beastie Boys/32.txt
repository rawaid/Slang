so so so just sit back and max and relax
off the tracks that i kick come on and give it up cause
i get funky like diaper rash and
you know im mad spunky and im makin cash

ive got sex rhymes like victoria got secrets
to all you porn peepers who are trying to peep this
im like al goldstein im all about screwin
lead my team to sixty wins like my man pat ewing

like gettin shot out the barrel of a wave
like a virgin pow on the peaks of ak
like a sound that goes the depths of the soul
thats the feelin that i make my goal

uh
check it out

a little wine with my dinner so im in my grape ape
i feel like a winner when i make a mix tape
cause i get ill when im on the pause button
and i get my fill and now you cant say nothin

more soul on this train than don cornelious
i got the mad subwoofer pumpin bass for your anus
just gettin on the mic at the monthly function
wires hittin switches connectin at the junction

pearlmans got beats and it aint no secret
dante found his shit and you know he freaked it
and so the story goes on and on
down in sd 50 till early mornin
