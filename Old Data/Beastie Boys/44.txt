hello

its times like this when i just cant stop
cant wind your body without the body rock
got schemes schematics blueprints on file
you got to have the dreams to make it all worthwhile

so as i take my time and realign
i wonder what it is i hope to find
i dont mean to brag i dont mean to boast
but im intercontinental when i eat french toast

ad rock with the new edition
gettin on down for the year 2000
a slight distraction can get you paid
and when it comes to that type shit i paved the way

b-boys to the early morn
b-girls be rockin on and on
b-girls to the break of dawn
b-boys be rockin on and on

dogs love me cause im crazy sniffable
now i bet you never knew i got the ill peripheral
in your home im cloned im on your headphones
i love it when you spaz out all alone

cause im that fool that broke the key
im unlockable so dont check me
i got weight on my shoulders and things on my mind
the sky is falling and im falling behind

so i synthesize sounds as i patch my brain
insane mind games move quick like flames
so now i wonder how sometimes you never know
who be rockin yall in stere-ere-o
in stere-ere-o in stere-ere-o in stereo

no time like the present to work shit out
thats what we going on and on and on about
im not fakin just makin beats in the dungeon
keep that shit funky cause the odor is pungent

no shame in my game just par for the path
i try to hone my craft because at hands the task
but i find im not playing with a full deck
im up to my neck like toulouse lautrec

all i wanna know is when is checkout time
so i could be in heaven with the rhythm rock rhyme
and when im with my man shadi rock at the gates
well be rockin rhythms over disco breaks

b-boys to the early morn
b-girls be rockin on and on
b-girls to the break of dawn
b-boys be rockin on and on
on and on 
on and on repeats

*hubo una vez un gran rey
que tenia muchas tierras 
un castillo y tambien un amor
hubo una vez un gran rey
que tenia muchas tierras 
un castillo y tambien un amor
hoy el rey
hoy el rey*
