girls
all i really want is girls
and in the morning its girls
cause in the evening its girls

i like the way that they walk
and its chill to hear them talk
and i can always make them smile
from white castle to the nile

back in the day
there was this girl around the way
she liked my home-piece mca
he said he would not give her play

i asked her please - she said you may
her pants were tight and thats okay
if she would dance i would dj
we took a walk down to the bay

i hope shell say
hey me and you should hit the hay
i asked her out she said no way
i should have probably guessed her gay

so i broke north with no delay
i heard she moved real far away
that was two years ago this may
i seen her just the other day

jockin mike d to my dismay

girls - to do the dishes
girls - to clean up my room
girls - to do the laundry
girls - and in the bathroom

girls - thats all i really want is girls
two at a time i want girls
with new wave hairdos i want girls
i ought to whip out my girls girls girls girls girls
