ah yeah
i looked out the window seen his bald head
ran to the fridge and pulled out an egg
scoped him with my scopes he had no hair
launched that shot and he was caught out there

saw the convertible driving by
loaded up the slingshot let one fly
he went for his to find he didnt have one
put him in check correct with my egg gun

the egg a symbol of life
i go inside your house and bust out your wife
i pulled out the jammy he thought it was a joke
the trigger i pulled his face the yoke

reached in his pocket took all his cash
left my man standing with an egg moustache
suckers they come a dime a dozen
when i say dozen you know what im talking about boy

yea thats right im the egg man
driving around
king of the town hey
always got my windows rolled down
ready to throw
you know im the egg man

once upon a time
egg man

humpty dumpty was a big fat egg
he was playing the wall then he broke his leg
tossed it out the window three minutes hot
hit the rastaman he said bloodclot

which came first the chicken or the egg
i egged the chicken and then i ate his leg
riding the trains in between cars
when i pull out the station youre gonna get yours

drive-by eggings plaguing la
yo they just got my little cousin ese
sometimes hard boiled sometimes runny ray
comes from a chicken not a bunny dummy

people laugh its no joke
my names yauch and im throwing the yoke
now they got me in a cell but i dont care
it was then that i caught catching people out there

up on the roof in my car up all night
im going through science like dolemite
the mack who
im the egg man taxi driver 
im the egg man
egg man egg man

we all dressed in black
we snuck up around the back
we began to attack
the eggs did crack on hazes back

sam i am down with the program
green eggs and ham yosemite sam
come halloween you know i come strapped
i throw it at a sucker k-pap

you made the mistake and judge a man by his race
you go through life with egg on your face
woke up in the morning peculiar feeling
looked up and saw egg dripping from the ceiling

families punk rocks the businessman
ill dog anybody with an egg in my hand
not like the crack that you put in a pipe
but crack on your forehead heres a towel now wipe

egg man egg man egg man egg man egg man egg man
egg man egg man egg man egg man egg man egg man
egg man egg man egg man egg man egg man
egg man
