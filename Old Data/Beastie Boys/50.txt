some static started in the pool hall
hit a motherfuckers face with the cue ball
then i met this girl she tried to gank me
so i smacked her in the booty with a plank bee

cause me and my crew were out breakin windows
the bingo the lotto you know ill never win those
possession is half the law
i had my routines before all yall

your whole life is comin apart at the seams
you aint nothing but a car thief biting routines
see im a city slicker i aint no townie
right now i wish i had another hash brownie

like ricky always said youve got to toke and pass
or mookies gonna kick your motherfuckin ass
you try to take what isnt yours like a god damn rat
see i personally i wouldnt even wanna go out like that

im a writer a poet a genius i know it
i dont buy cheeba i grow it
im a farmer
people always trying to get next to me
i had a beautiful experience on ecstasy

i smoked up a bag of elephant tranquilizer
because i had to deal with a money hungry miser
had a caine filled kool with my man rush rush
saw my teeth fall in the sink when i started to brush

you be doing nose candy on the bowie coke mirror
my girl asked for some but i pretended not to hear her
you cant deny me you always want to try me
yo youre just gonna get your ass kicked

homeboy throw in the towel
your girl got dicked by ricky powell
the godfather of soul in the belly of the beast
smokin that dust at st anthonys feast

all the wife beaters and all the tax cheaters
sitting in the white house pulling their peters
buy my cheeba from the cop down the street
the only cop with a rope chain with the walking the beat

so like a sneaky pouch time bomb tickin
like the beat to my rhyme just kickin
space cake cookies i discover who i am
im a dusted old bummy hurdy gurdy man

five-o caught me now im going to the mountains
said good-bye to my girl my lawyers and accountants
my mind is kinda rhymin and i think i oughta think
so im rockin all the rhymes and ill have another drink

so the lights are flashing my mind is spinning
i feel like it is always the beginning
of another rhyme im rappin mcin i rock
you aint nothing but a car thief who must be stopped
