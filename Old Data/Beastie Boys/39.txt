cause im a high plains drifter and im the drifter
the high plains drifter and im the drifter
they cant catch me they never gonna find me
theyre never gonna know that im the high plains drifter

pulled over to the river to take a rest
pulled out a pair of pliers and pulled the bullet out of my chest
fear and loathing across the country listening to my 8 track
i reached behind the seat to snatch a cool one from the pack

a long distance from my girl and im talking on the cellular
she said that she was sorry and i said yeah the hell you were
check the rear view mirror check the gold tooth display
check the odometer and i was on my way

cause im the high plains drifter the best that you can get
a strapped shoplifter a pirate on cassette
bust a travis bickle when i feel that im getting pushed
dont step to me cause youre gonna get mushed sinister

im doin 120 plowing over mail boxes
radar detector to tell me where the cops is
spend another night at the motel 6
its five dollars extra get the porno flicks and then i

concoct a black and tan in my brandy snifter
im a kleptomaniac k-mart shoplifter
cash flow getting low so i had to pull a job
i found a nice place to visit but a better place to rob

i left my car outside and the engine still revvin
time to get busy takin care of business at 7-eleven
and then i went inside to make my withdrawal
i saw all that he had but i had to take it all

knucklehead deli tried to gyp me on the price
so i clocked him off the turban with the bag of ice
cause im mellow like jell-o cool like lemonade
i made my getaway and then i thought that i had it made

i feel like steve mcqueen a former movie star
look in my rearview mirror seen a police car
ballantine quarts with the puzzle on the cap
i couldnt help to notice i was caught in a speed trap

dirty mary crazy larry on the run from dirty harry
stash the cash in the dash but my gun i did carry
im seeing blue and red flashing deep in the night
i got my alibi straight and i pulled over to the right

the cop knocked on my window and said boy wheres the fire
youve got a mailbox on your bumper and a bald front tire
outta the car longhair your goose is cooked
read me my rights fingerprinted and booked

makin like a dt driving a gran fury
wherever i hang my hats my home and my past is kind of blurry
every dog will have its day and mine will be in front of a jury
im the high plains drifter you know im never in a hurry

read me my rights as if i didnt know this
threw me in the tank with the drunk called otis
with his five o clock shadow he smelled of 3-day old beer
my man turned to me and said why are you here

i said im charmin im dashing im rental car bashin
phony paper passing at nix check cashing
i went before the judge he sent me to the brooklyn house of d
he said you behave or well throw away the key

houdinid out the cuffs i kicked the screw in the knee
i took the bailiffs wallet and went straight to otb
i had a good feeling easy come easy go
i bet on one horse to win and another to show

and sure enough that nag came in
brought my ticket to the window and collected my win
and then i broke into my new car with a wire coat hanger
hot wired hot wheeled and suzy is a headbanger
