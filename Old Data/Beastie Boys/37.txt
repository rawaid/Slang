now here we go dropping science dropping it all over
like bumping around the town like when youre driving a range rover
expanding the horizons and expanding the parameters
expanding the rhymes of sucker mc amateurs

and naugels isaac newton and scientific ez
ah ben franklin with the kite ah gettin over with the key
now rock shocking the mic as many times times the times tables
rock well to tell dispel all of the old fables

cause ive been dropping the new science
and ive been kicking the new knowledge
an mc to a degree that you cant get in college

now the dregs of the earth and the eggs that i eat
ive got pegs through my hands and one through my feet
shea stadium the radium e m d squared
kicked out of the palladium you think that i cared

its the sound of science
the sounds of science
science

rope a dope
the newest in new
right up to your face and dis you
waxin and milkin
all of yall square heads

time and money for girls covered with honey
you lie and aspire to be as cunning
reeling and rockin and rollin b size d cup
order the quarter deluxe why dont you wake up

my mind is kinda flowin like an oil projector
had to get up to get the jimmy protector
went berserk and worked and exploded
she woke up in the morning and her face was coated

buddy you study the man on the mic
d do what you like huh d
well drunk a skunk am i from the celebration
to peep that freak unique penetration

well i figured out who makes the crack
its the suckers with the badges and the blue jackets
a professor of science cause i keep droppin it
i smell weed cause yall be packin

and people always asking whats the phenomenon
yo whats up yo whats goin on
no one really knows what im talking about
yeah thats right my names yauch

ponce de leon constantly on
the fountain of youth not robotron
peace is a word ive heard before
so move and move and move upon the dance floor

cause im gonna die gonna die one day
cause im goin and goin and goin this way
not like a roach or a piece of toast
im goin out first class aint goin out coach

rock my adidas never rock fila
i do not sniff the coke i only smoke the sinsemilla
well with my nose i knows and with my scopes i scope
what i live i write and that is strictly rope

ive got science for any occasion
postulating theorems formulating equations
well cheech wizard in a snow blizzard
eating chicken gizzards with a girl named lizzy

droppin science like galileo dropped the orange
