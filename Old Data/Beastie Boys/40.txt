riddle me this brother can you handle it
your style to my style you cant hold a candle to it
equinox symmetry and the balance is right
smokin and drinkin on a tuesday night

its not how you play the game its how you win it
i cheat and steal and sin and im a cynic
for those about to rock we salute you
the dirty thoughts for dirty minds we contribute to

i once was lost but now im found
the music washes over and youre one with the sound
who shall inherit the earth the meek shall
and yo i think im starting to peak now al

and the man upstairs i hope that he cares
if i had a penny for my thoughts id be a millionaire
were just 3 mcs and were on the go
shadrach mesach abednego

only 24 hours in a day
only 12 notes well a man can play
music for all and not just one people
and now were gonna bust with the putney swope sequel

more adidas sneakers than a plumber got pliers
got more suits than jacoby &amp; meyers
if not for my vices and my bugged out desires
my year would be good just like goodyears tires

so im out pickin pockets at the atlantic antic
and nobody wants to hear you cause your rhymes are damn frantic
i mix business with pleasure way too much
you know wine and women and song and such

i dont get blue i gotta mean red streak
you dont pay the band your friends and thats weak
get even like steven like pulling a rambo
well shadrach mesach abednego you know

steal from the rich and im out robbing banks
give it to the poor and i always give thanks
because i got more stories than jd got salinger
i hold the title and you are the challenger

ive got money like charles dickens
i got the girlies in the coupe like the colonels got the chicken
always go out dapper like harry s truman
im madder than mads alfred e neuman

*never gonna let them say that i dont love you*

well my noggin is hoggin all kinds of thoughts
adam yoggin is yauch and hes rockin of course
smoke the holy chalice got my own religion
rally round the stage and check the funky dope musicians

like jerry lee swaggert or jerry lee falwell
you love mario andretti cause he always drives his car well
vicious circle of reality since the day you were born
and we love the hot butter on what the popcorn

sippin on wine and mackin
rockin on the stage with all the hands clappin
ride the wave of fate it dont ride me homes
*being very proud to be an mc*

and the man upstairs i hope that he cares
if i had a penny for my thoughts id be a millionaire
amps and crossovers under my rear hood
because the bass is bumpin from the back of my fleetwood

they tell us what to do hell no
