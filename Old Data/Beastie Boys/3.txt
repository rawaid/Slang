no sleep till brooklyn

foot on the pedal never ever false metal
engine running hotter than a boiling kettle
my job aint a job its a damn good time
city to city im running my rhymes

on location touring around the nation
beastie boys always on vacation
itchy trigger finger but a stable turntable
i do what i do best because im willing and able

aint no faking your money im taking
going coast to coast to watch all the girlies shaking
while youre at the job working nine to five
the beastie boys at the garden cold kickin it live

no sleep till--

another plane another train
another bottle in the brain
another girl another fight
another drive all night
our managers crazy he always smokes dust
hes got his own room at the back of the bus

tour around the world you rock around the clock
plane to hotel girls on the jock
were trashing hotels like its going out of style
getting paid along the way cause its worth your while

four on the floor ad-rocks out the door
mcas in the back because hes skeezin with a whore
we got a safe in the trunk with money in a stack
with dice in the front and brooklyns in the back

no sleep till--
no sleep till brooklyn
no sleep till brooklyn

aint seen the light since we started this band
mca get on the mic my man

born and bred brooklyn usa
they call me adam yauch but im mca
like a lemon to a lime a lime to a lemon
i sip the def ale with all the fly women

got limos arena tv-shows
autograph pictures and classy hos
step off holmes get out of my way
taxing little girlies from here to la
waking up before i get to sleep
cause ill be rockin this party eight days a week
