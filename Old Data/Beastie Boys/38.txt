yes yes yall - you dont stop
you keep it on - and shockin the place

well im mca i got nothing to prove
pay attention - my intention is to bust a move
i drink quarts and cans and bottles and sixes
between the turntables keep the vodka and the mixes

im mike d i got the deuces wild
a list of girlies numbers that ive dialed
i do the smurf the popeye and the jerry lewis
i like bullwinkle but i dont like moose

im schoolin in the boys room coolin by the locker
all the girls in class know that im the cool rocker
punk in the hall man i should of oughtta hit him
had the fresh rhymes and the kid cold bit em

smokin in the boys room is what i do best
while you were at a party your girlfriend fessed
i keep a pistol in my pocket so you better be cautious
fly around the world but it makes me nauseous

mike ds day off everyday of the week
i got to the party and i did the freak
i got a girl in the castle and one in the pagoda
you know i got rhymes like abe vigoda

im a def manhattan killer a rhyme driller
a mike in my hand and a mouth full of miller
i got a hat not a visor i drink budweiser
the turntables up on the drum riser

the needles in the groove and the vinyls on the platter
i know that im fly man theres no need to flatter
i travel around the globe its keeping girlies dizzy
my names mike d now watch me get busy yall

youre a fake wearin sucker whose gold got rusted
cheaper than a hot dog with no mustard
you tried to steal my fresh and you got cold busted
because your crews all soft and im disgusted

im from downtown from the city of manhattan
i got a lotta girlies and not ones cattin
my posses in effect and were doin the do
and we got more rhymes than your whole damn crew

caught you poppin that weak and you mustve been dusted
dusted dusted dusted
stuck you head in the toilet and stone cold flushed it
flushed it flushed it flushed it word
