and i beat a body down with an aluminum bat
a lot of people they be jonesin just to hear me rock the mic
theyll be staring at the radio staying up all night

so like a pimp im pimpin
i got a boat to eat shrimp in
nothing wrong with my leg just b-boy limpin
got arrested at the mardi gras for jumping on a float
my man mcas got a beard like a billy goat

oowah oowah is my disco call

and ill be busting routines and rhymes all night

like eating burgers and chicken and youll be picking your nose

disco bag schlepping and youre doing the bump
*shake your rump*
