all you trekkies and tv addicts
dont mean to dis dont mean to bring static
all you klingons in the fucking house
grab your backstreet friend and get loud

blowin doors off hinges
grab you with the pinchers
and no i didnt retire
ill snatch you up with the needle nose pliers

like mutual of omaha
with the ill boat youve never seen before
gliding in the glades
and like lorne greene you know i get paid

like caprese with the basil
not goofy like darren or hazel
im a motherfucking nick at night
with classics rerunning that you know all right

now remain calm no alarm
cause my farm aint fat so whats up with that
ive got friends and family that i respect
when i think im too good they put me in check

so believe when i say im no better than you
except when i rap so i guess it aint true

method of controlling my mind
like einstein and the rappin duke combined

some call it salugi some hot potato

mca grab the mic before the mic goes stale
