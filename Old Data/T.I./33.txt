i wonder would it matter much
if i never fucked and i just fell in love
or maybe if i never fell in love and i just fucked
i swear man shit was simpler when i was sellin drugs
you aint know me then though aint that what ya think
you was in the bed i was trafficking the thing
man after everything we will never be the same
man im tired of tellin lies know you sick of playin games
i remember you got a tattoo put my name on it
put you in a wedding dress with a train on it
i went and spent a whole mil just to go chill
in miami and i be damned if she dont know my love real
how dare you compare me to dude girl chill
my piece so close up on it you dont see what it is
