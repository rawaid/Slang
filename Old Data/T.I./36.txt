i say still i stand
hey shorty here i am

never have ya seen in ya lifetime
a more divine southern rapper with a swagga like mine
facin all kind of time but smile like im fine
brag with such passion and shine without tryin
believe me pains a small thing to a giant
i was born without a dime out the gutter i climbed
spoke my mind and didnt stutter one time
ali say even the greatest gotta suffer sometime
so i huff and puff rhymes lyrics so sick wit it
set the standard in atlanta how to get get get it
so you up-and-coming rappers wanna diss just kill it
im officially the realest point blank period
whether i still live in the hood or just visit
whatever you can do in the hood i done did it
that why the dope boys and the misfits feel it
this still the city long as tip livin nigga

i aint dead nah i aint done nah
i aint scared of what i aint run from who
but still i stand yeah
no matter what people here i am yeah
no matter what remember
i aint break never i aint fold never
they hate me more so and yeah i know ha ha
but here i go yeah
no matter what shorty here i go ha
no matter what shorty

you let the blog sites and the magazines tell it
im sure to be in jail till 2027
rather see me in the cell than instead of this new mclaren
god will take you to hell just to get you to heaven
so even though its heavy the load i will carry
grin is still bear it win and still share it
apologies to the fans i hope you can understand it
life can change your directions even when ye aint planned it
all you can do it handle it worst thing you can do is panic
use it to your advantage avoid insanity manage
to conquer every obstacle make impossible possible
even when winnings illogical losings still far from optional
ay yeah they wanna see you shot up in the hospital
but when life throw punches block and counter like a boxer do
been locked inside mi casa too long i did a song
to make it known that the king lives on pimpin

i aint dead nah i aint done nah
i aint scared of what i aint run from who
but still i stand yeah
no matter what people here i am yeah
no matter what remember
i aint break never i aint fold never
they hate me more so and yeah i know ha ha
but here i go yeah
no matter what shorty here i go ha
no matter what shorty

even in solitude theres still no hotter dude
i show you how to do what you do ya aint got a clue
all you do is follow dudes sound like a lotta dudes
ill weather whatever storm make it out without a bruise
i understand why now when my hands tied
they take shots cause if im out there its a landslide
but revenge is best served as a cold dish
and suckas will get served nigga
guess it was understood for me it was over with
but i dont quit if ye aint noticed yet
they couldnt wait to say goodnight shorty
so they can try to rhyme act and look like shorty
go get a beat from toomp and make a hook like shorty
fore you know it im back what it look like shorty
i lost my partner and my daughter in the same year
somehow i rise above my problems and remain here
yeah and i hope the picture painted clear
if your heart filled with faith then you cant fear
wonder how i face years and im still chillin
easy let go and let god deal with it

i aint dead nah i aint done nah
i aint scared of what i aint run from who
but still i stand yeah
no matter what people here i am yeah
no matter what remember
i aint break never i aint fold never
they hate me more so and yeah i know ha ha
but here i go yeah
no matter what shorty here i go ha
no matter what shorty
