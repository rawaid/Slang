nevermind what haters say ignore em til they fade away
amazing they ungrateful after all the game i gave away
safe to say i paved the way for you cats to get paid today
you still be wastin days away now had i never saved the day

consider them my protégé homage i think they should pay
instead of being gracious they violate in a major way
i never been a hater still i love em in a crazy way
some say they sold the yay and no they couldnt get work on labor day

it aint that black or white it has an area the shade of gray
im west side anyway even if i left today and stayed away
some move away to make a way not move away cause they afraid
i brought back to the hood and all you ever did was take away

i pray for patience but they make me wanna melt they face away
like i once made em spray now i could make them put the ks away
been thuggin all my life cant say i dont deserve to take a break
you rather see me catch a case then watch my future fade away

youre gonna be a shining star
with fancy clothes and fancy cars
and then you see youre gonna go far
cause everyone knows who you are

im the opposite of moderate immaculately polished with
the spirit of a hustler and the swagga of a college kid
allergic to the counterfeit impartial to the politics
articulate but stilld grab a nigga by the collar quick

whoever havin problems with they record sales just holla tip
if that dont work and all else fails then turn around and follow tip
i got love for the game but ay im not in love with all of it
could do without the fame and rappers nowadays are comical

the hootin and the hollerin back and forth with the arguin
where you from who you know what you makin what kind of car you in
seems as though you lost sight of whats important when depositin
them checks into ya bank account and youve up out of poverty

your values is in disarrayed prioritizin horribly
unhappy with the riches cause youre piss-poor morally
ignorin all prior advice and forewarnin
and we mighty full of ourselves all of a sudden arent we

youre gonna be a shining star
with fancy clothes and fancy cars
and then you see youre gonna go far
cause everyone knows who you are

so live your life hey ay-ay-ay
you steady chasin that paper
just live your life oh ay-ay-ay
aint got no time for no haters

just live your life hey ay-ay-ay
no telling where itll take ya
just live your life oh ay-ay-ay
cause im a paper chaser

just livin my life ay my life oh my life ay 
just livin my life ay my life oh my life ay 

got everybody watchin what i do
come walk in my shoes
and see the way im livin if you really want to
got my mind on my money and im not goin nowhere

so keep on gettin your paper and keep on climbin
and look in the mirror and keep on shinin
til the game end til the clock stop
we gon post up on the top spot

livin the life my life
in a brand new city got my whole team wit me
the life my life i do what i wanna do
im livin my life my life i will never lose
im livin my life my life and im not stopping

so live your life
