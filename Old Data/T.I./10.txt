the-dream
we said wed never be
just a memory
and even though it breaks my soul
still i never let your heart go

were running way too fast
chasing down that blue grass
hope i didnt break your soul
and know i never let your heart go

aight man remember all a nigga had
with 20 grand cash it was all in the bag
and we got it all with the crack
lookin for the plug in the mall with the gat
no you never loan me a pair but he loan me a ride with it all in the back
how could you just call me with that
acting like you think you gettin all of it back
still remember standin all alone in the trap
waitin on a plate lookin for a way
and damn a big car pull up on me one day
got a homie []
huh and its been long since then
damn cant believe you been gone since then
huh i really miss my nigga
tramel [] this for you know you up there nigga

ay and if anyone seen where i made it today probably really one thing
one 12 in the face no he finna run games
aint gon trick me into sayin one name
nope well go sit in the cell about that
for weeks i was mad in a hell about that
police sayin shit really wasnt my shit
it was his and he knew i wasnt playin bout that
hey for every time im strapped
the 12 ride by they aint finding my strap
judge woulda had a nigga heart by that
a nigga woulda sensed some blood by that
