everyone thinks that i have it all
but its so empty living behind these castle walls
these castle walls

if i should tumble if i should fall
would anyone hear me screaming behind these castle walls
theres no one here at all behind these castle walls

observing the estate through the gate from the outside looking in
bet you would think i got it made better look again
i got a butler got a maid and a mansion
the belief is that im living out a millionaires fantasy

with phantoms and ferraris in the driveway
but you see the pain and the change of the same mans sanity
your vision jaded by the grammys on the mantelpiece
just switch your camera lenses you would see the agony

apparently its damaging the man you see before
you on the canvas he may seem alright but all the disadvantages
his family encounters overshadows his extravagance
walk in my nines awhile i dare you i scare you

while it really seem like the kings life seem glamorous
as seen through the eyes of untrained amateurs
because the cameras dont see beyond the walls of the smiles
only counts until it falls in the pile

honestly to me i think id lose every benefit
of all that ive accomplished if my kids never win at shit
me knowing this why should the verses i have laid
be more important to me than the persons i have raised

i guess im saying that to say that opportunity
but they just dont equate to all the time they take away
from the kids all the shit i did right is a mistake
if deyjah end up a stripper and major out there slinging yay

how could i ever consider myself a great
if messiah aint paid and nique nique aint straight
would your favourite song about the whips money and shit
be relevant if you found out the money wasnt real nope

so me being the goat shouldnt mean more to me
than see it to a king though
from a bad ass kid to man with some dough
otherwise i may well have stayed poor

so while they stay focused on me beefin with flip
shawty low gucci or ludacris or if im fucking with a hoe
did i snitch when i got arrested or will i die over nonsense
internally im dealing with this conflict

so excuse me if i dont get the chance to kiss the hand
or slap me in the face ay im just the man
if they saying i aint the best at making hit records
its cause this my life these aint just rapping

shit you think of that deep did ya dawg
see you cant see the castle through the walls till it falls
bitch aint thinking with the deep did ya dog
cause see you cant see the castle through the walls till it falls

nobody knows im all alone
living in this castle made of stone
they say that money is freedom
but i feel trapped inside it all

and while i sit so high up on a throne
i wonder how i can feel this low

on top of the world its beautiful
but theres no place to fall

for the record ay i could give a damn if i never sell shit again
my career was meant for me to come and tell it
honest interpretation of how affected im faced with
matters most rappers used to keep locked away in the basement

the day that i walk i aint saying that im amazing
down playing the way i keep fellas from catching cases
wont take into consideration how much it mean what im saying
and when i say what i mean even when im sorrounded by the fakers

from one of the greatest centers blessed with most of gods graces
who made his way amongst the greatest from the grimiest places
so next time you rating royalty
im always being given to recordings than the level of your loyalty

obvious youve been ignoring me
who else ya seen make it through the storm unharmed this charming
while all the critics was looking for prince charming
disregarded the king of the south raised doubt

even though he made a castle out of used to be a house
he did shit that all your favorites rappers only rap about
but most of yall dont see the castle through the walls
and the smiles till it falls in piles so while
