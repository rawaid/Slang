atl westside thats the only home i know
in 85 me and uncle quint used to ride around in the big bronco
took me up to charles disco
daytime set me down at the bar
where i drank shirley temple
til he walked out with a bag and we got back in the car
what you wanna be he asked when you grow up big kid
i just wanna be like you ridin round town gettin bread
we shot a couple lac couple summer pass
uncle quint aint nowhere to be found
later we learn that someone ratted him out
for that reason 10 years he wont be around

drinkin henney up out the bottle

family dont think ill live to see tomorrow
plenty have a story like mine
know many of you had a little nine
know many of you did a little dirt
too many of us did a little time
wake up 10 years of your life passed
when you get your cake up
dont it seem like that
when the feds on your ass passin out
