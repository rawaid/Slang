tell me why it is now that we live only for the moment
erybody going deeper to the dark
point of no return following the evil running from the lord
hatred in the heart
poison [] a nigga use to play and trade toys with a nigga
now you gotta go to war with a nigga
just because you got more than a nigga
motherfucker kamikaze you they rather die then see you live fly
crabs in a barrel in ghetto america
man we just lucky that we make it out
see so much potential lost some reputation you would think eventually we will get it
they say you got it they dont even want it
it just hurt so much for them to see you with it
what i know bout satan he patiently wait
to rob and steal and kill off greatness in the making
what we put together never let em take it
