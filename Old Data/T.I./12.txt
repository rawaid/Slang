you say this the home of the brave i guess
i say this the home of the ks and the vets
all alone with the js smoking yay cause he stressed
on chrome with a tec taught to spray for respect
i learned from the best used to stay in the jects
bought work from the vets burning rubber in the vettes
this as good as it gets used to play with the rats
then i got older and learned stay away from the rats
god blessed this nigga to hustle up and make eight figures
turned from a goon to a great young nigga
no complaining just doing what it take young nigga
i was raised in a decade of hate young nigga
always dodging polices because they hate young niggas
and we hate them too 38 in him shoe
all the changes the system will take him through
he aint a killer but he will if you make him do it
homicide hell ride theyll put him on trial
let him have a life sentence then do it with a smile
and he only 19 he aint even had a child
as a child told his mama hell be gone for a while
and she cried still they just put him inside
now she all on her own because her other son died
listen to the politician as he lied and he lied
he a snake in a suit trying to hide in disguise

live by the gun never run from a fight
trayvon in a hoodie walking through the neighborhood he
didnt do shit to buddy he didnt have to die did he
i guess its because his dad was a judge in the city
they didnt want him in the pen with the thugs that could get him
a jury of his peers said all was forgiven
but touch one of mine right or wrong imma kill them
fill them with the lead like they put in martin luther kings head
like they killed malcolm x edgar hoover did that
