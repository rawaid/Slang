ever had one of them days you wish you wouldve stayed home
run into a group of niggas who gettin they hate on
you walk by they get wrong
you reply then shit get blown
way outta proportion way past discussion
just you against them pick one then rush em
figure you get jumped here thats next
so they dont wanna stop there now they bustin
now you gushin ambulance rushin
you to the hospital with a bad concussion
plus youre hit 4 times bullet hit your spine
paralyzed waist down now ya wheelchair bound
never mind that now you lucky to be alive
just think it all started you fussin with three guys
now your pride in the way but your pride is the way
you could fuck around get shot die any day
niggas die everyday
all over bullshit dope money dice game ordinary hood shit
could this be cos of hip hop music
or did the ones with the good sense not use it
usually niggas dont know what to do when their back against the wall so they just start shootin
for red or for blue or for blow i guess
from bankhead or from your projects
no more stress now im straight now i get it now i take
time to think before i make mistakes just for my familys sake
that part of me left yesterday
the heart of me is strong today
no regrets im blessed to say
the old me dead and gone away

i aint never been scared i lived through tragic situations
couldve been dead lookin back at it
most of that shit didnt even have to happen
but you dont think about it when you out there trappin
in apartments hangin smokin and rappin
niggas start shit next thing you know we cappin
get locked up then didnt even get mad
now i think about damn what a life i had
most of that shit look back just laugh
some shit still look back get sad
maybe my homeboy still be around
had i not hit the nigga in the mouth that time
i won that fight i lost that war
i can still see my nigga walkin out that door
who wouldve thought id never see philant no more
got enough dead homies i dont want no more
cost a nigga his job cost me more
i had done took that ass whippin now for sure
now think before i risk my life
take them chances to get my stripe
a nigga put his hands on me alright
otherwise stand there talk shit all night
cos i hit you and you sue me
i shoot you get locked up who me
no more stress now im straight now i get it now i take
time to think before i make mistakes just for my familys sake
that part of me left yesterday
the heart of me is strong today
no regrets im blessed to say

i dont see nobody by my side
i turn my head to the west
