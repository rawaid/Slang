[intro dr tc]
tyler you obviously have some fucking problems
and this is the end of this session lets anything else youve gotta say

[verse 1]
mom is getting jealous i see my manager more
than i see her before i go on tour and it hurts
i miss the days when this was fun but now it turned into work
they getting legal so now i gotta watch the shit that i blurt out
my friends are turning into opposites
because my life is turning into opposite of sloppy wrist
and all the bitches who forget about me want to ride my dick
harder than the white kids that copy shit
ending it is all i fucking think about thats the shit i think about
all alone bawling til my mothafuckin eyes bleed
see hes a leader in person and smile shit gets disgursting
when theres no person around talking discussion shit man
fuck im putting myself at a distance
for instance my best friend is now my fucking assistant
niggas saying free earl without even knowin him
see theyre missing the new album im missing my only friend

[interlude]
when i say odd yall say future
odd uh-uh that shits corny as fuck
tyler you have a cult following
to these white kids

[verse 2]
charbroiled nigga on these dark beats
nashes with the nazis but its normal what the cops see
awesome at his concert but he never had a pop see
mommy was a living single queen with a lot tee
so while my wallets piling with symbolic colored paper
i lace her cause she gave me such a lot at such a young age
20 why didnt she get that abortion
probably cause that motherfuckin embryo was morphing
into a grammy winning schizophrenic fucking orphan
oops i meant bastard a skinny ass disaster
mom works hard still working on her masters
son lies about taking classes at community college
just to record some bullshit he calls bastard
start a fuckin cult clash his talents in a brash way
before he even had a mustache and cash
and all i got was a fuckin shitty article in thrasher

[interlude]
im not crazy im a fucking table im a fucking table

[verse 3]
im a grab the nina and find a nice arena
cause i cant even choose between ortega or suprema
and im not even human im a body shaped demon
with some semen in my sack and some problems in the back
and a life thats full of crap and a finger filled with hate
and a gat thats filled with love now let opposites attract
i can finally be one like a marriage in a church
but this marriage has a hearse and the parents of the one
thats getting married has a curse and its made up inside of him
too late to reimburse but wait it gets worse
all the guests thats in the church all decided to disperse
so there was nobody who could stop the wedding with converse
so they tied the knot now its too late to reverse
this arrangement yes it is and the nurse is amazed at the hurt
that he was painting but it was obvious in all the photos
he was paining now a bunch of whispering immerse

[outro]
and then the nurse blurts
what the fuck is his problem here we have two doses to give him here
why didnt anybody ask him first
ive been asking you this whole time
because nobody gave a fuck
someone gave a fuck tyler
and uh the person that gave a fuck was me
see youre not going crazy its me im your best friend tyler
i know everything i know everything about you
youve been helping yourself this whole time
your friends theyre just figments of your imagination
dr tc see tyler im your conscience
