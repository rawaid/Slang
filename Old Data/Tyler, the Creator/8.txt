now im the happiest i think ill ever ever be
my life is just like yours no father
my momma must have forgot to stop with a pop condom
in school i was the one thinking outside boxes
so everybody in them would say that i got problems
so when i heard you say it i said it back like fuck em
youre in inspiration to niggas like me

im talking about the niggas who dont know where theyre going to be
i heard the song bastard right in the moment of heat
not in summer but of course i was holding a heat
gun on the edge of my feet i heard first piano chord
and it drew me in like predators carrying treats
then i said to myself fuck is he speaking to me
