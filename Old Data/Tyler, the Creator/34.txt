i can grab the fireworks the soda all the cookies we can eat
make you nauseous but be cautious this is not dawsons creek
we could sneak away fuck it you could bring an eighth
im not gon smoke but im just asking baby —Åould you meet me by the lake
said bring a towel well baby meet me by the lake
bathing suit is going down shit just meet me by the lake
we could count the shooting stars well could you meet me by the lake
summer never has to end with me

[verse 1 hodgy]
im give it to her she wants that summer time
im give it like no other cause she knows im hers
damn right shes mine we both know it
so when we separate everything fine her phone ringin in her purse
damn right its me im her nigga nigga
come for mines in summer time imma bust that trigger nigga
catch us where the beach at she wanna go shopping
sun down after club cause she like to get it popping
sangria on my feet ma cause she likes to get it popping
no ecstasy for her but she wanna get it popping
drop topping i measure her pleasure
then drop in when she get out of place i quantinize
she is my concubine i am her porcupine
i poke her face her throat for taste give me head like im on her mind
i know her analyzation so when she try to fake
summer time in the boat of love meet me by the lake

[verse 2 tyler]
i packed a couple sandwiches inside that basket
and brought some extra towels if anyone was asking
we should take a dip in that lake quick and then split
then do something thats beyond what we both can imagine

watch the sunset we can watch the sunset
watch the sunset there goes the rainbow

[outro]
