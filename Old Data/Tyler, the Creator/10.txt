we are the sams and were dead its just four of us
we come in peace we mean no harm and were inglorious
we took their heads but we just took back what they took from us
i guess we lost ours

music had nothing to do with my final decision
i just really wanted somebody to come pay me attention
but nobody would listen but stuffed animals that i had
since i was a kid but im growing up so they missin
i didnt mean to hurt anybody im sorry
i wouldnt hurt a fly or consider joining the army
im hardly ever angry roger rabbit framed me
momma im the same fucking kid that you made see
i dont wanna go to jail i just wanna go home
and i want those fucking kids at school to just leave me alone
and i i hear helicopters make them dip
im fucking reloaded i told you all that i aint takin shit

ill pump it like my inhaler when asthma begin to act up
the difference between us and our class is tan khakis
i got 99 problems and all of them is being happy
