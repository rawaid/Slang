[intro]
so you tell me that everything just isnt going well
well first off

[verse 1]
my only problem is death
fuck heaven i aint showing no religion respect
brain damage therapys the only thing i regret
talking to me is like a fucking body missing her neck
but im surprised i aint pop off my top off
life is a bitch and my cocks soft the glocks cocked
my hands trembled my fingers slipped the walls red
her life is fucked she sad now her son is dead

[hook]
i told her im her worst nightmare
this is hell you dont ever gotta fight fair
my spirit floats around in the night air
or in your day dreams thats how death seems

[verse 2]
when i was younger i would smile a lot
im getting older getting bolder but a wiser top
now im drunk driving laps full of the budweiser tops
life is a movie and youre just a prop
they begged me to stop but i listen like death drones
love i dont get none thats why im so hostile to the kids that get some
my father called me to tell me he loved me
id have a better chance of getting taylor swift to fuck me
annoying and im ugly most niggas wanna punch me
im surprised the fucking doctor even touched me
feel like humpty you hoping that ill fall fuck yall
im ace im parentless im kinda arrogant
ignorant as fuck defend people for the hell of it
because i am the devil fucker get on my level
doughnuts and keys and kick-flips supremes and markers
my life is ms mo unique parker but a little darker ill see you in a couple

[hook]

[interlude]
tyler heres some water man
you seem a little tense how is thebe

[verse 3]
all because a nigga just dont give a fuck
parents wanna blame me all because their kid is fucking up
but fuck that youre shitty parents face it suck it up
thats what you shoulda did before that nigga bust huh
feel like i missed my little brother growing up
feel like my little brother missed his brother growing up
but this is golf wang like he missed his family growing up
i got a little taller since the last time you seen me bro
now im emo so fuck it im pouring up
but i never had a drink sydney tylers throwing up
my nigga jasper said if i drink and get drunk enough
i wont feel the feeling i be feeling when im sobered up
but thats a fucking lie why would he say that im
as emotionally strained as travis when hes tyler calm down
dont look at me im 65 about to fucking cry
about another guy but this is golf wang do or die
i finally had a family
domos in another state where the fuck is riley
now you niggas wanna be nice because the labels wanna sign me
but before the co-signing and you fuckers couldnt find me
fuck that i hope you die in a fiery death
one ear i got kids screaming of is the best
the other ear i got tron cat asking where the bullets and the bombs at
so i can kill these levels of stress shit
they say that im shock value
how about you hop off cock and turn volume down
i havent got around to telling my mom shit
cause i dont know how to whoa
all i want is her support whenever the fights at home
when mommy cusses out cousin some knifes get shown
now shes really fuckin pissed so the knives get thrown
and hit her in her fucking neck now her throats all gone
looking like a fucking monster from the twilight zone
then they wonder why i stay at travis pad with a backpack
for the whole week full of plastic-wrapped black tees
and deodorant like this house is my home
i could live with the same hat
and the same flat-screen tv watching flapjack
and the same bacon and waffles on a nice saturday
where i skate with the same fucking friends at
didnt give a fuck about fame or a name oh
message from gza oh another one from plain pat
email full of emails i never write back
aint kill myself yet now i already want my life back

[hook]

[verse 4]
one shot two shots one gun two cops
im blowin them flu shots couldnt kill me with two top rockers
youre on the side of faggots and cock blockers
im on the side of bad-ass kids and the top notches

cause im shrooming with the bangers and the carneys
