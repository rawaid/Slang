this is what the devil plays before he goes to sleep
some food for thought some food for death go head and fuckin eat
my fathers dead well i dont know well never fuckin meet
i cut my wrist and play piano cause im so depressed
somebody call the pastor this bastard is so posessed
this meetin just begun nigga im satans son

my mother raised me a single parent so its apparent
that i got love for my mother none of you other fuckas
are much important im gettin angrier while recordin
im feelin like the bulls ive got a gang of wolves
odd future is children thats fucked up on they mental
simple but probably not fuck em

im tall dark skinny my ears are big as fuck
drunk white girls the only way ill get my dick sucked
suspended from school coolest nigga without effort
easy to spot like black bitches with fake leopard
soak me up in a tampon but keep the lamp on
cause this album packs enough evil
that you cant fit inside a jansport go to school with this

i go from ap to jc inside of fuckin week
wakin up with random girls like yo bitch how the fuck we meet
i stay with grandma she always bitchin about her carpet
every time i walk inside the house she always tend to start shit
no to drugs i never spark it i used to be bullied for honour classes
by those slow as molasses take this shit to school

raquel treat me like my father like a fuckin stranger
she still dont know i made sarah to strangle her
not put her in danger and chop her up in the back of a wrangler
all because she said no to homecomin demons runnin
inside my head tellin me evil thoughts
im the dream catcher but nothin but nightmares i caught go to sleep

i wear green hats because im fortunately lucky
fuck me the monster said some how the monsters dead
inside of me but the thoughts it tells me are still evil
with this state of mind big moves max keeble
im on my grind feeble my music is evil
my fuckin samples are too illegal play this shit in church

i graduated without honors or a fuckin father
he died no bitch dont even fuckin bother
i wanted a brother my mother i told her
but instead i got a sister just like me with her mister nada
so both of our imaginations are creations of the fuckin situation
thats havin our brains racin like dayton wearin some fuckin heelies

i know you fuckin feel me i want to fuckin kill me
but times im so serious you think im silly
im doin big style willy couldnt touch 11
seven whats religion nigga i am legend
i roll with skaters and musicians with an intuition
i created of cause i feel were more talented
than 40 year old rappers talkin bout gucci
when they have kids they havent seen in years impressin their peers
with the same problem the only way to solve them
is to go to fathers day convention with a gold revolver
lifes a salad imma toss it eat that shit up rick ross it
shit it out bag it up sell it im so damn rebellious
cause my mother let me do what i want
she wasnt careless protective she is the bear
the shit is so bare my diary isnt hid
my father didnt give a fuck so its somethin i inherit
my moms all i have so its never meet the parents
when danielle or malonda decide to fuckin share
this confused boy i wanna hug all ya iâ€™m bad for you kids to listen to
soy is not the choice im bad milk drink it

my wrist is all red from the cutter
drippin cold blood like the winter the summer
is never thats equivalent to me and sarah
well thats not her fuckin name but i think this shit is clever
my niggas wanna know if im fuckin if im kissin
but im sittin here downin beers simply just wishin
with tear they try to tell me but i never listen
cause i dont give a shit like sittin down pissin
eighteen still talkin to imaginaries
hopefully they see the talent i carry just like jimmy
losers can never win me you can never offend me
my goal in life is a grammy hopefully momma will attend the
ceremony with all my homies im suicidal
this my zombie circus i hope the majors heard this
fuck a deal i just want my fathers email
so i can tell him how much i fuckin hate him in detail
