knock knock motherfucks its me mr clusterfuck
what when where how like who gives a fuck
golf wang m-o-b mopping niggas ante up
aint been this fucking sick since brain cancer ate my granny up
rest in peace allign it life aint got no light in it
darker than that closet that nigga frankie was hiding in
open it dope in it bobby wheres my fucking pipe
trust my little dick is aight twenty says i hit your wife
this is life truthfully i just want to fly some kites
grab salem and slater and go around ride bikes
get some ice cream golf wang rascals for the night
skate around and do annoying shit that older peeps despise
nigga fuck it though going hard as riggalo
got a nigga dollars and a couple crackers hit the show
cracked a couple kids in the head with this cast
had a blast out europe had a swedish bitch nigga hoes
thats how it goes; designing clothes cats on everything cats on everything
you think all this money will make a happy me
but im about as lonely as crackers that supermodels eat
everybodys sparking with me i keep coughing
cant keep calm in this spot hot box and im getting nauseous
hop in the car and write a song as im heading straight to the office
pissed at jasper because thats some faggot shit called pink dolphin

seei roll here on a mean unicorn
green hatvans golf top with the team uniform
tighten the kupris so im tying my bandana up
sunk them like the reds i forget it like dan manners cause
i am the cowboy on my own trip
and i am the cowboy on my own trip
and i am the cowboy on my own trip
and i am the cowboy on my own trip

but when youre alone thoughts start coming in
punching in that dark light box and they start rummaging
shit youve got to battle with wish that they could skedaddle
but it makes your shadow say none fuck it grab the gun again
i needed to get out of the house so i hit the dead sams and we were biking it out
in a black hoodiewith a arizona and a bag of skittles
just to see what all to see what all that fucking hype is about
now everytime you see a roach you think of me eh
because everytime i see one i think what his parents would say
in court saying i ate him i wasnt present that day
i was with whitney smoking sitting at the dock in the bay

i am the cowboy on my own trip
and i am the cowboy on my own trip
and i am the cowboy on my own trip
and i am the cowboy on my own trip

do you know how weird it is knowing i make a bunch of cheese
while my friends cant afford little pizzas from little ceasers
and their whole goal is to roll up and smoke bowls
so i dont feel bad when they not eating
but you still treating us you punk bitch
wolf haley got more methods than pink men
