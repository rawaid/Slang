[intro]
you wouldnt do that tyler kill yourself or anyone
you dont even have the balls to begin with
what you need is me someone to talk to
uh its been a while since our last session
so tell me whats been going on

[verse 1]
im not a fucking role model i know this
im a 19 year old fucking emotional coaster with pipe dreams
since kanye tweeted telling people hes bumping all of my shit
these mothafuckas think im supposed to live up to something shit
im still jacking off and proceeding my life careless
but getting more pussy cause i tell bitches im wood harris as you should
from philly to paris im getting these weird stares
at skateparks and airports all in the year its weird
yonkers dropped and left them craniums mindfucked
now competition missing like that nigga my mom fucked
he still hasnt called me yet thats not your fault
but thats a whole fucking different argument shit i got over it
and the couple bucks in my pocket so now i could go buy
a couple hot pockets and grandmom could stop cooking
them nasty ass collard greens pressures on me like this top hat
bastard intro how the fuck im gonna top that

[interlude]
okay you guys caught me
im not a fucking rapist or serial killer i lied

[tc]
we know you just want attention youll be fine

[verse 2]
i tried to hard huh
made a couple thou and i just dont know what to buy yet
the preme shit is free and i dont drink so fuck a wine set
nigga fuck a mindset my brain is an obscenity
fucked in the head i lost my mind with my virginity
oh thats a triple three six isnt he a devil worshiper
cause im too fucking ignorant to do some research
im the star of the group yeah
so no one else gets the respect that they deserve cause of you
bastard was good though what you think i record it for
to have a bunch a critics to call my shit a bunch of horrorcore
like i didnt make parade or inglorious
cause im too scared to tell my friends the way i really fucking feel
of course they only listen to lyrics about me pissin off
in the tombs of lara croft im getting pissed off
message boards are on my dick i need a pissing waiver
let me bust one in they mouth i know they feel the flavor

[tyler]
cant they just be happy for me
like a kid with nothing living out his dreams
why they got to fucking hate

[tc]
i think everyones happy everyones in a dream
i think youre _____ tyler you have to believe that

[tyler]
i aint even skate anymore im too fucking busy
i can barely kickflip now

[tc]
why why is that do you not have any free time on your hands

[tyler]
what the fuck you mean im not talented
you see the shit that ive been doing

[tc]
i have i mean youre a brave person

[tyler]
im not that great of a rapper but
as a whole im pretty cool right

[verse 3]
people excited thinking shit is so tight
getting co-signs from rappers that i dont even like
what the fuck you want me to do start to gobble his mic
and start jackson him off until his cocks blasting off
fuck that these niggas aint fucking with me
cause i dont listen to the immortal of tech of the nique
and all this underground bullshit thats never gon peak
on the billboard top 20 and jam of the week
id rather listen to badu and pusha the t
and some waka flocka flame instead of that real hip hop
thats bull of the sheet but they want to critique
everything that we wolf gang has ever released
but they dont get it they dont cause its not made for cause its not made for them
the nigga thats in the mirror rapping its made for him
but they do not have the mindset that same as him
im not weird youre just a faggot shame on him

[interlude]

and we just want to know whats the problem for this

[tyler]
i wish thebe was here

[verse 4]
therapys been sinning and niggas getting offended
they dont want to fuck with me cause i do not fuck with religion
you see thats my decision you fuckers dont have to listen
here put this middle finger in your ear id rather not
when someone gets blamed what cause some white kid had aimed his ak-47
at 47 kids i dont wanna see my name mentioned

[tc]
i dont think anyones going to mention
i dont think anyone takes you serious enough to believe you

[verse 5]
college wasnt working and i wasnt working
so i was at home jerking off until my dick was hurting
but i was determined to be great so those classes can wait
cause the four days that i went i wasnt learning shit
now im living dreams that i wanted since 8
i can afford to get my mother something on her birthday

[tc]
well you explained to me that you were in school but i

[verse 6]
they claim the shit i say is just wrong
like nobody has those really dark thoughts when alone
im just a teenager who admits hes suicide prone
my life is doing pretty good so that date is postponed for now
wow lifes a cute bitch full of estrogen
and when she gives you lemons nigga throw them at pedestrians

[tc]
sowhat are you saying take advantage
i mean youve been doing pretty good
ive seen that

[verse 7]
i still live in my grandmas house
sell out a fucking show in london just to end up on couches
i hate my fucking life but when i make that announcement
my hero calls my phone just to put that in doubt then
and then i am confused if i want in or just out
my friends really think im playing when i say i need counseling
i sit in grandmothers living room and just pout and shout loud
inside sometimes i just want to die

[tc]
no you dont

[tyler]
odd future came from the bottom
and its gonna take a couple armed armies trynna stop em
