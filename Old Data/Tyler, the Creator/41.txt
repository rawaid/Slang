i like my girls skinny with brains
i like my hoodies fucked with lane
i like my friends imaginary with no names
and i make music for the fuck of it no fame
aim shoot the gun of love round
tried to find ammo but its none around town
so i went down south but i ended up north
uptown sittin on cloud 9s white porch
and of course my cars off course
youre so white my blinkers dont work
im tryna let the force be with you i get you
music is my first but i contemplate divorce
you make a nigga sing songs nice
you make a niggas night turn day
and you make the flowers sing say turn green yellow
it sucks that i didnt get the chance to say hello
i wanna eat you out like jello
and mess with your body like the base and the cello
and tell your mom i said hello you wanna go to prom nigga hell no
fuck shit and another one and on another one

another love song about shit
and ill be rich if i get another diss
and maybe cupid wont miss

i like her l-i-k-e the only difference is she wont fuck with me
but she will fuck with that vegetable with the hairs full of xs and os
i wanna tie her body up and throw her in my basement
keep her there so nobody can wonder where her face went
tyler what you doin shut the fuck up
you gon fuckin love me bitch
but all i really want is a kiss on the cheek
in private not public in the streets
and your cupcake i will eat and your toes
cause i got a big fetish with the feet
i just want somebody i can see
you can be a gold digger you aint gotta love me
im serious i dont ask for much
your heart literally is what i do want for lunch
now this shit is turnin to a habit
im the burger king i gotta have it my way
and truthfully girl you really make my day
i would probably kill myself if you told me you was gay
and i cant even look the other way
your aura is a magnet my eyes a metal bag its attractive
l-o-l laughin youre a gold oscar and im just actin
and i want your sin in my hole and have our kids play supportin role
climbin up the pole jack and the beanstalk bitch its gold
and i was in loath i would never get over you ever sarah

another love song about shit
and ill be rich if i get another diss
and maybe cupid wont miss

half your body layin on my chest
the rest is in my stomach thats includin your breast
and imma just take another guess
now you probably wishin that you woulda said yes
am i crazy maybe but fucked up is how i been lately
shit i dont give a fuck your family lookin for you wish em good luck
bitch you tried to play me like a dummy
now you stuck up in my motherfuckin basement all bloody
and im fuckin your dead body your coochie all cummy
lookin in your dead eyes what the fuck you want from me
what did you want from me what did you want from me
