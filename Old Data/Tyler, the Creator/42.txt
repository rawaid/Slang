my father died the day i came out of my mothers hole
and left a burden on my soul until i was old enough
to understand that the fucking faggot didnt like me much
he loved my moms enough to bust a nut and then he shake junt
bring your pops to school today for twelve years i cheated
told the fucking faculty that he was at a meeting and
bring that dude to life day he wasnt at the meeting
made a u-turn on the way there like the fuck am i thinking
birthdays christmas my only fucking wishlist was cds and a father
and a new fitted instead i got some cds
i hated some ritalin some white socks
i was hyper because i didnt get attention from my real pops
cops say im supposed to be in jail but they dont know its me
statistics say that niggas with no father aint going to be shit

fathers day was the worst when it came to gifts
cause i aint know for who or what the fuck to get
now my momma mentioned the day before what she would like
cause shes playing both roles like her occupation was dyke fucking right
i aint look up to obama and nixon i look up to the hugos and dixons
the niggas in the vision rap about the shit they cooking in the kitchen
pushing keys like them niggas that were banging on the keys
my father never seen me the nigga probably stevie
he bought me a hoodie a couple albums
like thats going to make up for the years and the tears
and the money that my momma spent on rent and clothes
you fucking dipped out i swear to god if i see you
im a get out the m-16 and let a fucking clip out
cause in 16 years you let your kid down the existence none

the cold is nice and im not talking about the weather
the skin is thick no need for leather your father called
he said youre better without him im not the only fuck
without them how to tie a tie and how to get your suit hemmed up
take it to the shop then what
fuck it mommas proud of her asthmatic thin fuck
luck on my brim supreme keeps me warm
when the cold blood swarms in my veins fuck rain in the summer
the bummer is the fact that im black
and i hang with white neos whos nero stays frio
now this counselor is trying to tell me that im emo she dont give a fuck
d-low wheres the trigger ill let this bullet play hero bang
