puff daddy
yea though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death
i will fear no evil -- for you are with me
your rod and your staff they comfort me
you prepare a table for me in the presence of my enemies
you annoint my head with oil my cup overflows
surely goodness and love will follow me -- all the days of my life
and i will dwell in the house of the lord forever

notorious big
niggaz in my faction dont like askin questions
strictly gun testin coke measurin
givin pleasure in the benz-ito
hittin fanny spendin chips at mannys
hope you creeps got receipts my peeps get dirty like cleats
run up in your crib wrap you up in your polo sheets
six up in your wig piece nigga decease
mwa may you rest in peace
with my sycamore style more sicker than yours
four-four and fifty-four draw
as my pilot steers my leer yes my dear
shits official only the feds i fear
heres a tissue stop your blood clot cryin
the kids the dog everybody dyin no lyin
so dont you get suspicious
im big dangerous youre just a lil vicious
as i leave my competition respirator style
climb the ladder to success escalator style
hold yall breath i told yall -- death
controls yall big dont fold yall uhh

*chorus*
youre nobody til somebody kills you
i dont wanna die god tell me why
youre nobody til somebody kills you

uhh uhh
watch casino im the hip-hop version of nicky tarantino
ask nino he know
green with envy the green tempts me
to make the rich the enemy and take their cheese
take their spots take their keys make my faculty
live happily ever after in laughter
hah never seen cristal pour faster
and to those bastards knuckleheads squeeze lead
three of mine dead nuttin left to do
but tear they ass to shreds leave em in bloodshed
incidents like this i take trips
lay up in miami with tamika and tammy huh
some creole c-o bitches i met on tour
push a peach legend coupe gold teeth galore
told me meet em in the future later theyll take me shoppin
buy me lavender and fuschia gators
introduce me to playa haters and heavy weighters
rich bitch shit drinkin cristal
til they piss the shit uhh
thorough bitches adapt to any borough bitches
be in spots where they were no bitches you feel me
reminesce on dead friends too
youre nobody til somebody kills you

*chorus* 2x

uhh uhh
you can be the shit flash the fattest five thats right
have the biggest dick but when your shell get hit
you aint worth spit just a memory
remember he used to push the champagne range i remember that
silly cat all suede in the rain
swear he put the g in game had the gucci frame
before dana dane thought he ran with kane
i cant recall his name what was his name you mean that kid
that nearly lost half his brain over two bricks of cocaine
gettin his dick sucked by crackhead lorraine
a fuckin shame dukes a lame whats his name
darkskin jermaine see what i mean

*chorus* 2x fades
