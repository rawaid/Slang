chorus sung by notorious big repeat 2x

time time for you to die

notorious big
i make yo mouthpiece obese like della reese
when i release you loose teeth like lil cease
nigga please blood floods yo dungarees
and thats just the half on my warpath
laugh now cry later i rhyme greater
than the average playa hater and spectators
buy my cd twice; they see me in the streets
they be like yo he nice but thats on the low doe
be the cats with no dough tried to play me at my show
i pull out fo-fos and go up in they clothes
short-change niggaz snort-caine niggaz
extortion came quicker bought the range nigga
ya still tickle me i used to be as strong as ripple be
til lil cease crippled me
now i play hard like my girls nipples be
the game sour like like a pickle be yall know da rules
move from bk to new jeruz -- thinkin bout
all the planes we flew bitches we ran through
now the years new i lay my game flat
i want my spot back take two
motherfuckers mad cause i blew niggaz envious
too many niggaz on my dick shit strenuous
when my men bust you just move wit such stamina
slugs missed ya i aint mad at cha we aint mad at cha
blood rushin concussions aint nothin
catch cases come out frontin smokin somethin
sippin white russians bitch in the benz bumpin
i laced it wit the basic six tvs a system
knockin mase shit face it we hard to hit
guard ya shit fore i stick you for your re-up
wipe the pee up mixed shots woke your seed up
go in the ashtray spark the weed up long kiss

uhh im flamin gats aimin at these fuckin
maniacs put my name in raps what part the
game is that  like they hustle backwards
i smoke blackwoods and dutchies ya cant touch me
try to rush me slugs go touchy-touchy
youre bleedin lovely witchyo spirit above me
or beneath me your whole life you live sneaky
now you rest eternally sleepy you burn when you creep me
rest where the worms and the weak be
my nine flies baptize rap guys
with the holy ghost i put holes in most
you hold your toast shaky slippin tryin to break me
look what you made me do brains blew
my team in the marine-blue six coupe
skied it out weeded out cleanin out -- the block
for distances givin long kisses bitch

chorus 2x

{puff daddy - speaking over chorus}
all we have to do now is say a prayer for you yknow
thats all we have to do just to pray for your mind cause
eheh see your mind got control of your heart
when its supposed to be the other way around
your hearts supposed to got control of your mind
so now i have no feelings for you
you have made me cold
{last line overlaps biggies next verse}

notorious big
frank white the menacin chron chrons the medicine
i got the lettuce and you turn green like cucumber skin
got the new hummer in the summer when i was a new comer
then drugs and mac-10s
hugs from fake friends make ends they hate you
be broke -- girls wont date you
thats why i relate to choke yo ass out til your face blue
make you open the safe too
no matter how you call it how you call it
this brolic alcoholic  {*biggies chorus fades in*}
like his weed greend out like his brick solid
distribute to kids who take heart like valentine
drink ballentine all the time
slugs hit your chest tap you spine flatline
heard through the grapevine you got fucked fo times
damn that three to nine fucked you up for real doe
sling steal slow as for remorse we feel no

chorus 3x

{puff daddy - speaking over chorus}
