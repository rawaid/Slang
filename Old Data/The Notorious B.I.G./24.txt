prayin god forgive us for being sinners help us out

after realizin to master enterprisin
i aint have ta be in school by ten i was in
began to encounter wit my counter-parts
on how ta burn the block apart break it down into sections
drugs by the selection
some use pipes others use in-jec-tions
syringe sold seperately frank the deputy
quick to grab my smith-n-wessun like my dick was missin
to protect my position my corner my layer
while we out here say the hustlas prayer
if the game shakes me or breaks me
i hope it makes me a better man
take a better stand
put money in my moms hand
get my daughter this college plan so she dont need no man
stay far from timid
only make moves when ya hearts in it
and live the phrase skys the limit
motherfucker see you chumps on top
