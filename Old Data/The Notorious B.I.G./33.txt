didnt hesitate to squeeze to get my life out of danger yeah
one day she put nine one one on the page
had to call back whether its minor or major yeah
no response the phone just rung
grab my vest grab my gun to find out the problem
when i pulled up police was on the scene
had to make the u-turn make sure my sh*t was clean
drove down the block stashed the burner in the bushes
stepped to police with the shoves and the pushes
it didnt take long before the tears start
i saw my b*tch dead with the gunshot to the heart
and i know it was meant for me
i guess the niggaz felt they had to kill the closest one to me uh yeah
and when i find em your life is to and end
they killed my best friend me and my b*tch

chorus
