verse one

who shot ya
seperate the weak from the ob-solete
hard to creep them brooklyn streets
its on nigga fuck all that bickering beef
i can hear sweat trickling down your cheek
your heartbeat soun like sasquatch feet
thundering shaking the concrete
finish it stop when i foil the plot
neighbors call the cops said they heard mad shots
saw me in the drop three in the corner

slaughter electrical tape around your daughter
old school new school need to learn though
i burn baby burn like disco inferno
burn slow like blunts with llello
peel more skins than idaho potato
niggaz know the lyrical molestin is takin place
fuckin with big it aint safe
i make your skin chafe rashes on the masses
bumps and bruises blunts and landcruisers
big poppa smash fools bash fools
niggaz mad because i know that cash rules
everything around me two glock nines
any motherfucker whispering about mines
and im crooklyns finest
