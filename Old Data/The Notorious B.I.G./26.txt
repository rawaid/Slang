verse one notorious big

when the lala hits ya lyrics just splits ya
head so hard that ya hat cant fit ya
either im witcha or against ya
format venture back through that maze i sent ya
talkin to the rap inventor
nigga wit the game tight bic that flame right
spell my name right b-i double-g i-e
iced out lights out me and cease-a-leo
gettin head from some chick he know
see its all about the cheddar nobody do it better
going back to cali strictly for the weather
women and the weed -- sticky green
no seeds bitch please poppa aint soft
dead up in the hood aint no love lost
got me mixed up you drunk them licks up
mad cause i got my dick sucked
and my balls licked forfeit the game is mine
ima spell my name one more time check it
its the n-o t-o r-i o
u-s you just lay down slow
recognize a real don when you see juan/one
sippin on booze in the house of blues

chorus repeat 4x

im going going back back to cali cali

verse two notorious big

if i got to choose a coast i got to choose the east
i live out there so dont go there
but that dont mean a nigga cant rest in the west
see some nice breasts in the west
smoke some nice sess in the west yall niggaz is a mess
thinkin im gon stop givin la props
all i got is beef with those that violate me
i shall annihilate thee
case closed suitcase filled with clothes
linens and things i begin things
people start to flash 818s 213s
313s big
frequently floss hoes at roscoes
if i wanna squirt her take her to fatburger
spend about a week on venice beach
sippin crist-o with some freaks from frisco

chorus

verse three notorious big

cali got gunplay models on the runway
scream biggie biggie gimme one more chance
i be whippin on the freeway the nyc way
on the celly-celly with my homeboy lance
pass hash from left to right
only got five blunts left to light im set tonight
paid a visit to versace stores
bet she suck until i aint got no more only in la
bust on bitches be-lly rub it in they tummy
lick it say its yummy then fuck yo man
fuck your plan is it to rock the tri-state
almost gold 5 gs at show gate
or do you wanna see about seven digits
fuck hoes exquisite cali great place to visit

chorus
