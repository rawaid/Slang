fuck all yall hoes
get a grip motherfucker
yeah this album is dedicated
to all the teachers that told me id never amount to nothing
to all the people that lived above the buildings that i was hustling in front of
that called the police on me
when i was just trying to make some money to feed my daughter
and all the niggas in the struggle
you know what im saying
its all good baby baby

it was all a dream
i used to read word up magazine
salt n pepa and heavy d up in the limousine
hangin pictures on my wall
every saturday rap attack mr magic marley marl
i let my tape rock til my tape popped
smoking weed and bambu sipping on private stock
way back when i had the red and black lumberjack
with the hat to match
remember rappin duke duh-ha duh-ha
you never thought that hip hop would take it this far
now im in the limelight cause i rhyme tight
time to get paid blow up like the world trade
born sinner the opposite of a winner
remember when i used to eat sardines for dinner
peace to ron g brucey b kid capri
funkmaster flex lovebug starski wassup
im blowing up like you thought i would
call the crib same number same hood thats right
its all good its all good
and if you dont know now you know nigga

you know very well who you are
dont let em hold you down reach for the stars
you had a goal but not that many
cause youre the only one ill give you good and plenty

i made the change from a common thief
to up close and personal with robin leach
and im far from cheap i smoke skunk with my peeps all day
spread love its the brooklyn way
the moet and aliz√© keep me pissy
girls used to diss me
now they write letters cause they miss me
i never thought it could happen this rapping stuff
i was too used to packing gats and stuff
now honeys play me close like butter play toast
from the mississippi down to the east coast
condos in queens indo for weeks
sold out seats to hear biggie smalls speak
living life without fear
putting 5 karats in my baby girls ears
lunches brunches interviews by the pool
considered a fool cause i dropped out of high school
stereotypes of a black male misunderstood
and its still all good
uhand if you dont know now you know nigga

you know very well who you are
dont let em hold you down reach for the stars
you had a goal but not that many
cause youre the only one ill give you good and plenty

super nintendo sega genesis
when i was dead broke man i couldnt picture this
50-inch screen money green leather sofa
got two rides a limousine with a chauffeur
phone bill about two gs flat
no need to worry my accountant handles that
and my whole crew is lounging
celebrating every day no more public housing
thinking back on my one-room shack
now my mom pimps a ac with minks on her back
and she loves to show me off of course
smiles every time my face is up in the source
we used to fuss when the landlord dissed us
no heat wonder why christmas missed us
birthdays was the worst days
now we sip champagne when we thirst-ay
uh damn right i like the life i live
cause i went from negative to positive
and its all

its all good

and if you dont know now you know nigga
