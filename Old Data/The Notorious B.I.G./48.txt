i was a terror since the public school era
bathroom passes cuttin classes squeezing asses
smoking blunts was a daily routine
since thirteen a chubby nigga on the scene
i used to have the tre duce
and the duce duce in my bubblegoose
now i got the mack in my knapsack
loungin black smoking sacks up in acts
and sidekicks with my sidekicks rockin fly kicks
honeys want to chat
but all we wanna know is where the party at
and can i bring my gat
if not i hope i dont get shot
but i throw my vest on my chest
cause niggaz is a mess
it dont take nothin but frontin 
for me to start somethin
buggin and barkin at niggaz like i was duck huntin
dumbing out just me and my crew
cause all we wanna do is

chorus
bullshit  and party and x9

hugs from the honeys pounds from the roughnecks
seen my man sei that i knew from the projects
said he had beef asked me if i had my piece
sure do two 22s in my shoes
holler if you need me love im in the house
roam and strollin see what the honeys is about
moet popping hoe hopping aint no stopping big poppa im a bad boy
niggaz wanna front who got your back biggie
niggaz wanna flex who got the gat biggie
it aint hard to tell im the east coast overdoser
nigga you scared youre supposed to
nigga i toast ya put fear in your heart
fuck up the party before it even start
pissy drunk off the henny and stuff
or some brand-nubian shit beatin down punks

chorus

bitches in the back looking righteous
in a tight dress i think i might just
hit her with a little biggie 101 how to tote a gun 
and have fun with jamaician rum
conversations blunts in rotation
my man big jacques got the glock in his waist and
were smoking drinking got the hooker thinking
if money smell bad than this nigga biggie stinking
is it my charm i got the hookers eatin out my palm
she grabbed my arm and said lets leave calm
im hittin skins again
rolled up another blunt bought a heineken
niggaz start to loke out a kid got choked out
blows was thrown and a fucking fight broke out

music stops indecipherable sounds of people yelling and arguing 
biggie breaks it up yelling yo chill man chill

cant we just all get along
so i can put hickies on her chest like lil shaun
get her pissy drunk off of don perrignon
and its on and im gone
