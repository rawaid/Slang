verse 1
2205 12 april 2006 pdt~~

nineteen-seventy somethin nigga i dont sweat the date
my moms is late so i had to plan my escape
out the skins in this world of fly girls
tanqueray and hennessy until i cold hurl
ten months in this gut what the fuck
i wish momsd hurry up so i could get buck
wild juvenile rippin mics and shit
new york new york ready for the likes of this uh
then came the worst date may 21st
219 thats when my momma water burst
no spouse in the house so she rolled herself
to the hospital to see if she could get a little help
umbilical cords wrapped around my neck
im seein my death and i aint even took my first step
i made it out im bringin mad joy
the doctor looked and said hes gonna be a bad boy

verse 2
2205 12 april 2006 pdt~~

now im thirteen smokin blunts makin cream
on the drug scene fuck a football team
riskin ruptured spleens by the age of sixteen
hearin the coach scream aint my lifetime dream i mean
i wanna blow up stack my dough up
so school i didnt show up it fucked my flow up
mom said that i should grow up and check myself
before i wreck myself disrespect myself
put the drugs on the shelf  nah couldnt see it
scarface king of new york i wanna be it
rap was secondary money was necessary
until i got incarcerated--kinda scary
c74-mark 8 set me straight
not able to move behind the great steel gate
time to contemplate damn where did i fail
all the money i stacked was all the money for bail

verse 3
2205 12 april 2006 pdt~~

ninety-four now i explore new horizons
mama smile when she see me thats surprisin
honeys is tantalizin they freak all night
peep duckin cops on the creep all night
as i open my eyes and realizin i changed
not the same deranged child stuck up in the game
and to my niggas livin street life
learn to treat life to the best put stress to rest
still tote your vest man niggas be trippin
in the streets without a gat  nah nigga youre slippin
if im pimpin on the f with weed on my breath
original hustler with the muffler on the tec
respect to the macs and the acs
to the freaks in the jeeps lick shots to my peeps
