verse one 

so you wanna be hardcore 
with your hat to the back talkin bout the gats in your raps 
but i cant feel that hardcore appeal 
that youre screamin baby im dreamin 
this aint christopher williams still some
mcs got to feel one caps i got to peel some 
to let niggaz know that if you fuck with big-and-heavy 
i get up in that ass like a wedgie
says who says me the lyrical 
niggaz sayin biggie off the street its a miracle 
left the drugs alone took the thugs along with me 
just for niggaz actin shifty 
sticks and stones break bones but the gatll kill you quicker 
especially when im drunk off the liquor 
smokin funk by the boxes packin glocks is 
natural to eat you niggaz like chocolates 
the funk baby 

chorus repeats 8x

i live for the funk ill die for the funk lotug chief rocka 

verse two 

all i want is bitches big booty bitches 
used to sell crack so i could stack my riches 
now i pack gats to stop all the snitches 
from stayin in my business what is this  relentless 
approach to know if im broke or not 
just cause i joke and smoke a lot 
dont mean i dont tote the glock 
sixteen shots for my niggaz in the pen 
until we motherfuckin meet again 
huh im doin rhymes now fuck the crimes now 
come on the ave im real hard to find now 
cause im knee deep in the beats 
in the land cruiser jeep with the mac-10 by the seats 
for the jackers the jealous ass crackers in the car sirens 
ill make you prove that its bulletproof 
hold ya head cause when you hit the bricks 
i got gin mad blunts and bitches suckin dick 
the funk baby 

repeat chorus

verse three 

so i guess you know the story the rap-side crack-side 
how i smoked funk smacked bitches on the backside 
bed-stuy the place where my head rests 
fifty shot clip if a nigga wan test 
the rocket launcher biggie stomped ya 
high as a motherfuckin helicopter 
thats why i pack a nina fuck a misdeameanor 
beatin motherfuckers like ike beat tina 
whats love got to do 
when im rippin all through your whole crew 
strapped like bamboo but i dont sling guns 
i got bags of funk and its sellin by the tons 
niggaz wanna know how i live the mack life 
making money smoking mics like crack pipes
its type simple and plain to maintain 
i add a little funk to the brain 
machine gun funk baby

repeat chorus
