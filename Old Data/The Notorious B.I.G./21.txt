i been in this game for years it made me a animal
its rules to this shit i wrote me a manual
a step by step booklet for you to get
your game on track not your wig pushed back
rule nombre uno never let no one know
how much dough you hold cause you know
the cheddar breed jealousy specially
if that man fucked up get your ass stuck up
number two never let em know your next move
dont you know bad boys move in silence or violence
take it from your highness uh-huh
i done squeezed mad clips at these cats for they bricks and chips
number three never trust no-bo-dy
your momsll set that ass up properly gassed up
hoodie to mask up shit for that fast buck
she be layin in the bushes to light that ass up
number four know you heard this before
never get high on your own supply
number five never sell no crack where you rest at
i dont care if they want a ounce tell em bounce
number six that god damn credit dead it
you think a crackhead payin you back shit forget it
seven this rule is so underrated
keep your family and business completely seperated
money and blood dont mix like two dicks and no bitch
find yourself in serious shit
number eight never keep no weight on you
them cats that squeeze your guns can hold jobs too
number nine shoulda been number one to me
if you aint gettin bags stay the fuck from police uh-huh
if niggaz think you snitchin aint tryin listen
they be sittin in your kitchen waitin to start hittin
number ten a strong word called consignment
strictly for live men not for freshmen
if you aint got the clientele say hell no
cause they gon want they money rain sleet hail snow
follow these rules youll have mad bread to break up
if not twenty-four years on the wake up
slug hit your temple watch your frame shake up
caretaker did your makeup when you pass
your girl fucked my man jake up heard in three weeks
she sniffed a whole half of cake up
heard she suck a good dick and can hook a steak up
gotta go gotta go more pies to bake up word up uhh

crack king frank whizzahwhite
