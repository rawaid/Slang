buckshots out the sunroof of lexus coupes leave no witnesses 
what you think this is 
aint no amateurs here i damage and tear 
mcs fear me they too near not to hear me clearly 
im the triple beam dream 
1000 grams of uncut to the gut 
it seems fucked up the way i touched up the grill 
try to play guerilla when you aint no killa 
the gats by your liver your upper lip quiver 
youre ready to die tell god i said hi 
and throw down some ice for the nicest mc 
niggas know the stee-lo unbelievable
