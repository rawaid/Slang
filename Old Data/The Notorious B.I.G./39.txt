verse one notorious big

i remember sellin three bricks of straight flour
got my man a beat down to the third power
he didnt care spent the money in a half hour
got some fishscale aint no competition that could sour
got the coke cooked up a crackhead heaven
in eighty-eight when kane ruled with half steppin
a thirty-eight a lot of mouth was our only weapon
we was king till the gs crept in
and now im missin em

chorus

ooh im missin you
tell me why the road turns why it turns
ooh im missin you
nah nah nah nah nah oh tell me why why why why

verse two notorious big

we work all week we dancin play the movies
we rock flatops our girls rocked doobies
made a killin even though the ds knew me
eventually you know they try to do me
fuck it
fed up my nigga want to take it down south
sick of cops comin sick of throwin jacks in his mouth
gave him half my paper told em go that route
few months he got his brain blown out
now im stressed
his babys mother she trippin blamin me
and his older brothers understand the game it be
kinda topsy turvy
you win some you lose some
damn they lost a brother
they mother lost a son
fuck why my nigga couldnt stay in ny
im a thug but i swear for three days i cried
i look in the sky and ask god why
cant look his baby girls in the eye
d*mn i miss you

chorus

verse three notorious big

there was this girl around the way that make cats drool
her names drew played fools out they money in pool
people swore we was f*ckin but we was just cool
she used to hang while i slang my drugs after school
shed watch my bomb help my moms with the groceries
my little sister the girl was kinda close to me
a little closer than the average girls supposed to be
far from a lover my girl was jealous of her
then she started messin with some major players
handled keys niggas called them the bricklayers
a dread kid had a baby fore that bitch taya
found out her babys father cheatin now drew she gotta slay her
one night across from the corner store
taya ran around the block with a chrome four-four
squeezed all six shots in the passenger door
the dude lived what my baby had to die for
we missin her

chorus
