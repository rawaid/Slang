verse one notorious meth

i used to get feels on a bitch
now i throw shields on the dick
to stop me from that hiv shit
and niggaz know they soft like a twinkie filling
playin the villian

biggie smalls is the illest
your style is played out like arnold wondered
what you talkin bout willis
the thrill is gone the black frank white
is here to excite and
throw dick to dykes
bitches i like em brainless
guns i like em stainless steel
i want the fuckin fortune like the wheel
i squeeze gats till my clips is empty
dont tempt me t-h-o-d
man you dont want to fuck with biggie

here i am ill be damned if this aint some shit
come to spread the butter lyrics over hominy grit
its the low killer death trap yes im a jet black ninja

step inside the ring youse the number one contender
lookin cold booty like your pussy in december
nigga stop bitchin button up ya lip and
from method all you gettin is a can of ass-whippin
hey ill be kickin you son you doin all the yappin

yo im from shaolin island and aint afraid to bust somethin

its real ninety-four rugged raw
kickin down your god damn door and it goes a lil somethin like this

chorus

and everything you get ya gotta work hard for it

and niggaz pack the clips keep on

verse two meth notorious

verse two comin with that olde e brew

and niggaz love it not in the physical form but in the mental

im not a gentle man im a method man
baby accept it utmost respect it
assume the position stop look and listen
i spit on your grave then i grab my charles dickens

welcome to my center
honies feel it deep in they placenta
cold as the pole in the winter
far from the inventor but i got this rap shit sewed
and when my mac unloads
im guaranteed another video
ready to die why i act that way
pop duke left mom duke
the faggot took the back way
so instead of makin hoes suck my dick up
i used to do stick-up
cause hoes is irritatin like the hic-cups
excuse me flows just grow through me
like trees to branches
cliffs to avalanches
its the praying mantis
deep like the mind of farrakhan
a motherfuckin rap phenomenon plus

i got more glocks and techs than you
i make it hot niggas wont even stand next to you
nigga touch me you better bust me
tree times in the head
or motherfuckers dead ya thought so

chorus repeat 2x
