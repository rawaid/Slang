okay i remember the days
high rights low lefts even stevens and fades
troops lotto and bks those was the days
high tech boots spray painted witcha name
t-shirts airbrushed that read the same
thick herring bones chain
one gold wit your initial
harris photos group shots can you remember
barry him told his bitch go to the prom and die
didnt lie shot his-self in the head with the 4-5
when she disobeyed had north clayton craze
just to reiterate dog those was the days
fore da invasions of hatas man crews from all around
use to get down at true flavas bumpin kilo
walkin damage cross colored and paco
while playboy step through talent shows
prom nights tux and kangol was so cool
fuck them new model cars we ridin old school old school

[chorus - keon bryce]
we were tryin so hard
hard to survive
cause even though we were young
we had to stay strong
no matter what we went through
it was me and my crew
and thats how it went
when we were kids

[fate wilson]
in 3 months we stayed in jamestown
hamwood and diplomats
played with transformers gi joes and thundercats
we was lovin that
before they started jackin jacks
fore notes from red oaks had folks scared to come through
college park after dark
crown victorias police unmarked cars
be awarewayne williams was out there
but we aint care kids was gettin stabbed and ditched out there
to busy playin
double dare
you touch shorty on the ass thats a bet
want ya kool-aid and sugar smack ya hands and say sweat
its mine now place it in my louis vitton pouch
thump a nigga on his knuckles make him say ouch
slouch socks box chevy caprice
hot knees cut da holes disturbing tha peace
wit no conscience broke niggas call em nonsense
no comments this lil fate payin homage to college park

[chorus - keon bryce]
we were tryin so hard
hard to survive
cause even though we were young
we had to stay strong
no matter what we went through
it was me and my crew
and thats how it went
when we were kids

[ludacris]
i had a long john but no silver
no gold or plat
i was simply red from the years i been holdin back
with 2 sides to a book i lick stamps and light matches
and set fires in garbage pails and cabbage patches
a child of the corn been wild since i was born
climbin over barb wire clothes got torn
shoes got muddy and my click turned cruddy
wherever i go they went they my buddys
i brush teef brush naps and cold streets
dreamin of cadillacs wood wheels and plush seats
cats with gold teeth and raps with such beats
macks with no grief and some sacks of green leaf
when i loaded my cap gun i was ready for action
starin at beer cans and the moment to crack one
wanna hang with the big boys and play with the big toys
and be with all the people makin all that goddamn noise

[chorus - keon bryce x2]
we were tryin so hard
hard to survive
cause even though we were young
we had to stay strong
no matter what we went through
it was me and my crew
and thats how we win
when we were kids
