ludacris born in illinious raise in atlanta

only stand 5 8 but still a big shot
plus i got a big 
clean every day stay fresher then whats in a zip-lock
tell your man to kick rocks when i make my pit stops
im in then its hard to get me out like im a slipnot
wanna be a leader and not no not a follower
only hang with chicks that got more twist then oliver
not much of a hollara but i like to borrow her lips
bringin out the best in me specially if shes a swollowa
freaky deaky yellow man and im sayin hello man
to all the lovely ladies that like to jiggle like jello man
biger booty small waist put em in a small place
and if aint no ass where im at then im in the wrong place
bail like a bondsman but keep em dancin
got pop potential stay black like bob johnson
who the hell is that in that fancy car
tell your momma im a ghetto superstar

chorus x 2

jump down turn around pick a pail of cotton
jump down turn around pick a pail of hay
ohh lordy pick a pail of cotton
ohh lordy pick a pail of hay
 x 2 

still workin like a slave learnin tricks of the trade
in a ghetto state of mind say im rich and im paid
pickin records like cotton in the thick of the day
till im spoiled and im rotten in a sinister way
life no different then those all minimum wage
more money but still locked in a similar cage
either losers of tomorrow or we winners today
now just that and theres really nothin missin to say but

chorus x 2
little buddy what you want
sum violent shit
two steppin layd back still wild n shit
what up hey baby i got the potion
take a sip of this and put your back in motion
