or we can do it on stage of the ludacris concert
cause you know it got sold out
or red carpet dick could just roll out

runnin the train when its hot or when its cold out
how bout in the library on top of books
but you cant be too loud

we can do it in the white house
try to make them turn the lights out
champaign with my campaign let me do the damn thing

on hay in the middle of the barn woo
rose pedals on the silk sheets uh
eating fresh fruits sweep yo woman right off her feet

chorus

ludacris
i wanna get you in the back seat windows up
thats the way you like to fuck
clogged up fog alert
rip the pants and rip the shirt
ruff sex  make it hurt
in the gardenall in the dirt
roll around georgia brown thats the way i like it twerk
legs jerk over worked under-paid but dont be afraid
in the sun or up in the shade
on the top of my escalade
maybe your girl and my friend can trade
tag team off the rope on the ocean or in the boat
factories or on hundred spokes
what bout up in the candy sto that chocolate chocolate make it melt
whips and chains handcuffs smack a little bootie up with my belt
scream help play my game
dracula man ill get my fangs horse back and ill get my reins
school teacher let me get my brains
chorus repeat 4x
