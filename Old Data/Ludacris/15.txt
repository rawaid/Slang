verse 1

talkin about gats traps cops and robbers
its 911 please call the doctor
evacuate the building and trick the pigs
since everybody wanna piece of me we gon split ya wigs
see some fools slipped up and over-stepped their boundaries
you about to catch a cold stay the fuck around from me

im super-charged with the hide-away licence plate
it seems they wanna finger print me and gimmie some years
theyll only get 1 finger while im shifting gears
i got sued on my roof wood grain on the dash
sheep skin on the rug golde grain on the stash
hydraulics all around so i shake the ride

chorus

some punk just tripped up and made you spill your drink
tell me what you gonna do act a fool
now your car just stopped on a empty tank
boy whatcha gonna do act a fool
if you got late bills and you lost your job
tell me what you gonna do act a fool
if you about to get drunk and you ready to mob
boy whatcha gonna do act a fool

verse 2

lets take it to the street cause im ready to cruise
just bought me and my cars all some brand new shoes
and the people just stare so i love to park it
and i just put a computer in the glove compartment
with the pedal to the floor radar in the grill
tv in the middle of my steering wheel
its my cars birthday so we blowin them candles
more speakers in my trunk than my ride can handle
got my name in the headrest read it and weep
nos tank in the back camel hair on the seat
and when i roll up to da club i get all the affection
cause the women love the paintin they can see their reflection
im about to take off f what you heard
because my side mirrors flap like a fuckin bird
and the fools we gon clock one and well pop one
cause my folk ridin shotgun with a shotgun

chorus

you just got hustled for a wad of cash
man whatcha gonna do act a fool
now your friends just smoked up your brand new stash
say whatcha gonna do act a fool
now them girls up the block still running their mouth
boy whatcha gonna do act a fool
if anyone talk bad about the dirty south
tell me whatcha gonna do act a fool

verse 3

i got my eyes wide shut and my trunk wide open
did donuts last week and the street still smokin
see im off that anti-freeze and my car is tipsy
off the off ramp doin about 150
rollin through east pernium on way to ben hill
slide a 5 to the junkie to clean my windshield
got the whole crew ridin and we startin some shit
i even got a trailer hitched with the barbeque pit
now all you wanna do is get drunk and pout
plus your new name is fire cause we stomped you out
and yeah we blow trees and bees thats fantastic
so girls hold ya weaves while im weaving through traffic
i kicked to fifth gear and teared the road apart
youll be like lil john q and get a change of heart
its 1 mission 2 clips and some triple beams
im about to blow this whole shit up to smithereens

chorus

the pot holes in the street just bentcha rims
tell me whatcha gonna do act a fool
man that aint sticky thats just sticks and steams
boy whatcha gonna do act a fool
catch a man with another bitch up in ya bed

if the bottles all gone and your eyes are red
boy whatcha gonna do act a fool
