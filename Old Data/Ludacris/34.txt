yeah i used to care so much what people thought about me
now i really could give a fuck
not when i own over $15 million in real estate
and bought all the fast &amp; furious trucks haha
see everyday i put in work and my salary grows
so excuse me im not caught up on reality shows
see the bridges family values on the southside
i live in atlanta but do not have an atlanta house why
im not married ive never been engaged
but yo dumb-ass believes whatevers on the front page
see some of these bloggers dont even believe their own lies
turn the computer screen into a mirror look atcha own lives
cause technology exceeds all humanity
but theres a thin line between genius and insanity
now private pics on my private no longer private mane
hope i can gets some privacy up on my private plane

ohh-whoa livin in the spotlight
oh if its too hot too hot tonight i think im gonna take flight
but ima be alright alright ima be alright ima be alright
let me live til i die - ohh i

im doin interviews gettin asked the same questions from 10 years ago
wonderin to myself what the fuck im there for
now that my daughters a ceo at the age of 10
and i got restaurants inside atlantas airport
that repetition will drive any human being nutty
id rather be in my own crib on my own couch
thinkin i got that do what the fuck i wanna do money
yeah and then i went to quincy jones house
realize i didnt have shit got some work to do
soon as you get some money its gon be someone with more than you
sci-fi movies the fans said this albums overdue
and if you dont put some music out these niggas gon be over you
talkin bout where that old luda for the rappers sake
but ursher told me if i dont evolve ill evaporate

if youre smart and went to college better use your intuition

ohh-whoa livin in the spotlight
oh if its too hot too hot tonight i think im gonna take flight
but ima be alright alright ima be alright ima be alright
let me live til i die - ohh i

yeah my own expectations i exceeded them
and when people say ludas underrated id agree with em
they said im so visual they overlook the lyrics
but every verse you get a sample if your mind can clear it
then steer it in the direction of your memory
and ill be satisfied when im celebrated for centuries
wrote a song for my girl she couldnt stand straight
my man said dont release it youll ruin your female fan base
i said man my female fan base gon be here for forever
cause even though im with one to them were still together
and who am i to tell em different if my voice can freak em
long as i can continue coming through all of that speakers
im a man of choice words but i speak the truth
and i aint scared of shit except god in a life jail suit
especially when all of my bills are paid for
and god answered everything that i prayed for

ohh-whoa livin in the spotlight
oh if its too hot too hot tonight i think im gonna take flight
but ima be alright alright ima be alright ima be alright
let me live til i die - ohh i

ohh-whoa livin in the spotlight
oh if its too hot too hot tonight i think im gonna take flight
but ima be alright alright ima be alright ima be alright
