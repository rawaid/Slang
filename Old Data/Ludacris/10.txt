[usher]
if you live for something you’re not alone my friend
so fill up your cup and lift your lighter and toast to life

luda

they say what don’t kill me can make me stronger
so two drinks a night should help me live longer
i blow some smoke just to give my lungs a test
cause why tip-toe through life to arrive safely at death
i’m on a journey yeah; i’m on a roll
sometimes gotta close my eyes just to open my soul
and tonight is the night i gotta feeling that i’m about act a fool
so if you go fix some drinks me and usher are about to break some rules

[usher]
that’s somewhere to go but the world is moving slow
i was born for the fast life
i go for broke a lesson i cant afford
but for what its worth i’m ready to pay for the rest of my life
for the rest of my life

[beat break]

[ludacris]
if i got one life to live i’mma party til i’m dead
what the hell is a life worth living if it’s not on the edge
tryna keep my balance; i’m twisted so just in case i fall
written on my tombstone it should say women weed and alcohol

[usher]
that’s somewhere to go but the world is moving slow
i was born for the fast life
i go for broke a lesson i cant afford
but the what its worth i’m ready to pay for the rest of my life
for the rest of my life

[beat break]

[usher]
if you live for something you’re not alone my friend
so fill up your cup and lift your lighters and toast to life yeah

[ludacris]
i’m stuck in this moment freeze the hands of my time
cause i feel inner peace when i’m outta my mind
and you can call me crazy but i like to roll the dice
so i’m willing to bet that i’mma be crazy 

[ludacris &amp; usher]
for the rest of my life
for the rest of my life
for the rest of my life
