damn nigga damn took a chance on ya double and dipped again
go
you could do your dance
take a chance with your lover like this began
sing

i want somebody who can take it apart
stitch me back together make me into who i wanna be
but all you ever do is sit in the dark
dealing with the devil you ain’t never ever gonna be mine

cause i’m born to dance in the moonlight
i feel like spending my nights alone
i try to give you a little more space to grow
white lies i don’t wanna be around anymore
i’m through giving i’ve got to go

am i chasing time
cause i wasted all mine on you you
am i chasing time time
cause i wasted all mine on you you

check my watch i had the future in my pocket
but i lost it when i gave it to you you
if tomorrow drops i had my time right in my locket
but i lost it when i gave it to you you

damn nigga damn
took a chance on you double and dipped again
and scram nigga scram
hit your mans up and tell ‘em to get the van
and reminiscing cant
bring it back to the cabin in michigan
but man this the plan
say goodbye to your lover cause this the end

cause i’m born to dance in the moonlight
i feel like spending my nights alone
i try to give you a little more space to grow
white lies i don’t wanna be around anymore
i’m through giving i’ve got to go

am i chasing time
cause i wasted all mine on you you
am i chasing time time
cause i wasted all mine on you you

check my watch i had the future in my pocket
but i lost it when i gave it to you you
if tomorrow drops i had my time right in my locket
but i lost it when i gave it to you you

yo get lost hit the highway freeway
weve been off-course like the wrong-way relay
need me a boss you’re a constant delay
these the kinda thoughts ive been having for three days
feel like you’re more of a homie
please you don’t even know me
you think i’m starting new relations
i’m just departing and need my space and
time to myself ventilation
no time for you i lack the patience
and you’re like “girl how you do that
my attitude is bitchy but you already knew that
and since we can’t get along
i think we should both move on
go

cause i’m born to dance in the moonlight
i feel like spending my nights alone
i try to give you a little more space to grow
white lies i don’t wanna be around anymore
i’m through giving i’ve got to go

am i chasing time
cause i wasted all mine on you you
am i chasing time time
cause i wasted all mine on you you

check my watch i had the future in my pocket
but i lost it when i gave it to you you
if tomorrow drops i had my time right in my locket
but i lost it when i gave it to you you
