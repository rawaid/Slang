hi hi alright hey alright

all out and wipe for its just island

but i was in new york new york new york

but you just ride away in desire
tryina say hello some of you mean hello

[verse]
you know i spit slick game slick game to the brothers
when i hip hop slang bang bang for the summer
im the sweet sweet thing they say you the summer
so they nick nick name named me the mother
of hip hop pray pray for your butter
you in tip top shake shake nigga running
to the escape straight straight to the cover
little wish pop jupiter queen
your bitch make hits never do it for free
i cant take that risk never 2 out of 3
and took the blue out the scene
the blue in the wave
and hit the bam bams niggas then it blue in the raise
word to you and the man get the blow in the cheese
if you a big shot nigga i am see you believe
and spit the shit on the labour
hit yourself with the name
you little witch pop nigga nigga who could it be
