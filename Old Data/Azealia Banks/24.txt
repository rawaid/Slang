bambi belle of the ball 
banji better than them all 
never been a flaw
pretty kitty manicure the claws silly 
never been a draw 
when i purr bet he wanna paw 
cause a stur when she on the floor 
given it her all
champagne always on the pour
some happy others can applaud 
bum bitches aggy but of course 
mermaid coming on the shore 
take the prince crown and the coin 
shut it down then a bitch is gone 
nother round of dom p√©rignon
downtown vampin to the song
tiara on my head when its worn
style get the critics in amor
physically shawty is the bomb
whether blue weave or the blonde
harlem or milan
banks break the bank and the bonds

i used to think i was fierce 
cause i was in all the houses 
i won trophies 
i used to munch trade for dollars too
but see im fiercer now 
cause i got a job i got an education 
and i got somebody waiting at home for me god damn it
now one queen ask me the other day was it
she told me miss thing you think youre fierce
i said of course
she said all queens think their fierce 
i said miss thing all queens and me

bon appetit im a feast for the eyes 
the reason why im in luxury design 
so chic so ahead the time
kunt queen princess of the prize 
witness the baddest bitch alive 
im reporting from the belly of the night 
gorgeous plus the world is mine
a girl with a twirl and a rhyme
welcome to her house in the sky 

the house the house work me the house 

you pay ten dollar get to the ball you -
work me the house work me the house work me the house
cause you pay ten dollars to get to the ball you -
work me the house work me the house work me the house
cause you pay ten dollar get to the ball you -
work me the house work me the house work me the house
cause you pay ten dollars to get to the ball you -
work me the house work me the house work me the house
cause you pay ten dollars to get in the ball you mock
the house the house the house the house
work me god damn it

back at it gain
my only bad habits my addiction to win
she only mad at it did it better than her friends
you only have cheddar to attend
wang gown with leather on the trim
get together with the slim
mermaid who came on the swim
wave to the gents
do my dips and the spin
turn tricks for the fucking ends
you turned dick for the fucking gem
you a bum bitch to the end
come again come again
you running to the wrong sip rum to the gin
bambi work it out like felons in a gym
hey fella f-fella im better than a ten
eleven in the denim
about twelve in her skin
young mademoiselle the devil wears prada
im giving them hell you bitches gettin nada
