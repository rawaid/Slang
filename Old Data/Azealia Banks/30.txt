see these niggas gased up like texaco
watch your bitch pulling pepsi co

young fool young killa with the finer flow
young rapping doe never will never half a ho
give me celebrate and have a toast

[verse 2]
fast forward live half your life

have a bitch bling twice like a hazard light
more than weekly pass the fights
non believers on astronome
burning people like fahrenheit
run the world like satellite
baby girl got baby girl got options
right dj to the beat h pass the light
far from the passive type
i excite your life and ass it
better than your average
that is captain of the ship baby just imagine
everything you want you can have it
trip trip trip you on a magic
do you really really want the ask us
growing with the phoenix from the ashes
corn with the cash n
no quarter no ration
numbers on the masses runners of the nashin
anything you want is established
anything you want you can have it

[chorus]

[music interlude]

[spoken section]
life is a series of choices
what you eat how you look
whether you do drugs or not
see only you can decide because the only person responsible is you
and if you make the right choice theres nothing you cant accomplish
if you make the wrong choice all your decisions will be made for you

[bridge x2]
