[verse 1]
i take your brain to another dimension
i take your brain in a parallel universe trip
im the only no paralel bitch
things running and shit maneuvered in deep
then i murder you and you spit
get your little outdated frozen a hip
on the word click click
how much is for this clip
blast it off last er you might be stuck on this dick
look at this bitch tick tick
what you do wanna get hit hit
four fifth move quick four fifths in the whip
what dimension is this

im gonna send him to outer space to find another race
im gonna send him to outer space to find another race
im gonna send him to outer space to find another race
im gonna send him to outer space to find another race
pay close attention
i take your brain to another dimension
i take your brain in a parallel universe trip
im the only no paralel bitch
things running and shit maneuvered in deep
then i murder you and you spit
get your little outdated frozen a hip
on the word click click

[verse 2]

yo whats up neutron
giving you money what planet you flew from
ive been pressing the hard rock

cosmos kitchens known as the new york
out of world witch breakers and new borns
space ships push the roof on
platform boots hanging out the coop door
out of the world bitch chicks a new born
every little pun errupt a new song
im ahead of your shaky shoe show
et phone room full of photon
ever since no need for the blues off
keep on the feening the feen off
the fews go finally speed off
here to take you higher than leeloo
bounce off casanova libra
