first lady on the floor move sexy in dior
as we go on and on and on from the dusk til the dawn
fully vampin on the song it’s a ball not a prom
have a pour at the bar at the promenade- yo shorty lookin gorge
the allure of a star
they applaud and in awe
the chips in her palm what’s a pigeon to a swan
a queen to a pawn
luxury is on looking to explore the bambi on the lawn
red carpet to the car in a garment from the gods
i drips and bogart - youre a target from the start
assassinate the look - murdering the gown
fashion-killa the body dipped in brown
get the picture nobody fit the crown
she’s the winner in the lobby with a smile
jet black weave bout the length of a mile
jet black feet while i clever craft styles
miss i’ll flip this and dip-dip twaow
miss i been this you must’ve missed out
dope when dressed up ya boy strung out
his girl is pressed now behave calm down
sip on old grapes and be laid lounge
baby you look late come peep my now
giving them good taste the great’s don’t have
mommy keep blaze better get that cake
shimmy it on stage i’m giving them good face
somebody on her page somebody is amazed
it’s just another day for the dame just another day for the dame

i am miss icon and i swore i saw
a shade of green on ya and i took i took
time to teach ya taught an allure allure
a la-dy you wasnt before
finer free high-modern and more and more
you favor me now how i adore ya
do you dine or tea italian for two
a day to be around here with you with you

hey
grand champ it’s the bougie - the handsome
romance in advance hit ya boo on her samsung
beach bunnies from aruba to cancun
ya bitch save money just to move with the anthem
so prepare my niggas gourmet grape taste we rare my niggas
he where he wear flair beware my niggas
you scared you see-through you clear my nigga
you boys scooby and doo i’m really groovy and frost
you niggas cooped in a hoop i’m cooley high in the porsche
i put these niggas on mute to whom it may not concern
i got the bitch with the juice you got the bitch with the germ
2pac in the coup westside with the herb
i got a flock of the hoots a-list of the birds
white model the muse arizona the first
i took a trip from the moon to jfk for that work
