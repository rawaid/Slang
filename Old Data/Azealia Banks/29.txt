yo you rocking with with the man crook
you can get your man took quicker than your hand shook
no frontin its about his paper
he a giver im a taker and a fibber and a faker
you gotta spend a lot for this behavior
if it aint about a dollar im a holler at you later

yeah you already know
i get the dough and its never slow and its never slow
never know and if you dont its whatever yo
pay pay pay
gotta get it gotta get i gotta get it
you gotta spend a lot for this behavior
if it aint about a dollar im a holler at you later

light skin world light skin girls
switching his vanilla cause he likes that swirl yeah
he like black girls and he love a musician
and fucking with this older nigga he a fucking magician son
he tricking off cause my verse perverse
and jerking off when a bitch rehearse him
when i lift the skirt your nigga never gotta be coerced
just squirt and he eats the dessert and thats some real shit
i mean real tits nice ass tight twat
dome fucking up a nigga home call a bitch swat
i get it tighter than a gridlock
open your face and let a bitch squat
i tell him you should let his bitch watch
cause she wanna piss nah
i tell her she could lick this box
cause i aint really with that dick-swap
even if you switch socks
bitch is fishier than chip shop
and he was praying that her shit pop
every time i say deeper i get it warmer than a space heater
no ordinary taste either this that candy
he was tryin lick it off to see through my panties
i was tryin kick it but he was like can he-
eat a little dinner want to sit with my family
nah theres probably not a lot in this container
if it aint about a dollar im a holler at you later ha
