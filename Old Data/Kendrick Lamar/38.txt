if pirus and crips all got along
theyd probably gun me down by the end of this song
seem like the whole city go against me
every time im in the street i hear

yawk yawk yawk yawk

man down
where you from nigga
fuck who you know where you from my nigga
where your grandma stay huh my nigga
this maad city i run my nigga

brace yourself ill take you on a trip down memory lane
this is not a rap on how im slingin crack or move cocaine
this is cul-de-sac and plenty cognac and major pain
not the drill sergeant but the stress that weighing on your brain
it was me l boogs and yan yan yg lucky ride down rosecrans
it got ugly waving your hand out the window check yo self
uh warriors and conans
hope euphoria can slow dance with society
the driver seat the first one to get killed
seen a light-skinned nigga with his brains blown out
at the same burger stand where hang out
now this is not a tape recorder saying that he did it
but ever since that day i was lookin at him different
that was back when i was nine
joey packed a nine
pakistan on every porch is fine
we adapt to crime pack a van with four guns at a time
with the sliding door fuck is up
fuck you shootin for if you aint walkin up
you fuckin punk pickin up the fuckin pump
pickin off you suckers suck a dick or die or sucker punch
or warn the bullets comin from
aks ars aye yall duck
thats what momma said when we was eatin the free lunch
aw man god damn all hell broke loose
you killed my cousin back in 94 fuck yo truce
now crawl yo head in that noose
you wind up dead on the news
aint no peace treaty just pieces
bgs up to pre-approve bodies on top of bodies
ivs on top of ivs
obviously the coroner between the sheets like the isleys
when you hop on that trolley
make sure your colors correct
make sure youre cornbread or theyll be calling your mother collect
they say the governor collect all of our taxes except
when we in traffic and tragic happens that shit aint no threat
you movin backwards if you suggest that you sleep wit a tec
go buy a chopper and have a doctor on speed dial i guess
maad city

man down
where you from nigga
fuck who you know where you from my nigga
where your grandma stay huh my nigga
this maad city like run my nigga

if pirus and crips all got along
theyd probably gun me down by the end of this song
seem like the whole city go against me
every time im in the street i hear

yawk yawk yawk

wake yo punk ass up
it aint nothin but a compton thang
chyea
real simple and plain
imma teach you some lessons about the street
it aint nothin but a compton thang
chyea
how we do

fresh outta school cause i was a high school grad
sleeping in the living room in my mommas pad
reality struck i seen the white car crash
hit the light pole two niggas hopped out on foot and dashed
my pops said i needed a job i thought i believed him
security guard for a month and ended up leaving
in fact i got fired because i was inspired by all of my friends
to stage a robbery the third saturday i clocked in
projects tore up gang signs get thrown up
cocaine laced in marijuana
and they wonder why i rarely smoke now
imagine if your first blunt had you foaming at the mouth
i was straight tweaking the next weekend we broke even
i made a legion then made a promise to see you bleeding
you know the reasons but still wont ever know my life
kendrick aka comptons human sacrifice

cocaine weed
niggas been mixing shit since the 80s loc
shine sticks buck nakeds
make a nigga flip
cluck heads all up and down the block and shit
one times crooked and shit
block a nigga in
alondra rosecrans bullis
im still in the hood
loc yeah thats cool
the hood took me under so i follow the rules
but yeah thats like me i grew up in the hood where they bang
and niggas that rep colors is doing the same thing
pass it to the left so i can smoke on me
a couple drive-bys in the hood lately
couple of ivs with the fucking spraycan
shots in the crowd then everybody ran
crew im finna slay the street life i crave
shots hit the enemy harsh turn brave
mount up regulators in the whip
down the boulevard with the pistol grip
trip we in the hood still
so loc grab a strap cause yeah its so real
deal with the outcome a strap in the hand
and a bird and 10 grands where motherfuckers stand

if i told you i killed a nigga at 16 would you believe me
or see me to be innocent kendrick that you seen in the street
with a basketball and some now &amp; laters to eat
if im mashing all of my skeletons would you jump in the seat
would you say my intelligence now is great relief
and its safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep
with dreams of being a lawyer or doctor
instead of boy with a chopper that hold the cul de sac hostage
kill them all if they gossip the children of the corn
they realizing the option of living a lie drive they body with toxins
constantly drinking and drive hit the powder then watch this flame
that arrive in his eye; this a coward the concept is aim and
they bang it and slide out that bitch with the pies
and the price on his head the tots probably go to the projects
i live inside the belly of the rough
compton usa made me an angel on angel dust what
