mass hallucination baby
ill education baby
want to reconnect with your relations
this is your station baby

look inside these walls and you see them having withdrawals
of a prisoner on his way
trapped inside your desire
to fire bullets that stray
track a tire just tell you im tired and ran away
i should ask a choir what do you require
to sing a song that acquire me to have faith
as the record spin i should pray
for the record i recognize that im easily prey
i got ate alive yesterday
i got animosity building
its probably big as a building
me jumping off of the roof
is just me playing it safe
but what am i supposed to do
when the topic is red or blue
and you understand that i aint
but know im accustomed to
just a couple that look for trouble
and live in the street with rank
no better picture to paint than me walking from bible study
and called his homies because he had said he noticed my face
from a function that tooken place
they was wondering if i bang
step on my neck and get blood on your nike checks
i dont mind because one day you respect
the good kid maad city

all i see is strobe lights
blinding me in my hindsight
finding me by myself
promise me you can help
in all honesty i got time to be copacetic
and finally made decision to hold me against my will
it was like a head on collision that folded me standing still
i can never pick out the difference
 or cop on the bill
every time you clock in the morning
i feel you just want to kill
all my innocence while ignoring my purpose
to persevere as a better person
i know you heard this and probably in fear
but what am i supposed to do
with the blinking of red and blue
flash from the top of your roof
and your dog has to say proof
and you ask lift up your shirt
cause you wonder if a tattoo
of affiliation can make it a pleasure to put me through
gang files but that dont matter because the matter is racial profile
i heard them chatter hes probably young but i know that hes down
step on his neck as hard as your bullet proof vest
he dont mind he know we never respect
the good kid maad city

all i see in this room
20 xanies and these shrooms
grown-up candy for pain
can we live in the same society
its entirely stressful upon my brain
you hired me as a victim
i quietly hope for change
when violence is the rhythm
inspired me to obtain
the silence in this room
with 20 xanies and shrooms
some grown-up candy i lost it
i feel its nothing to lose
the streets sure to release the worst side of my best
dont mind cause now you ever in debt
to good kid maad city
