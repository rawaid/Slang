in time youll learn this is about you x3

babies from 80s dont know no better
dont nothing go better with ignorance
but the belligerent kids that we living with
some of them masculine some of the feminine
member the universe used to be innocent
now they just look at us crazy like immigrants
everyday that i wake up im a sin again
im not a citizen
im just a nigga from section80

show of hands how many been taking notes
good
leave everything on the table now
on the real
this is your generation
show show your pain
