i woke up this morning and figured id call you
in case im not here tomorrow
im hoping that i can borrow a piece of mind
im behind on whats really important
my mind is really distorted
i find nothing but trouble in my life
im fortunate you believe in a dream
this orphanage we call a ghetto is quite a routine
and last night was just another distraction
or a reaction of what we consider madness
i know exactly what happened
you ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help
held him like a newborn baby and made him feel
like everything was alright
and a fight he tried to put up but the type
of bullet that stuck had went against his will
as blood spilled on your hands
my plans rather vindictive
everybodys a victim in my eyes
when i ride its a murderous rhythm
and outside became pitch black
a demon glued to my back whispering get em
i got em and i aint give a fuck
that same mentality i told my brother not to duck
in actuality its a trip how we trip off of colors
i wonder if ill ever discover
a passion like you and recover
the life that i knew as a youngn
in pajamas and dun-ta-duns
when thunder comes it rains cats and dogs
dumb niggas like me never prosper
prognosis of a problem child
im proud and well devoted
this piru shit been in me forever
so forever imma push it wherever whenever
and i love you cause you love my brother like you did
just promise me youll tell this story when you make it big
and if i die before your album drop i hope --

promise that you will sing about me
promise that you will sing about me

you wrote a song about my sister on your tape
and called it section 80 the message resemble brendas got a baby
whats crazy was i was hearin about it
but doubted your ignorance how could you ever
just put her on blast and shit
judging her past and shit
well its completely my future
a nigga behind me right now asking for ass and shit
and imma need that 40 dollars even if i gotta
fuck suck and swallow in the parking lot
gonzales park im followed by a married man a father of three
my titties bounce on the cadence of his tingling keys
matter of fact he my favorite cause he tip me with es
he got a cousin named david and i seen him last week
this is the life of another girl damaged by the system
these foster homes i run away and never do miss em
see my hormones just run away and if i can get em back
to where they used to be then ill probably be in the denim
of a family gene that show women how to be woman or better yet a leader
you need her to learn something then you probably need to beat her
thats how i was taught
three niggas in one room first time i was tossed
and im exhausted
but fuck that sorry for your loss shit
my sister died in vain but what point are you trying to gain
if you cant fit the pumps i walk in
ill wait
your rebuttal a little too late
and if you have a album date just make sure im not in the song
cause i dont need the attention bring enough of that on my own
and matter fact did i mention that i physically feel great
a doctors approval is a waste of time i know im straight
ill probably live longer than you and never fade away
ill never fade away ill never fade away
i know my fate and im on the grind for this cake
imma get or die trying im eyeing every male gender with intentions of buying
you lying to these motherfuckers talking about you can help with my story
you can help me if you sell this pussy for me nigga
dont ignore me nigga where the fuck is u going nigga this bullshit

sometimes i look in a mirror and ask myself
am i really scared of passing away
if its today i hope i hear a
cry out from heaven so loud it can water down a demon
with the holy ghost till it drown in the blood of jesus
i wrote some raps that make sure that my lifeline
rake in the cent of a reaper ensuring that my allegiance
with the other side may come soon
and if im doomed may the wound
help me mother be blessed for many moons
i suffer a lot
and every day the glass mirror get tougher to watch
i tie my stomach in knots
and im sure not why im infatuated with death
my imagination is surely an aggravation of threats
that can come about
cause the tongue is mighty powerful
and i can name a list of your favorites that probably vouch
maybe cause im dreamer and sleep is the cousin of death
really stuck in the scheme of wondering whem imma rest
and youre right your brother was a brother to me
and your sisters situation was the one that put me
in a direction to speak of something thats realer than the tv screen
by any means wasnt trying to offend or come between
her personal life i was like it need to be told
cursing the life of 20 generations after her so
exactly would have happened if i hadnt continued rappin
or steady being distracted by money drugs and four
fives i count lives all on these songs
look at the weak and cry pray one day youll be strong
fighting for your rights even when youre wrong
and hope that at least one of you sing about me when im gone
now am i worth it
did i put enough work in

promise that you will sing about me
promise that you will sing about me

i said when the lights shut off
and its my turn to settle down
my main concern
promise that you will sing about me
promise that you will sing about me

dying of thirst

tired of running
tired of hunting
my own kind
but retiring nothing
tires are steady screeching the driver is rubbing
hands on the wheel who said we wasnt
dying of thirst
dying of thirst
dying of thirst

dope on the corner
look at the coroner
daughter is dead
mother is mourning her
strayed bullets ak bullets
resuscitation was waiting patiently
but they couldnt bring her back
who got the footage channel 9
cameras lookin its hard to channel your energy
when you know youre crooked
banana clip split his banana pudding
im like tre thats cuba gooding
i know im good at
dying of thirst
dying of thirst
dying of thirst

how many sins
im running out
how many sins
i lost count
dreams are ballin like spaulding
but only shotty bounce
the reaper calling
im cottonmouth
money is power yours is ours
lay with a snitch die with a coward
hope we get rich hope we can tower
over the city with vanity with the music louder
the same song
a black flower
ill show you how to
dye your thirst
dye your thirst
dye your thirst

what are we doing
who are we fooling
hell is hot fire is proven
to burn for eternity return of the student
that never learned how to live righteous but how to shoot it
tired of running choirs is humming
tell us to visit we lying about coming
now back to business loading the guns in
back of the buick your hood is feud
and the beef is bubbling
its no discussion hereditary
all of my cousins
dying of thirst
dying of thirst
dying of thirst

too many sins
im running out
somebody sinned
me a well for the drought
see all i know is taking notes
on taking this life for granted
granted if he provoke
my best days i stress days lord forgive me for all my sins for i not know
my best days i stress days
say fuck the world my sex slave
money pussy and greed was my next crave
whatever it is know its next grave
tired of running tired of running
tired of tumbling tired of running
tired of tumbling
back once my momma say
see a pastor give me a promise
what if today was the rapture and you completely tarnished
the truth will set you free so to me be completely honest
you dying of thirst
you dying of thirst
so hop in that water and pray that it works
