i do what i wanna do
i say what i wanna say
when i feel and i
look in the mirror and know im there
with my hands in the air
im proud to say yea
im real im real im really really real 
im real im real im really really real
im real im real im really really real 
im real im real im really really real

i promise that i know you very well
your eyes never lie even if they tell
sweet lullabies that come with a smell
of a dozen roses flippin down the green hill
you living in a world that come with plan b
cause plan a never relay a guarantee
and plan c never could say just what it was
and your plans only can pan around love
you love him you love them you love her
you love so much you love when love hurts
you love red-bottom and gold they say queen
you love hand-bag on the waist of your jean
you love french tip and trip that pay for
you love bank slip that tell you we paid more
you love a good hand whenever the card dealt
but what love got to do with it when you dont love yourself

i do what i wanna do
i say what i wanna say
when i feel and i
look in the mirror and know im there
with my hands in the air
im proud to say yea
im real im real im really really real 
im real im real im really really real
im real im real im really really real 
im real im real im really really real

i promise that i know you very well
your eyes never lie even if they fell
out the sky and your optics turn stale
where they mow thats green
i can see you fit the bill
of living in a world that come with plan b
cause plan a only can make another mistake
and you cant see success coming from plan c
when it all breaks you you still say you love me
and love them and love when you love her
you love so much you love when love hurts
you love fast cars and their present is old
you love fast women
you love keepin control
of everything you love you love beef
you love streets you love runnin duckin police
you love your hood might even love it to death
but what love got to do with it when you dont love yourself

i do what i wanna do
i say what i wanna say
when i feel and i
look in the mirror and know im there
with my hands in the air
im proud to say yea
im real im real im really really real 
im real im real im really really real
im real im real im really really real 
im real im real im really really real

the reason why i know you very well
cause we have the same eyes cant you tell
the days i tried to cover up and conceal
my pride it only made it harder for me to deal
when living in a that come with plan b
a scapegoat cause plan a dont come for free
and plan c just an excuse like because
or the word but but what if i got love
i love them i love when i love her
i love so much i love when love hurts
i love first verse cause youre the girl i attract
i love second verse cause your the homie they packed
burning like a stove top they love cooking from scratch
i love what the both of you have to offer
in fact i love it so much
i dont love anything else
but what love got to do with it when i dont love myself
to the point i should hate everything i do love
should i hate living my life inside the club
should i hate her for watching me for that reason
should i hate him for telling me that im season
should i hate them for telling me ball out
should i hate street credibility im talkin about
hatin all money power respect in my will
im hatin the fact that none of that shit make me real

 i aint trippin off that dominos anymore just calling sorry to hear what happen to your homeboy but dont learn the hard way like i did homie any nigga can kill a man that dont make you a real nigga realness is responsibility realness is taking care of your motherfucking family realness is god nigga

i do what i wanna do
i say what i wanna say
when i feel and i
look in the mirror and know im there
with my hands in the air
im proud to say yea
im real im real im really really real 
im real im real im really really real
im real im real im really really real 
im real im real im really really real
