loving you is complicated

i place blame when you steal
place shame when you steal
feel like you aint shit
feel like you dont feel confidence in yourself
breakin on marble floors
watchin anonymous strangers tellin me that im yours
but you aint shit im convinced your talents nothin special
what can i blame him for
nigga i can name several
situation had stopped with your little sister bakin
a baby inside just a teenager wheres your antennas
whats your intentions where is the influence you speak of
you preached in front of 100000 but never reached her
i fuckin tell you you fuckin failure you aint no leader
i never liked you forever despise you i dont need you
the world dont need you dont let them deceive you
numbers lie too fuck your pride too thats for dedication
thought money would change you made you more complacent
i fuckin hate you i hope you embrace it

loving you is complicated

lovin you lovin you not lovin you one hundred proof
i can feel you vibin recognize that your ashamed of me
yes i hate you too

house keeping

¡abre la puerta ¡abre la puerta tengo que limpiar el cuarto
¡es que no hay mucho tiempo tengo que limpiar el cuarto¡
disculpe

are you the reason why mama and them leavin
no you aint shit you say you love them i know you dont mean it
i know youre irresponsible selfish in denial cant help it
your trials and tribulations a burden everyone felt it
everyone heard it multiple shots corners cryin out
you was deserted where was your antennas again
where was your presence where was your support that you pretend
you ain’t no brother you ain’t no disciple you ain’t no friend
a friend never leave compton for profit or leave his best friend
little brother you promised you’d watch him before they shot him
where was your antennas on the road bottles and bitches
you faced time the one time thats unforgiven
you even faced time instead of a hospital visit
you should thought he would recover well
the surgery couldnt stop the bleeding for real
then he died god himself will say you fuckin failed
you aint try

i know your secrets nigga
mood swings is frequent nigga
i know depression is restin on your heart for two reasons nigga
i know you and a couple block boys aint been speakin nigga
yall damn near beefin i seen it and your the reason nigga
and if this bottle could talk *gulp* i cry myself to sleep
bitch everything is your fault
faults breakin to pieces earthquakes on every weekend
because you shook as soon as you knew confinement was needed
i know your secrets
dont let me tell them to the world about that shit you thinkin
and that time you *gulp* im bout to hurl
im fucked up but im not as fucked up as you
you just cant get right i think your heart made of bullet proof
shoulda killed yo ass a long time ago
you shoulda filled that black revolver blast a long time ago
and if those mirrors could talk it would say you gotta go
and if i told your secrets
the worldll know money cant stop a suicidal weakness
