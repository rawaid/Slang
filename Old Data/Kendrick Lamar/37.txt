every second every minute man i swear that she can get it
say if you a bad bitch put your hands up high hands up high hands up high
tell em dim the lights down right now put me in the mood
im talking bout dark room perfume
go go

i recognize your fragrance hol up
you aint never gotta say shit woo
and i know your taste is
a little bit mmm high maintenance ooh
everybody else basic
you live life on an everyday basis
with poetic justice poetic justice
if i told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room would you trust it
i mean write poems in these songs dedicated to you
and youre in the mood for empathy theres blood in my pen
better yet when your friends and them
i really wanna know you all
i really wanna show you off
fuck that pour up plenty of champagne
cold nights when you curse this name
you called up your girlfriends and
yall curled in that little bitty range i heard that
she wanna go and party she wanna go and party
nigga dont approach her with that atari
nigga that aint good game homie sorry
they say conversation rule a nation i can tell
but i can never right my wrongs
less i write it down for real ps

you can get it you can get it

and i know just know just know just know just know just
what you want poetic justice put it in a song

you can get it you can get it

and i know just know just know just know just know just
what you want poetic justice put it in a song

i really hope you play this
cause ol girl you test my patience
with all these seductive photographs and all these one off vacations
youve been taken
clearly a lot for me to take in
it dont make sense
young east african girl you too busy fucking with your other man
i was trying to put you on game put you on a plane
take you and your mama to the motherland
i could do it maybe one day
when you figure out youre gonna need someone
when you figure out its all right here in the city
and you dont run from where we come from
that sound like poetic justice poetic justice
you were so new to this life but god damn you got adjusted
i mean i write poems in these songs dedicated to the fun sex
your natural hair and your soft skin and your big ass in that sundress ooh
good god what you doing that walk for
when i see that thing move i just wish we would fight less and we would talk more
and they say communication saves relations i can tell
but i can never right my wrongs unless i write them down for real
ps

you can get it you can get it
you can get it you can get it
and i know just know just know just know just know just
what you want poetic justice put it in a song

every time i write these words they become a taboo
making sure my punctuation curve
every letter is true
living my life in the margin and that metaphor was proof
im talking poetic justice poetic justice
if i told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room would you trust it
i mean you need to hear this
love is not just a verb its you looking in the mirror
love is not just a verb its you looking poor maybe
call me crazy we can both be insane
a fatal attraction is common
and what we have common is pain
i mean you need to hear this
love is not just a verb and i can see power steering
sex drive when you swerve i want that interference
its coherent i can hear it mmhmm
thats your heartbeat
it either caught me or it called me mmhmm
breathe slow and youll find gold mines in these lines
sincerely yours truly
and right before you go blind
ps

you can get it you can get it
you can get it you can get it
and i know just know just know just know just know just
what you want poetic justice put it in a song
