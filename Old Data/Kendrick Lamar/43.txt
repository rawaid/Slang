were far from good not good from far
90 miles per hour down compton boulevard
with the top down screaming we dont give a fuck
drink my 40 ounce of freedom while i roll a blunt
cause the kids just aint all right

oh shit nigga something bout to happen nigga this shit
nigga this sound like 30 kis under the compton court building
hope the dogs dont smell it

welcome to vigilante 80s so dont you ask me
im hungry my bodys antsy i rip through your fucking pantry
peeling off like a xanny examine my orchestra
granny said when im old enough ill be sure to be all i can be
you niggas marcus camby washed up
pussy fix your panties im mr marcus you getting fucked uh
you aint heard nothing harder since daddy kane
take it in vain vicodins couldnt ease the pain
lightning bolts hit your body you thought it rained
not a cloud in sight just the shit that i write
strong enough to stand in front of a travelling freight train are you trained
to go against dracula dragging the record industry by my fangs
ak clips money clips and gold chains
you walk around with a p90 like its the 90s
bullet to your temple your homicidell remind me that

compton crip niggas aint nothing to fuck with
bompton pirus aint nothing to fuck with
compton es√©s aint nothing to fuck with

woop de woop woop de woop woop woop de woop
woop de woop woop de woop woop california dungeons

lets hit the county building gotta cash my check
spend it all on a 40-ounce to the neck and
in retrospect i remember december being the hottest
squad cars neighborhood wars and stolen mazdas
i tell you motherfuckers that life is full of hydraulics
up down get a 64 better know how to drive it
im driving on e with no license or registration
heart racing racing past johnny because hes racist
1987 the children of ronald reagan raked the leaves off
your front porch with a machine blowtorch im really out here my nigga
you blowing on stress hoping to ease the stress like really out here
he copping some blow hoping that he can stretch
newborn massacre hopping out the passenger
with calendars cause your dates coming
run him down and then he gun him down im hoping that you fast enough
even the legs of michael johnson dont mean nothing because

cant detour when youre at war with your city why run for it
just ride with me just die with me that gun store
right there when you fight dont fight fair cause youll never win yeah
right i had the yapper and i tore they ass up
we really out here my nigga you niggas dont understand my nigga
im off of pill and remy red my nigga trippin my nigga
