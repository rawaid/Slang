complexion two-step
complexion dont mean a thing its a zulu love
complexion two-step
it all feels the same its a zulu love

dark as the midnight hour or bright as the mornin sun
give a fuck about your complexion i know what the germans done
sneak dissin’
sneak me through the back window i’m a good field nigga
i made a flower for you outta cotton just to chill with you
you know id go the distance you know im ten toes down
even if master listenin cover your ears he bout to mention

complexion two-step
complexion dont mean a thing its a zulu love
complexion two-step
it all feels the same its a zulu love

dark as the midnight hour im bright as the mornin sun
brown skinned but your blue eyes tell me your mama cant run
sneak dissin
sneak me through the back window i’m a good field nigga
i made a flower for you outta cotton just to chill with you
you know id go the distance you know im ten toes down
even if masters listenin i got the worlds attention
so imma say somethin thats vital and critical for survival
of mankind if he lyin color should never rival
beauty is what you make it i used to be so mistaken
by different shades of faces
then wit told me youre womanless woman love the creation
it all came from god then you was my confirmation
i came to where you reside
and looked around to see more sights for sore eyes
let the willie lynch theory reverse a million times with

complexion two-step
complexion dont mean a thing its a zulu love
complexion two-step
it all feels the same its a zulu love

you like it i love it
you like it i love it

let me talk my stu scott ‘scuse me on my 2pac
keep your head up when did you stop love and die
color of your skin color of your eyes
that’s the real blues baby like you met jay’s baby
you blew me away you think more beauty in blue green and grey
all my solomon up north 12 years a slave
12 years of age thinkin’ my shade too dark
i love myself i no longer need cupid
and forcin’ my dark side like a young george lucas
light don’t mean you smart bein’ dark don’t make you stupid
and frame of mind for them bustas ain’t talkin’ “woohah”
need a paradox for the pair of dots they tutored
like two ties l-l you lose two times
if you don’t see you beautiful in your complexion
it ain’t complex to put it in context
find the air beneath the kite that’s the context
yeah baby i’m conscious ain’t no contest
if you like it i love it all your earth tones been blessed
ain’t no stress jigga boos wanna be
i ain’t talkin’ jay i ain’t talkin’ bey
i’m talkin’ days we got school watchin’ movie screens
and spike yourself esteem
the new james bond gon’ be black as me
black as brown hazelnut cinnamon black tea
and it’s all beautiful to me
call your brothers magnificent call all the sisters queens
we all on the same team blues and pirus no colors ain’t a thing

barefoot babies with no cares
teenage gun toters that don’t play fair should i get out the car
i don’t see compton i see something much worse
the land of the landmines the hell that’s on earth
