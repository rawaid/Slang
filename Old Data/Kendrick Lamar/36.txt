now i done grew up
round some people living their life in bottles
granddaddy had the golden flask
back stroke every day in chicago
some people like the way it feels
some people wanna kill their sorrows
some people wanna fit in with the popular
that was my problem
i was in the dark room
loud tunes looking to make a vow soon
that imma get fucked up fillin up my cup
i see the crowd mood
changing by the minute and the record on repeat
took a sip then another sip then somebody said to me

nigga why you babysittin only two or three shots
imma show you how to turn it up a notch
first you get a swimming pool full of liquor then you dive in it
pool full of liquor then you dive in it
i wave a few bottles then i watch em all flock
all the girls wanna play baywatch
i got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
pool full of liquor imma dive in it

aw man what is she taking
where is she taking
all i all i all i all i
all i have in life is my new appetite for failure
and i got hunger pain that grow insane
tell me do that sound familiar
if it do then youre like me
making excuse that your relief
is in the bottom of the bottle
and the greenest indo leaf
as the window open
i release everything that corrode inside of me
i see you joking why you laugh
dont you feel bad
i probably sleep and never ever wake up
never ever wake up never ever wake up
in god i trust
but just when i thought i had enough
