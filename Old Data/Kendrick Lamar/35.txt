hit me
when the four corners of this cocoon collide
you’ll slip through the cracks hoping that you’ll survive
gather your wind take a deep look inside
are you really who they idolize
to pimp a butterfly

at first i did love you
when i just wanna fuck
late night thinkin of you
until i got my nut
tossed and turned lesson learned
you was my first girlfriend
bridges burned all across the board
destroyed but what for

when i get signed homie imma act a fool
hit the dance floor strobe lights in the room
snatch your little secretary bitch for the homies
blue eyed devil with a fat ass monkey
imma buy a brand new cutty on fours
trunk the hood up two times deuce four
platinum on everything platinum on wedding ring
married to the game made a bad bitch yours
when i get signed homie imma buy a strap
straight from the cia set it on my lap
take a few m-16s to the hood
pass em all out on the block whats good
imma put the compton swap meet by the white house
republican run up get socked out
hit the pres with a cuban link on my neck
uneducated but i got a million dollar check like that

yo whats up its dre
remember the first time you came out to the house
you said you wanted a spot like mine
but remember anybody can get it
the hard part is keeping it motherfucker

kendrick lamar
what you want you a house or a car
forty acres and a mule a piano a guitar
anything see my name is uncle sam im your dog
motherfucker you can live at the mall
i know your kind thats why im kind
dont have receipts oh man thats fine
pay me later wear those gators
cliche and say fuck your haters
i can see the borrow in you
i can see the dollar in you
little white lies with a snow white collar in you
but its whatever though because im still followin you
because you make me live forever baby count it all together baby
then hit the register and make me feel better baby
your horoscope is a gemini two sides
so you better cop everything two times
two coupes two chains two c-notes
too much aint enough both we know
christmas tell em whats on your wish list
get it all you deserve it kendrick
and when you hit the white house do you
but remember you aint pass economics in school
and everything you buy taxes will deny
ill wesley snipe your ass before thirty-five

george clinton and kendrick lamar
lookin down is quite a drop its quite a drop drop
lookin good when youre on top when youre on top you got it
a lot of metaphors leavin miracles metaphysically in a state of euphoria
look both ways before you cross my mind

we should never gave we should never gave niggas money
