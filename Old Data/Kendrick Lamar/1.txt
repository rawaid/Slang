we got a young brother that stands for something we got a young brother that believes in the all of us brother kendrick lamar hes not a rapper hes a writer hes an author and if you read between the lines well learn how to love one another but you cant do that—right on—i said you cant do that without loving yourself first 

this is a world premiere
i done been through a whole lot
trial tribulation but i know god
satan wanna put me in a bow tie
praying that the holy water dont go dry get it get it
as i look around me
so many motherfuckers wanna down me
but an enemigo never drown me
in front of a dirty double-mirror they found me

and i love myself
the world is a ghetto with big guns and picket signs
i love myself
but it can do what it want whenever it wants and i don’t mind
i love myself
he said i gotta get up life is more than suicide
i love myself
one day at a time sun gon shine

everybody looking at you crazy crazy
what you gon do what you gon do
lift up your head and keep moving keep moving
or let the paranoia haunt you haunt you
peace to fashion police i wear my heart
on my sleeve let the runway start
you know the miserable do love company
what do you want from me and my scars
everybody lack confident everybody lack confident
how many times our potential was anonymous
how many times the city making me promises
so i promise this

and i love myself
the world is a ghetto with big guns and picket signs
i love myself
but it can do what it want whenever it wants and i don’t mind
i love myself
he said i gotta get up life is more than suicide
i love myself
one day at a time sun gon shine

they wanna say theres a war outside and a bomb in the street
and a gun in the hood and a mob of police
and a rock on the corner and a line full of fiends
and a bottle full of lean and a model on a scheme yup
these days of frustration keep yall on tuck and rotation
i duck these gold faces post up fee-fi-fo-fum basis
dreams of realities peace
blow steam in the face of the beast
the sky can fall down the wind can cry now
the strong in me i still smile

and i love myself
the world is a ghetto with big guns and picket signs
i love myself
but it can do what it want whenever it wants and i don’t mind
i love myself
he said i gotta get up life is more than suicide
i love myself
one day at a time sun gon shine

walk my bare feet walk my bare feet
down down valley deep down down valley deep
i keep my fee-fi-fo-fum fee-fi-fo-fum
i keep my heart undone my heart undone

and i love myself
the world is a ghetto with big guns and picket signs
i love myself
but it can do what it want whenever it wants and i don’t mind
i love myself
he said i gotta get up life is more than suicide
i love myself
one day at a time sun gon shine

i went to war last night
with an automatic weapon dont nobody call a medic
imma do it til i get it right
i went to war last night
ive been dealing with depression ever since an adolescent
duckin every other blessin i can never see the message
i could never take the lead i could never bob and weave
from a negative and letting em annihilate me
and its evident im moving at a meteor speed
finna run into a building lay my body in the street
keep my money in the ceiling let my mama know im free
give my story to the children and the lesson they can read
and the glory to the feeling of the only unseen
seen enough make a motherfucker scream i love myself

i lost my head
i must misread what the good book said
oh woes be me its a jungle inside
give myself again til the well runs dry
