8 doobies to the face

verse 1 kendrick lamar
man i swear
my nigga trippin off that shit again
pick him up then i set him in
cold water then i order someone to bring him vicodin
hope to take the pain away
from the feeling that he feel today
you know when you part of section 80
and you feeling like no one can relate
cause you are you are
a loner loner
marijuana endorphins
make you stronger stronger
im in the house party trippin off
my generation sippin cough syrup like its water
never no pancakes in the kitchen
man no wonder our lives is caught up
in the daily superstition
that the word is bout to end
who gives a fuck we never do listen
unless it comes with an 808
a melody and some hoes
playstation and some drank
technology bumping soul
looking around and all i see
is a big crowd thats product of me
and they probably relatives
relevant for a rebels dream
yep the president is black
she black too
purple label on her back
but that dap
is like when she take it straight to the head
then she look at me
she got adhd

verse 2 kendrick lamar
and then she started
and then she started
feeling herself like no on else in this apartment
beg you pardon
oh i rap baby how old are you
she say 22 i say 23
ok then we all crack babies
damn why you say that
she said where my drink at
im a tell you later just tell your neighbors
have the police relax
i stood up shut the blinds
closed the screen jumbotron
made it to the back where she reside
then she said read between the lines
yep hope that i get close enough
when the lights turn down
and the fact that she just might open up
when the new flow start to drown
her body and i know the both of us really deep in the move now
its nothing we can do now
somebody walked in with a pound
of that bay area kush
she looked at me then looked
at it then she grabbed it
then she said get it understood
you know why we crack babies
because we born in the 80s
that adhd crazy
