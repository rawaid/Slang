me and my niggas tryna get it you bitch
hit this house lick tell me is you with it you bitch
home invasion was persuasive
from nine to five i know its vacant you bitch
dreams of living life like rappers do
back when condom wrappers wasnt cool
i fucked sherene then went to tell my bros
then usher raymond let it burn came on
hot sauce all in our top ramen ya bitch
parked the car and then we start rhyming ya bitch
the only thing we had to free our mind
then freeze that verse when we see dollar signs
you looking like an easy come up you bitch
a silver spoon i know you come from you bitch
and thats a lifestyle that we never knew
go at a reverend for the revenue

it go halle berry or hallelujah
pick your poison tell me what you do
everybody gon respect the shooter
but the one in front of the gun lives forever
and i been hustlin all day this a way that a way
through canals and alleyways just to say
money trees is the perfect place for shade and thats just how i feel
a dollar might just fuck your main bitch thats just how i feel
a dollar might say fuck them niggas that you came with thats just how i feel
a dollar might just make that lane switch thats just how i feel
a dollar might turn to a million and we all rich thats just how i feel

dreams of living life like rappers do
bump that new e-40 at the school
you know big ballin with my homies
earl stevens had us thinking rational
back to reality we poor you bitch
another casualty at war you bitch
two bullets in my uncle tony head
he said one day id be on tour you bitch
that louies burger never be the same
a louis belt will never ease that pain
but imma purchase when that day is jerkin
pull off at churchs with pirellis skirtin
gang signs out the window you bitch
hoping all of em offend you you bitch
they say your hood is a pot of gold
and we gone crash it when nobodies home

it go halle berry or hallelujah
pick your poison tell me what you do
everybody gon respect the shooter
but the one in front of the gun lives forever
and i been hustlin all day this a way that a way
through canals and alleyways just to say
money trees is the perfect place for shade and thats just how i feel
a dollar might just fuck your main bitch thats just how i feel
a dollar might say fuck them niggas that you came with thats just how i feel
a dollar might just make that lane switch thats just how i feel
a dollar might turn to a million and we all rich thats just how i feel

be the last one out to get this dough no way
love one of you bucket headed hoes no way
hit the streets then we break the code no way
hit the brakes when they on patrol no way

be the last one out to get this dough no way
love one of you bucket headed hoes no way
hit the streets then we break the code no way
hit the brakes when they on patrol no way

imagine rock up in the projects where them niggas pick your pockets
santa claus dont miss them stockings liquor spilling pistols popping
baking soda yola whipping aint no turkey on thanksgiving
my homeboy just domed a nigga i just hope the lord forgive him
pots with cocaine residue everyday im hustling
what else is a thug to do when you eatin cheese from the government
gotta provide for my daughter nem get the fuck up out my way bitch
got that drum and got them bands just like a parade bitch
drop that work up in the bushes hope them boys dont see my stash
if they do tell the truth this the last time you might see my ass
from the gardens where the grass aint cut them serpents lurking blood
bitches selling pussy niggas selling drugs but its all good
broken promises steal yo watch and tell you what time it is
take your js and tell you to kick it where a footlocker is
in the streets with a heater under my dungarees
dreams of me getting shaded under a money tree

it go halle berry or hallelujah
pick your poison tell me what you do
everybody gon respect the shooter
but the one in front of the gun lives forever
and i been hustlin all day this a way that a way
through canals and alleyways just to say
money trees is the perfect place for shade and thats just how i feel
