[chorus screwed pimp c sample from jay-zs big pimpin kendrick lamar]
smoking out pouring up keep that lean up in my cup
all my car got leather and wood in my hood we call it buck
everybody wanna ball holla at broads at the mall
if he up watch him fall i cant fuck with yall
pussy ass hoe niggas i cant fuck with yall
bitches all up in my business i cant fuck with yall
industry of counterfeits i cant fuck with yall

[kendrick lamar]
taking off when you landing
bitch niggas gonna throw tantrums
and im dancing on them stars
the galaxy aint got room for yall
aint nothing gonna happen soon for yall
while im here and every day i hear
your bullshit self-pity
reason why you never dealt with me
reason why your girl dealt with me
hands up in the building we get busy and say
r-i-p aaliyah r-i-p yep

[chorus]

[kendrick lamar]
look at my life then look at yours
get some ambition why you bored
time will never wait on no man
society will never hold your hand
niggas like to gossip like bitches

and a button on your lips dont blow my high

[chorus]
