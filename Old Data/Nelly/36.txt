i wipe my ass with yo advance to the toilet then flush it 
my last stance be a stance of a general custard 
i hot dog cause i can i got the cheese and mustard 
i got the stats of a hall of famer - in just two records 
thats why im back up at the superbowl - with julius peppers 
i got that caint stop wont stop in my veins 
thats why they caint stop wont stop screamin the name 
nelly nelly go tell a friend to tell a friend 
ima keep the same grin whether i lose or win 
up or down ten ima fight to the end 
breathing hard lets go 

chorus luve 
aint no way they can stop me now nelly 
cause im on my way i can feel my ring comin 
its the blood of a champion pumpin 
deep inside my veins too much pride to be runnin 
ima get what i can and more even if 
my blood my sweat and my tears dont mean nothin 
its the heart of a champion its the heart of me

and gettin buffer like michael riggs tell em again 
i gets buffer like michael riggs heard what i said 
the mv-p of the game intensity still the same 
im shootin out from my reign with peyton manning type aim 
cant stop me from scorin so they results are just hackin 
so theres three of us now - me ai and shaqn 
from the look to the as i say 
hover man with more heart than hallmark on valentines day 
im the one that youve been raven about like ray lewis 
i think it hard to go and change your route 
cause you dont know if im blitzin or if im sittin and readin 
waitin for you to go and trip drop back and throw up a brick man 
aint no way they can - blow aint no way they can - blow 
aint no way they can - blow aint no way they can - blow 

chorus 

nelly 
its like a big time decision made on how i can twurk it 
if hard work pays off then easy work is worthless 
my work habit aint no habit man i do it on purpose 
i push myself to the limit so my talentll surface 
so now its curtains and drapes on anybody who hates 
dislikin what im recitin bitin what ive been writin 
ive been dogfightin scratchin and clawin on every height 
tryin to make you remember me like you +remember the titans+ 
cause im a warr-ior my daddy was a soldier 
a vietnam vet lil derrty i thought i told ya 
im supposed ta whip up your town in testarossas 
heatin like folgers mayne im young black and rich 
as good as it gets and givin your point guard fits 
he think he done seen pressure mayne but he aint seen shhhh 
aint no way they can - blow aint no way they can - blow
