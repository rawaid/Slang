who am i you ask me you know its bout that grammar
from any state it dont matter from maine to montana
from white girls name anna to old ladies name nanna
they holdn up they banners and runn wit they cameras
can i get a flick you damn right miss
can i take a hit here boo like this
chronic sticky like gum i guess thats how it comes
dont worry bout my funds i play around it in one like ohh
when you seen that hummer but that was last summer
this year im much more blunter
more up close and personal its just gon get worser now
from prada to vokal the tics are too versatile
cant worry bout certain sounds that come out these haters mouths
i realize they cant help it just stay where you bown down
some more you cant get these pounds unless you gon smoke it now
if not i suggest you pack yo shit up and head out of town

whole aviat fat laces this world is rat races
headn back places but it still seem racist
got locations so i haul off the wall off if you could fall off
got a room at the wada wit a saw that ll take the wall off 
hit the mall off wit a sag hockey jersey du-rag
fitted still switchn two different shoes starchy wit tags
