playa curse put up on me now
we spreadin on my hommies like a germ
watch me turn into captain kill a hoe
fill a hoe strong
watch me last long like a penny broke many motels
i got a rich coupon
im doing dismounts on foutons
comin out like key won
i feel like ceramic in a hammoc

oohs and aahs slurred like a verb
someone acting like an ass like a metaphor
