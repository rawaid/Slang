good god almighty like back in the old days you know years ago they had the a&amp;r men to tell you what to play how to play it and you know whether its disco and rock but we just went in the studio and we did it we had champagne in the studio of course you know compliments of the company and we just laid back and did it so we hope you enjoy listening to this album half as much as we enjoyed playing it for you because we had a ball only real music is gonna last all the other bullshit is here today and gone tomorrow

cash rules everything around me
cream get the money

after hours of il mulino
or sotto sotto just talkin about women and vino
the contract like 91 dan marino
i swear this got michael rapino boostin my ego
overly focused its far from the time to rest now
debates growin bout who they think is the best now

i hear you talkin say it twice so i know you meant it
fuck it i dont even tint it they should know whos in it
im authentic real name no gimmicks
no game no scrimmage i aint playin with you niggas at all
my classmates they went on to be chartered accountants
or work with their parents but thinkin back on how they treated me
my high school reunion might be worth an appearance
make everybody have to go through security clearance
tables turn bridges burn you live and learn
with the ink i could murder word to my nigga irv
yeah i swear shit just started clickin dog
you know its real when you are who you think you are

cash rules everything around me
cream get the money
dolla dolla bill yall

fuck all that happy to be here shit that yall warned me on
im the big homie they still tryna lil bro me dog
like i should fall in line like i should alert niggas
when im bout to drop somethin crazy and i say im the greatest of my generation
like i should be dressin different
like i should be less aggressive and pessimistic
like i should be way more nervous and less dismissive
like i should be on my best behavior
and not talk my shit and do it major like the niggas who paved the way for us
like i didnt study the game to the letter
and understand that im not doin it the same man im doin it better
like i didnt make that clearer this year
like i should feel i dont know guilty for saying that
they should more mirrors in here so i can stare at myslef
these are usually just thoughts that i share with myself
but i thought fuck it its worth it to share it with someone else more than paris for once
