i can see it in your eyes youre angry
regret got shit on what youre feeling now
mad cause he aint like me
oh you mad cause nobody ever did it like me
all the care i would take all the love that we made
now youre trying to find somebody to replace what i gave to you
its a shame you didnt keep it alicia katia
i know that you gon hear this im the man
yeah i said it bitch im the man
dont you forget it
the way you walk thats me
the way you talk thats me
the way youve got your hair up did you forget thats me
and the voice in your speaker right now thats me
and the voice in your ear thats me
cant you see that i made it yeah i made it

and youre wasted with your ladies
yeah im the reason why you always getting faded

[rick ross - verse 2]
ok look im honest
girl i cant lie i miss you
you and the music were the only things that i commit to
i never cheated for the record back when i was with you
but you believe in everything but me girl i dont get you
she says i know you changed i never see you
cause youre always busy doing things
i really wish had a different way of viewing things
i think the city that were from just kinda ruined things
its such a small place not much to do but talk and listen
the men are jealous and the women all in competition
and now your friends telling you stories that you often misinterpret
and taint all your images of your mr perfect
i could tell that you been crying all night drinking all summer
praying for your happiness hope that you recover
this is one i know you hated when you heard it
and its worse because you know that i deserve it

[hook]

may your neighbours respect you
trouble neglect you angels protect you
and heaven accept you
