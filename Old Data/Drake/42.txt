[verse 1 the weeknd]
take your nose off my keyboard
what you bothering me for
theres a room full of niggas
what you following me for

this aint no fucking sing-along
so girl what you singing for
its cause we blowing like a c4
got my whole crew blowing like a c4

20 keep the bar rolling
fake ids and the trash we going
straight to the top rooftop glows
with a handful of girls and they all so foreign

rain so poisoned rainbows flowing
light-skinned chick first flight from poland
a whole lot of friends first flight from poland
a whole lot of girls first flight from poland 
why cause

[hook]
they loving the crew
they loving the crew
they loving the crew
they loving the crew
they loving the crew

[verse 2 drake]
smoking weed under star projectors
i guess well never know what harvard gets us
but seeing my family have it all
took the place of that desire for diplomas on the wall

and really i think i like who im becoming
theres times where i might do it just to do it like its nothing
theres times when i might blow like 50k on a vacation
for all my soldiers just to see the looks on all they faces all it took was patience

i got a lot of friends to come up off the strip for me
the same ones thatll come up off the hip for me
the realest niggas say your lyrics do shit for me
i told my story then made history

tell them imma need reservations for 20
ive never really been one for the preservation of money nah
id much rather spend it all while im breathing
that ovo and xo is everything you believe in i know

[hook]
they loving the crew
they loving the crew
they loving the crew
they loving the crew
they loving the crew

[outro]
cause we blowing like a c4
got my whole crew blowing like a c4
so broadcast that nigga we the news in the city
