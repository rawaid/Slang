how im feeling it doesnt matter
cause you know im okay
and still i ask myself why do you worry
you know you know im the same
i know i know you dont love me baby
time to take you away from me
only over my dead body

[drake - verse 1]
i think i killed everybody in the game last year man
fuck it i was on though
and i thought i found the girl of my dreams at a strip club
fuck it i was wrong though
shout out all to all my niggas living tax free
now-a-days its six figures when they tax me
oh well i guess you lose some and win some
long as the outcome is income
you know i want it all and then some
shout out to asian girls let the lights dim sum
shots came i dont know where they was sent from
probably some bad hoes about to take the hemp from
yeah you know me well nigga yeah
i mean you aint the only real nigga
they got me on these white women like seal nigga
slave to the pussy but im just playing the field nigga yeah
are these people really discussing my career again
asking if ill be going platinum in a year again
dont i got the shit the world wanna hear again
dont michael jordan still got his hoop earring in
man all of your flows bore me paint drying
and i dont ever be trippin off of what aint mine
and i be hearing shit you say through the grapevine
but jealousy is just love and hate at the same time
its been that way from the beginning
i just been playing i aint even know that i was winning
and this is the only sound you should fear
man these kids wear crowns over here and everything is alright

[hook]
i know i know you dont love me baby
time to take you away from me
only over my dead body

[drake - verse 2]
you say im old news where who the new star
cause if im going anyway its probably too far
just performed at a bar mitzvah over in the states
used half of the money to beat my brothers case
red wine over fed time
and shout out to the niggas thats doing deadtime
shout out to the bitches there when its bedtime
and fuck you to the niggas that think its their time
yeah dont make me take your life apart boy
you and whoever the fuck gave you your start boy
or you wanna be a muthafuckin funny guy
dont make me break your kevin heart boy
yeah its whatever you know feeling good living better
i think maybe i was numb to it last year
but you know i feel it now more than ever
my city love me like mac dre in the bay
second album im back paving the way
the backpackers are back on the bandwagon
like this was my comeback season back back in the day
and i met your baby moms last night
we took a picture together -- i hope she frames it
and i was drinking at the palms last night
and ended up losing everything that i came with
feel like ive been here before huh
i still got 10 years to go huh
this is the only sound you should fear
these kids wear crowns over here
and everything is all right
