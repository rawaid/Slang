[drake]
ive asked about you and they told me things but
my mind didnt change it i still feel the same whats
a life with no fun please dont be so ashamed
ive had mine youve had yours we both know

we know
they wont get you like i will
my only wish is i die real
cause that truth hurts and those lies heal
and you cant sleep thinking that he lies still

so you cry still tears all in the pillowcase
big girls all get a little taste aww
pushing me away so i give her space aww
dealing with a heart that i didnt break

ill be there for you i will care for you
i keep thinking you just dont know
trying to run from that say you done with that
on your face girl it just dont show

when youre ready just say youre ready
when all the baggage just aint as heavy
and the partys over just dont forget me
well change the pace and well just go slow

you wont ever have to worry
you wont ever have to hide
and youve seen all my mistakes
so look me in my eyes

[rihanna]
cause if you let me heres what ill do
ill take care of you
ive loved and ive lost

[drake]
its my birthday ill get high if i want to
cant deny that i want you but ill lie if i have to
cause you dont say you love me
to your friends when they ask you 
even though we both know that you do
you do

one time been in love one time
you and all your girls in the club one time
all so convinced that youre following your heart
cause your mind dont control what it does sometimes

we all have our nights though dont be so ashamed
ive had mine youve had yours we both know
we know

you hate being alone well you aint the only one
you hate the fact that you bought the dream when they sold you one
you love your friends but somebody shouldve told you something
to save you instead they say

dont tell me i dont care
if you hurt i wont tell you
you dont care if youre true

dont tell me i dont care
if you hurt i wont tell you
you dont care if youre true

[rihanna]
i know youve been hurt
by someone else
i can tell by the way you carry yourself
if you let me heres what ill do
ill take care of you
ive loved and ive lost
