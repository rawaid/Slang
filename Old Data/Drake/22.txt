i might be too strung out on compliments overdosed on confidence
started not to give a fuck and stop fearing the consequence
drinking every night because we drink to my accomplishments
faded way too long im floating in and out on consciousness

and they say that im back id agree with that
i just take my time with all this shit i still believe in that
i had someone tell me i fell off ooh i needed that
and they wanna see me pick back up well whered i leave it at

i know i exaggerated things now i got it like that
tuck my napkin in my shirt cuz im just mobbin like that
you know good and well that you dont wanna problem like that
you gon make someone around me catch a body like that 

no dont do it please dont do it
cuz one of us goes in and we all go through it
and drizzy got the money
so drizzy gon pay it

thats just something they know

they know they know they know 
they know they know they know

i even gave em a chance to decide 
now its something they know
they know they know they know yeah

i be yelling out 
money over everything
money on my mind
then she wanna ask when it got so empty
tell her i apologize happened over time
she says they missed the old drake girl dont tempt me

if they dont get it theyll be over you
that new shit that you got is overdue
you better do what youre supposed to do
im like why i gotta be all that
but still i cant deny the fact that its true

listen to you expressin all them feelings
soap opera rappers all these niggas sound like all my children
and thats how you thinking is about to come and make a killin
i guess it really is just me myself and all my millions

you know that they aint even got it like that
you gon hype me up and make me catch a body like that
cuz i live for this it isnt just a hobby like that
when they get my shit and play it i dont even gotta say it
