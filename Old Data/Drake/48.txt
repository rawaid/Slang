been a minute since weve slept together
gotta get myself together
ive been thinkin about everything
i dont know if its because im lonely
lonely on a wednesday night
girl im lonely
ill admit it if you just keep quiet
girl im lonely
that shit ain’t my fault girl
cause im lonely

name another woman aint no other woman that should comfort me
when i’m lonely
mixing remy little bit of henny
im running on empty im lonely
when i’m lonely when i’m lonely

heard you spend your summers in miami
at somebody’s house
that you didn’t buy
you’re young yeah have fun girl
but i hope it was worth it
cause fuck it i’m not here to judge
fuck it i’m not here to love
everything you did to ball
fuck it im just glad you called
ring ring ring what a thing
ring ring ring school bell i ring
you and i got options bae

name another woman aint no other woman that should comfort me
when i’m lonely
mixing remy little bit of henny
im running on empty im lonely
when i’m lonely when i’m lonely

this shit ain’t my fault
