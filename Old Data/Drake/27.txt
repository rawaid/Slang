whats up been a minute since we kicked it
youve been caught up with them bitches
i dont get it youre a star love
you shouldnt have to deal with that
ill never make you feel like that

cause i love me i love me enough for the both of us
thats why you trust me i know you been through more than most of us
so what are you what are you what are you so afraid of
darling you you give but you cannot take love

i needed to hear that shit i hate when youre submissive
passive aggressive when were texting i feel the distance
i look around the peers that surround me these niggas tripping
i like when money makes a difference but dont make you different
started realizing a couple places i can take it
i want to get back to when i was that kid in the basement
i want to take it deeper than money pussy vacation
and influence a generation thats lacking in patience
ive been dealing with my dad speaking a lack of patience
just me and my old man getting back to basics
weve been talking bout the future and time that we wasted
when he put that bottle down girl that niggas amazing
well fuck it we had a couple coronas
we might have rolled a white paper just something to hold us
we even talked about you and our couple of moments
he said we should hash it out like a couple of grown ups
you a flower child beautiful child im in your zone
looking like you came from the 70s on your own
my mother is 66 and her favorite line to hit me with is
who the fuck wants to be 70 and alone
yall dont even know what you want from love anymore
i search for something im missing and disappear when im bored
but girl what qualities was i looking for before
who you settling for who better for you than the boy hah

cause i love me i love me enough for the both of us
thats why you trust me i know you been through more than most of us
so what are you what are you what are you so afraid of
darling you you give but you cannot take love

thinkin about texas back when porsche used to work at treasures
or further back then that before i had the houston leverage
when i got summer a michael kors with my mommas debit
a weak attempt at flexing ill never forget it
cause that night i played her three songs
then we talked about something we disagreed on
then she started telling me how ill never be as big as trey songz
boy was she wrong that was just negative energy for me to feed off
now its therapeutic blowing money in a galleria
or beverly center macys where i discovered bria
landmarks to the muses that inspired the music
when i could tell it was sincere without trying to prove it
the one that i needed was kourtney from hooters on p street
ive always been feeling like she was the piece to complete me
now she engaged to be married whats the rush on commitment
know we were going through some shit name a couple that isn’t
remember our talk in the parking lot at the ritz
girl i felt we had it all planned out guess i fucked up the vision
learning the true consequences of my selfish decisions
when you find out how i’m living i just hope i’m forgiven
it seems like you don’t want this love anymore
i’m acting out in the open it’s hard for you to ignore
but girl what qualities was i looking for before
who you settling for who better for you than the boy huh

cause i love me i love me enough for the both of us
thats why you trust me i know you been through more than most of us
so what are you what are you what are you so afraid of
darling you you give but you cannot take love
