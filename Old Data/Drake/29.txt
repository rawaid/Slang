dropped a mixtape that shit sounded like an album
whod a thought a country-wide tour be the outcome
labels want my name beside an x like malcolm
everybody got a deal i did it without one

everyone who doubted me is askin for forgiveness
if you aint been a part of it at least you got to witness

and i will never stop like im runnin from the cops
hopped up in my car and told my chauffer to the top
life is such a fuckin roller coaster then it drops
but what should i scream for this is my theme park
my mind shine even when my thoughts seem dark
pistol on my side you dont want to hear that thing talk
let the king talk check the price and pay attention
lil wayne thats what they got to say or mention
im like nevada in the middle of the summer

no brake pads no such thing as last

eminem
there they go packin stadiums as shady spits his flow
nuts they go macadamian they go so ballistic whoa
he can make them look like bozos hes wonderin if he should spit this slow
fuck no go for broke his cup just runneth over oh no
he aint had a real buzz like this since the last time that he overdosed
they been waitin patiently for pinocchio to poke his nose
back into the game and they know rapll never be the same as before
bashin in the brains of these hoes and establishin a name as he goes
the passion and the flame is ignited you cant put it out once we light it
this shit is exactly what the fuck that im talkin about when we riot
you dealin with a few true villians who stand inside of the booth truth spillin
and spit true feelings until our tooth fillings come flyin up out of our mouths now rewind it
payback motherfucker for the way that you got at me hows it taste
when i slap the taste out of your mouths with the bass so loud that it shakes the place
im hannibal lector so just in case youre thinkin of saving face
you aint gonna have no face to save by the time im through with this place so drake
