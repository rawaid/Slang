one thing about music when it hit you feel no pain
i swear i got that shit that make theses bitches go insane
so they tell me that they love me i know better than that 
its just game
its just what comes with the fame

and im ready for that im just sayin
but i really cant complain
everything is kosher
two thumbs up ebert and roeper
i really cant see the end gettin any closer

but i probably still be the man when everything is over
so im ridin through the city with my high beams on
can you see me can you see me get your visine on
yall just do not fit the picture turn your widescreen on
and if you thinkin imma quit before i die dream on

they treat me like a legend am i really this cold
im really too young to be feelin this old
its about time you admit it who you kiddin
nobodys ever done it like i did it
