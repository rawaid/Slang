somewhere between psychotic and iconic
somewhere between i want it and i got it
somewhere between im sober and im lifted
somewhere a mistress and commitment
but i stay down girl i always stay down
get down have her lay down
promise to break everybody off before i break down
everyone just wait now
so much on my plate now
people i believed in they dont even show their face now
what they got to say now
nothing they can say now
nothing really changed but still they look at me away now
what more can i say now
what more can i say now
you might feel like nothing was the same

i still been drinking on the low
mobbin on the low
fuckin on the low
smokin on the low
i still been plotting on the low
scheming on the low
the furthest thing from perfect
like everyone i know

i still been drinking on the low
mobbin on the low
fuckin on the low
smokin on the low
i still been plotting on the low
scheming on the low
the furthest thing from perfect
like everyone i know

and i hate that you dont think that i belong to ya
just too busy running shit to run home to ya
you know that paper my passion
bittersweet celebrations i know i cant change what happened
i cant help it
i cant help it
i was young and i was selfish
i made every woman feel like she was mine and no one elses
and now you hate me
stop pretending stop that fronting
i cant take it
girl dont treat me like a stranger
girl you know i seen ya naked
girl you know that i remember dont be a pretender
getting high at the condo thats when it all comes together
you know i stay reminiscing
and makeup sex is tradition
but youve been missing girl
and you might feel like nothing was the same

i still been drinking on the low
mobbin on the low
fuckin on the low
smokin on the low
i still been plotting on the low
scheming on the low
the furthest thing from perfect
like everyone i know

drinking smoking fucking plotting
scheming plotting scheming getting money
drinking fucking smoking plotting scheming
plotting getting money

this the life for me
my mama told me this was right for me
i got em worried like make sure you save a slice for me
i should have spoons serve you up with a fork and knife for me
your actions make us doubt you
your lack of effort got me rapping different
this the shit i wanna go out to
play this shit at my funeral if they catch me slippin
naked women swimming thats just how im living
donate a million to some children thats just how im feeling
a nigga filling up arenas who the fuck can see us
i had to derrick rose the knee up before i got the re-up
yours truly the boy
i just build and build more
yall niggas build and destroy
you niggas party too much man i just chill and record
no filler you feel it now if you aint fill it before
yes lord this the shit i wanna go out to
this the shit i wanna go out to
