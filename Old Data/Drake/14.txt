rock me real slowly
put a bib on me
im just like a baby drooling over you
the things you do

these days im letting god handle all things above me
the things i cant change are the reasons you love me
listen you can hear them calling my name
im all over the place i cant sit in one place
im not ashamed at all
still findin myself let alone a soulmate im just sayin
feel like we one and the same our relationship changed
that or it never existed
whenever they say somethin bout us you listen
but fuck what they talkin about on your timeline
thats cuttin all into my time with you
fuck what they talkin about on your timeline
thats cuttin all into my time with you

rock me real slowly
put a bib on me
im just like a baby drooling over you
the things you do

she said youre my everything
i love you through everything
i done did everything to her
she forgave me for everything this a forever thing
hate that i treated like its a whatever thing
trust me girl this shit is everything to me
she from the jungle she from the jungle
i take somebody elses car drive there undercover
this shit is everything to me this shit is everything
dont know where we stand i used to hit you bout everything
are we still good are we still good
are we still good are we still good
if i need to talk are you around
are you down for the cause

are you down for the cause
you still down you still down you still down

rock me real slowly
put a bib on me
im just like a baby drooling over you

these days these new girls got me nervous
they go to school and do bottle service
they cant decide they keep switching majors
being indecisive makes me anxious
call your number and its out of service
who can i call for your information
what am i supposed to do after we done everything we do
who is your replacement
are we still good are we still good
are we still good are we still good
