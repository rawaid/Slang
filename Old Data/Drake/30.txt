isnt it amazing how you talk all this shit and we still lack communication
how beautiful our kids will be girl i dont need convincing
how every conversation starts with this time will be different
oh the ideas funny oh the ideas funny
oh the idea is so fun every time
at least we try for homerun every time

swanging eyes closed just swanging
same city same friends if youre looking for me
same city same friends if youre looking
ill be here just swanging
dont talk to me like im famous
and dont assume cause i dont expect assumptions babe
im just tryna connect with somethin babe
swangin

she just wanna run around the city and make memories
that she can barely remember
and id allow her talk about pussy power
she just wanna run over my feelins
like she drinkin and drivin in an 18 wheeler
and id allow her talk about pussy power
she used to say you can be whoever you want even yourself
yeah i show up knowin exactly who i was and never leave as myself
but when it falls apart im always still down
to pick a million tiny little pieces off the ground
cause you would learn to love people and use things
and not the other way around

swanging eyes closed just swanging
same city same friends if youre looking for me
same city same friends if youre looking
ill be here just swanging
dont talk to me like im famous
and dont assume cause i dont expect assumptions babe
im just tryna connect with somethin babe

i remember when my schedule was as flexible as she is
she call and tell me be here before the sun up
i be dressed before we hung up
i take eglinton to 401 east
and exit at markham road and the east end
where all the pretty girls are sleeping
my license been expired i renew it after the weekend
fuck i know i said that shit the last 7 weekends
girl i guess procrastination is my weakness
i hate stoppin for gas this late
cause this niggas creepin and i like how were creepin
summer is comin know you could feel it
20 on pump whatever i aint got enough to fill it
wont knock on your door
my uncle say you drive my whip like its yours
i got the pedal to the floor
im on my motherfuckin way swangin

dont fall asleep on me hang in there
ill be there just swangin
ill be there just swangin
i treat you good girl like youre famous
i know im late its always the same shit
but dont fall asleep on me hang in there
im on the road right now swangin girl
