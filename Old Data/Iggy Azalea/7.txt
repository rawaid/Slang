this twisted cat and mouse game always starts the same
first were both down to play then somehow you go astray
we went from nothing to something liking to loving
it was us against the world and now were just fucking
its like i loved you so much and now i just hate you
feeling stupid for all the time that i gave you
i wanted all or nothing for us aint no place in between
by me believing what you say that you never mean
like itll last forever but now forever aint as long
if it wasnt for you i wouldnt be stuck singing this song
you were different from my last but now you got a mirror
but as it all plays out i see it couldnt be clearer now sing

im gonna love ya until you hate me right
and im gonna show ya show what show what whats really crazy
you shouldve known better than to mess with me honey its all over with now
im gonna love ya im gonna love ya gonna love ya gonna love ya
like a black widow baby

im gonna l-l-l-love you until it hurts
just to get you im doing whatever works
you have never met nobody thatd do ya how i do ya
that will bring you to your knees praise jesus hallelujah
ima make you beg for it plead for it
till you feel like you breathe for it
till you do any and everything for it
i want you to fiend for it wake up and dream for it
till its got you gasping for air and you leave for it
till they have a cat scan on your mind and its nothin but me on it on it
now its me time believe that
if its yours when you want it i wouldnt promise i need that
till im everywhere that you be at
i cant fall back go quick
cause this here is fatal attraction so i take it all or i dont want shh
