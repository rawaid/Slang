yeah we dont wanna do anything to scare your children
thats the last thing we wanna do
we dont wanna scare anybody

never said it was fair but still i never knew fear
not in a million years could you tell me that id be here
i just hopped off that lier my life on another tier
lifting glasses for cheers keep that hating out my ear
from country living to county skipping this would drive you crazy
check the rate that they pay me a giant could never slay me
money never a maybe but never forgot my roots
i heard that the top is lonely i wonder if its the truth
so im just climbing paid off rhyming how im shining could be blinding
aint too much real left but right here is where you could find it
this that new classic aint this what you needed
im what amazing look like youll recognize it when you see it

know where i wanna be but im far from home
just tryna make it on my own
and unless they send me calls i dont answer phones
this is the line and i walk alone
aint no going back now
dont know where im at now
aint no going back now
this is the line and i walk alone

ive been counted out ive been stepped on
i was wide awake and got slept on
i had everything and then lost it
worked my ass off im exhausted
all this talking about me just talk about me
im here now they cant walk around me
im dedicated flow elevated
tell every hater hope you never play it said ill never make it
im celebrating and im never quitting no resignation
i took desperate measures out of desperation
im a fresh face with no expiration
i know pressure make diamonds so i threw em off in this chain
and when its all on the line
im who you want in the game
cause im gonna get it and its for sure
cant be like yall thats no go
international and yall local got this locked up just like po-po
every beat get a thats tocho
wont lose oh no thats yoko
been up and down like low lows
still make my own on the solo
had to be here to believe it
think like winners to perceive it
had to let you know that i mean it
if i speak it i say keep it
this flow thats genius
just think about it would i think about it
if i didnt live it wont ink about it
married to the money put a ring around it what

know where i wanna be but im far from home
just tryna make it on my own
and unless they send me calls i dont answer phones
this is the line and i walk alone
aint no going back now
dont know where im at now
aint no going back now
this is the line and i walk alone

and everything aint the way i planned it
but when the smoke clears im the one standing
this lifestyle can be so demanding
but i take off like a plane and i aint ever landing

know where i wanna be but im far from home
just tryna make it on my own
and unless they send me calls i dont answer phones
this is the line and i walk alone
aint no going back now
dont know where im at now
aint no going back now
this is the line and i walk alone

aint no going back now
aint no going back now
this is the line and i walk alone
