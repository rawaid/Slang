joint venture well partner up until the shares are up
and ill up your wages on a private island dolo
one across the cono
them broads before me was locals
through customs accustom your wardrobe damn

stamped passports where they all pass ports til the clocks fast forward
then we got blue shores where they dont do chores we just get chauffeured

damn this is the life
exclusive shit with all access granted
in the country where the accents are grand
and they landing on top of foreign mansions

you fly over in coach and fly back in a jet
hustle gang got your chest
