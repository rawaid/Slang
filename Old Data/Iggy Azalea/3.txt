walk a mile in these louboutins
but they don’t wear these shits where i’m from
i’m not hating i’m just telling you
i’m tryna let you know what the fuck that i’ve been through

two feet in the red dirt school skirt
sugar care back lanes
three jobs took years to save
but i got a ticket on that plane
people got a lot to say
but don’t know shit about where i was made
or how many floors that i had to scrub
just to make it past where i am from

no money no family
sixteen in the middle of miami
no money no family
sixteen in the middle of miami
no money no family
sixteen in the middle of miami

i’ve been up all night tryna get it rich
i’ve been work work work work working on my shit
milked the whole game twice gotta get it how i live
i’ve been work work work work working on my shit

now get this work
now get this work
now get this work
now get this work
working on my shit

you can hate it or love it
hustle and the struggle is the only thing i’m trusting
thorough bread in a mud brick before the budget
white chick on that pac shit
my passion was ironic and my dreams were uncommon
guess i gone crazy first deal changed me
robbed blind basically raped me
ran through the bullshit like a matador
just made me madder and adamant to go at em and even the score
so i went harder
studied the carters till a deal was offered
slept cold on the floor recording at four in the morning
and now i’m passion the bar like a lawyer
immigrant art ignorant
ya ill intent was insurance for my benefit
hate be inconsiderate but the industry took my innocence
too late now i’m in this bitch

you don’t know the half this shit get real
valley girls giving blowjobs for louboutins
what you call that head over heels

no money no family
sixteen in the middle of miami
no money no family
sixteen in the middle of miami
no money no family
sixteen in the middle of miami

i’ve been up all night tryna get it rich
i’ve been work work work work working on my shit
milked the whole game twice gotta get it how i live
i’ve been work work work work working on my shit

now get this work
now get this work
now get this work
now get this work
working on my shit

pledge allegiance to the struggle
ain’t been easy but cheers to peezy
for the weeks we lived out of duffle
bags is all we had
do anything for my mum i love you
one day i’ll pay you back for the sacrifice
that ya managed to muscle
sixteen you sent me through customs so

all aboard my spaceship to mercury
turn first at the light that’s in front me
cause every night i’mma do it like it’s my last
this dream is all that i need
cause its all that i ever had

working on my shit

now get this work

now get this work
now get this work
working on my shit
