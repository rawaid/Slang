right
i shoulda known you were bad news
from the bad boy demeanor and the tattoos
cause most guys only want one thing
but im undecided tryna figure out if thats you
either way though i think youre worth a test drive
cause ooh youre so much better than the next guy
and a little trouble only makes for a good time
so all the normal red flags be a good sign

don’t you come here thinking you’re ballin
aint down for it
you seem like trouble to me
i can tell by the way that you lean
and the way that you kiss your teeth
and you turn up so fresh and clean
smells like trouble to me

opposites attract i guess this it that
good girl bad guy what a perfect match
and if we ooo youre gon want to pay back tithes
cause when you finish you gon feel like you was baptized
see baby now you fiendin for a test drive
cause you dont wanna lose your ride to the next guy
and baby trouble only makes for a good time
so all the normal red flags be a good sign

don’t you come here thinking you’re ballin
aint down for it
you seem like trouble to me
i can tell by the way that you lean
and the way that you kiss your teeth
and you turn up so fresh and clean
smells like trouble to me

dear lord howd i get in this position and
i shoulda have never got involved in the first place
but second place never get the recognition hmm
see what he doin to me make have to shout it out

so clear now that hes a trouble starter
but i aint a saint neither and these aint no still waters hmm

dont mean no thing to me
till you show me where its at
smells like trouble to me
