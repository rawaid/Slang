ren
prisoner like a hostage yo
you shouldve covered your motherf**king head like an ostrich
deep in the dirt cause youse a sucker
and your ass up high so i can kick the motherf**ker
dont try to hang you best avoid
cause my footll be so far up your ass youll get hemorrhoids
before you try to f**k with ren
ill put two in your ass and youll be shitting in size ten

dre
first come first serve
who else got the nerves step up and give what you deserve
from the word of a motherf**king hip-hop maniac
braniac so what you oughta do is step the f**k back
now how the f**k you think a rapper lasts
with your ass aint shit that is said in the past
yo be original your shit is sloppy
get off the dick you motherf**king call-the-coppy

ren
falling deep in the drums with many of styles
thats one of the reasons a nigga ran a hundred miles
cheating and out beating the crowd i kept seating
but weak motherf**kers biting off and they kept eating
styles they got are full of bull cause their vocals are local
in nightclubs and not getting paid in full
they got the nerve to cuss
only reason niggaz picking your record is cause they thought is was us

dre
yo give em what i gotta give do em what i gotto do
you dont care for me so who gives a f**k about you
you cant harm me alarm me
cause were the generals in this f**king hip-hop army
the niggaz with attitudes if you didnt know
we blow flow and didnt move slow from the get-go
yo time for some taking
yo f**k this shit yella kick the break in

aaaah its the real thing
you are now real real niggaz niggaz

ren
you can run but you cant hide you know ima find ya
cause a nigga like rens only two steps behind ya
dont look back because youre shaking and all scared
a nigga in black can be your scariest nightmare
so sleep with the lights on forget that the mics on
dont step on the motherf**king stage with our nights on
dont see a psycho and then you just might go
mentally f**ked up when i let the rifle blow
dre
all these niggaz with the gibber-jabber
but couldnt kill a fly with a motherf**king sledgehammer
gangsters in black are out there
but only because yo its the shit that we wear
on my motherf**king dick
but ima love it when you drop like a motherf**king brick
so yo step up go to bed cause if youre misled
youll get a motherf**king bullet in your forehead

eazy ren
black the good the bad the ugly see


i love streetwise nigga you know me
rolling with some real niggaz playing for keeps
but you motherf**kers know who run the streets
with that hardcore hip-hop rap-shit
now how much harder can another nigga get
trying to be like us sound like us drift like us
ashes to ashes and dust to dust
so nigga nigga nigga nigga nigga nigga please
since youre on the dick why dont you drop to your knees
cause im a motherf**ker thats out to kill
eazy e a nigga thats real

ren
real niggaz straight off the streets of compton
quick to getting your shit without a second thought
and if your ass gets smoked its my bullet you caught
so if youre talking shit about the niggaz in black
bow down to the kings and raid a half
theyre played out thats what niggaz were chatting
one nigga left and they said we aint having it
people thought we was finished and done with
but if you think about it yo we really aint done shit
catch so cover your ears and wipe off your tears
and quit sniffing all over my dick for new ideas
and when the new record comes dont come like a f**king bum
asking for f**king money to buy you a f**king crumb
youre on the dick so far niggaz not one
and when it comes to dicks you dont even have one
so braze yourself to make sure you dont get f**ked up
cause if i let you slide its just cause youre locked up
dont come up my face again because ima floor ya
and if youre a bitch ima f**king ignore ya
because my attitudes a little bigger
cause mc ren is one of the real niggaz

dre
lost in the motherf**king world of madness sadness
but dre is just a nigga thats glad its
sucker motherf**kers like you making whack jams
because it only you shows you how dope i am
never try to ignore us
when im expressing stand still like youre full of riggermortis
cause im a real nigga but i guess you figure
you could break me take me but watch me pull the trigger
dre is just a nigga with heart a nigga thats smart
a nigga thats paid to say what others are scared to play
