you are now about to witness the strength of street knowledge

verse 1 ice cube 
straight outta compton
crazy motherfucker named ice cube
from the gang called niggaz with attitudes
when im called off 
i got a sawed off
squeeze the trigger 
and bodies are hauled off
you too boy if you fuck with me
the police are gonna have to come and get me
off your ass  thats how im going out
for the punk motherfuckers thats showing out
niggaz start to mumble 
they want to rumble 
mix them and cook them in a pot like gumbo
going off on a motherfucker like that
with a gat thats pointed at your ass 
so give it up smooth
aint no telling when im down for a jack move
heres a murder rap to keep ya dancing
with a crime record like charles manson
ak-47 is the tool
dont make me act a motherfucking fool
me and you can go toe to toe no maybe
im knocking niggaz out the box daily
yo weekly monthly and yearly
until them dumb motherfuckers see clearly
that im down with the capital c-p-t
boy you cant fuck with me
so when im in your neighborhood 
you better duck
cause ice cube is crazy as fuck
as i leave believe im stomping
but when i come back boy 
im coming straight outta compton

verse 2 mc ren 
[yo ren wussup tell em where ya from]
straight outta compton
another crazy ass nigga
more punks i smoke 
yo my rep gets bigger
im a bad motherfucker and you know this
but the pussy ass niggaz wont show this
but i dont give a fuck imma make my snaps
if not from the records from jacking or craps [ #1]
its like burglary the definition is jacking
or when illegally armed its called packing
shoot a motherfucker in a minute
i find a good piece of pussy and go up in it
so if youre at a show in the front row 
imma call you a bitch or a dirty ass ho
youll probably get mad like a bitch is supposed to
but that shows me what youre composed to [ #2]
a crazy motherfucker from the street
attitude legit cause im tearing up shit
mc ren controls the automatic
for any dumb motherfucker that starts static
not the right hand cause im the hand itself 
every time i pull a ak off the shelf
security is maximum and thats a law
r-e-n spells ren but im raw
see cause im the motherfucking villain
the definition is clear 
youre the witness of a killing
thats taking place without a clue
and once youre on the scope 
your ass is through
look you might take it as a trip
but a nigga like ren is on a gangster tip 
straight outta compton

verse 3 eazy-e 
[eazy is his name and the boys coming]
straight outta compton
is a brother thatll smother your mother
and make your sister think i love her
dangerous motherfucker raising hell
and if i ever get caught i make bail
see i dont give a fuck thats the problem
i see a motherfucking cop i dont dodge him 
but im smart lay low creep a while
and when i see the punk pass i smile
to me its kind of funny 
the attitude is showing;
nigga driving
but dont know where the fuck he going
just rolling
looking for the one they call eazy
but heres the flash  they never seize me
ruthless never seen like a shadow in the dark
except when i unload you see its fun to jump over a hesitation [ #3]
and hear the scream of the one who caught the lead penetration 
feel a little gust of wind and im jetting
but leave a memory no one will be forgetting
so what about the bitch who got shot fuck her
you think i give a damn about a bitch i aint a sucker
this is an autobiography of the e 
and if you ever fuck with me
youll get taken by a stupid dope brother who will smother
word to the motherfucker
straight outta compton 
damn that shit was dope


---notes---

[ #1] jacking the cracks a lyric that appears in some transcriptions seems nonsensical as does jacking the crops the lyric jacking or craps [game] seems improved because its consistent with the idea that ruthless villain mc ren would make money from his records or from stealing and gambling  having more industry than agriculture it is unlikely that ren is robbing farmers of their crops in compton Â p
[ #2] the current lyric what youre composed to doesnt make much sense  and this transcriber hears the word slut instead of what although that doesnt clarify the rest of the sentence
[ #3] possibly its fun to jump over a hesitation or a spark will jump over a hesitation or a spark can jump over a hesitation  this transcriber recalls a printed interview with nwa where they clarified this line with spark but the transcribers ancient memory is not sufficient for good data and the meaning of this line is still not clear
[ #4] this transcriber is positing that the lyric goes and hear the scream of the one who caught the leg penetration ie bullet wound  this transcriber can imagine an s phoneme just before penetration but the transcriber suspects that it might be a phantom phoneme from the 808 hi-hat  also the meaning of last penetration is not understood
