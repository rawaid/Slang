verse one eazy-e

i dont drink brass monkey like the beat funky 
nickname eazy-e your 8 ball junkie
bass drum kicking to show my shit
rap a hole in my dick boy i dont quit
crowd rocking motherfucker from around the way
i got a six shooter yo mean i am brave
rolling through the hood to find the boys
kick dust and cuss crank up some noise
police on my drawers i have to pause
40 ounce in my lap and its freezing my balls
hook a right turn and let the boys go past
then i say to myself they can kiss my ass
hip to get drunk got the 8 in my lips
put in the old tape marvin gayes greatest hits
turn the shit up had the bass cold whomping
cruising through the east side south of compton
see a big ass and i say word
i took a look at the face and the bitch was to the curb
hoes on my tip for the title im holding
eazy-es fucked up and got the 8 ball rolling

verse two eazy-e

riding on slauson looking for crenshaw
turned down the sound to ditch the law
stopped at a light and had a fit
cause a mexican almost wrecked my shit
flipped his ass off put it to the floor
bottle was empty so i went to the store
nigga on tip cause i was drunk
see a sissy ass punk had to go in my trunk
reached inside cause its like that
came back out with a silver gat
fired at the punk and it was all because
i had to show the nigger what time it was
pulled out the jammy and like a mirage
a sissy like that got out of dodge
sucka on me cause the title im holding 
eazy-es fucked up and got the 8 ball rolling

verse three eazy-e

olde english 800 cause thats my brand
take it in a bottle 40 quart or can
drink it like a madman yes i do
fuck the police and a 5-0 too
stepped in the park i was drunk as hell
three bitches already said eric your breath smells
40 ounce in hand thats what i got
yo man you see eazy urlin in the parking lot
stepped on your foot cold dissed your hoe
asked her to dance and she said hell no
called her a bitch cause thats the rule
boyz n tha hood trying to keep me cool
tell my homeboy you wanna kick my butt
i walked in your face and we get on up
i start dropping the dogs and watch you fall 
just dumb full of cumn got knocked out cold
make you look sick you snotty nosed prick
now your fly bitche is all over his dick
punk got dropped cause the title im holding 
eazy-es fucked up and got the 8 ball rolling

verse four eazy-e

and yall listen up close to roll call

eazy-es fucked up and got the 8 ball rolling
