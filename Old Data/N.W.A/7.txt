because you as the public you should know whats up
comptons in the house was more than gold it was a hit

but that was a part of showbizz
[dre]

[ren]
well for the record its ren and for the street its villain
and strapped with a gat its more like matt dillon
on gunsmoke but not a man of the law
im just the baddest motherf**ker that you ever saw
see i peep and then i creep on a fool
get my bloodpressure high but still stay cool
dig a grave of a nigga lookin up to me

so now lets get the motherf**kin session 
goin flowin its time to start throwin
rhymes so keep in mind all the suckers im blowin
cause im a start showin the time
never sayin im the best and just goin for mine
unlike a lotta suckers who claim theyre gettin busy
when their records only make good frisbees
you need to stop runnin off the mouth
stop and think before you put some whack bullshit out


its not difficult in fact its kinda simple
to create something funky thats original
you need to talk about the place to be
who you are what you got about a suck mc

[dre]+[ren]
this is portable something to f**k with yo ear
ren and dre will appear when the sound is clear
to f**k it up like we always do and thats the trick
sayin some shit to make the bitches wanna suck our dicks
but its an everyday thang
communicating to yall with the compton slang
comptons back in the house and your appartment
so open your door by the way so we can start it
test the monitors and call this mic
cause the way we feel were gonna f**k it up tonight
i got my mic in my hand with a hell of a grip
bitches screamin and shit now its a trip
waitin for the grand finale or the end
or stupid rhymes set be dre and ren
well like a kid we get new shoes and go faster
smilin like hell as we move past the
suckers the motherf**kers with the ego hype
cause were positive and theyre on a negative type
and if think were about to quit
