eazy
what you want is an unexpected approach
that may delay a suspects awareness of your presence
until you have a chance to assist the situation you are confronted

approach to danger dont move;
its hard to predict what will happen next
oh shit he has a gun drop the gun
you couldve prevented a tragedy

ren
you can approach but the danger-light is blinking
a self-desctruct button is activated when im thinking
this is a tribulation the weakened judge
the prophecy was fulfilled cause i never budge
i took up the tools crucifixion was the extreme
theyre seeing doubles of me but it wasnt a dream
one vision was of life the other was death
then i didnt give a f**k if death took your last breath
so you burn in my pit that i call hell
where you got send because your shit dont sell
my twenty-twenty was blurry from the smoke
of the niggaz that i burned and tormented but i didnt choke
i started doing em i kept on doing em
do em for shoot em up till that nigga ren was booing em
and my presence to the suckers was of a stranger
but f**k it they can approach to the danger

eazy
if you can be seen you can be hit
if you can be hit you can be killed
hes on the line shoot him

dre
fatal approach to danger just to remain a strangeler
outrun the shot of a gun with a ganger


murder in the first degree but its worse to be
a dead motherf**ker or a nigga in custody
with everybody thinking of death i kept working
to be one of the last niggaz left
so many people looking for hope theyre broke
without checking the fingerprints on the motherf**kers throat
a heart of steal can reveil the real nigga in me
so figuring to see the d-e-a-d
bodies like a niggas straight walking in a cemetary
so its very necesarry to carry ammunition for niggaz wishing
but they better take caution before dre goes off
and starts killing motherf**kers
just in order to change the anger for the real nigga
when i approach to danger

approach the motherf**king danger
come back to hell and send me some time this is it yall

eazy
final approach to danger death destruction around every corner
another dead body and you wanna keep running
but even the rain turns black
all you can do is stay alert to try to say out of the search-light
no prison nobody makes bail
everybody gotta go but see it aint no jail
think about death taking your last breath
heart beating like a motherf**ker like there aint no time left
for so many ways to stay up i gotta get mine
even though they wanna make a crime
yo im being real a better or latter in the beginning
because it will release the f**king police
f**k em i approach to danger
cause i dont give a f**k if somebody gotta get f**ked up
so you might as well kiss your ass goodbye
cause in the long run well all die
