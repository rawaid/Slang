listen to this
eazy e yo ren 
mc ren whassup 
eazy e take one mc ren yo hit it

mc ren
ruthless plenty of that and much more
so at the party ren is controllin the floor
that you step and do your danceroutine
it aint a dream my man youre in a gangsta scene
with a villain doin damage on a 24 track
with confusion to finish my conclusion
arhytomatic rhymes from a radio cat
you cant take what i got coz ill be takin it right back
ruthless gangsta cold killin
you wanna know what its means  definitionvillain
with the stupid dope rhyme
so once you hear one line you can tell its mine
with a baseball cap thats black that im wearin
and a look that keeps you all starin
and wondering why im invincible
but when you hear my rhyme its convincible
i dont take no shorts while im constructin the ground
that makes yall move around to my hell of a sound
girls drool on me like a dyin
drdre yo ren tellem what they do when you start rhymin
i go to the party i hip a hop the spot
i dunno what it is but the girls get hot
aspirin like theyre on fire and
their so-called boyfriends withem are retirin
and for this reason im a walkin threath
so when im on stage i wantssssht

eazy e quiet on tha set
light camera action
eazy e nwa take two

mc ren
now to get started with my musical profession
a gangsta or villain in mine is in session
the way that im referrin to this makes ya move ya butt
but dont stand in a daze yeah you should know whats up
anyway i keep the clappin along
coz nothing bad could go wrong because this song is so strong
 huh  im  who could ask for anything more 
when nwa is cold rockin the floor
like stupid actin like a retard
waitin for a bumrush gettin to the good part
it tips me so with temptation
writin my lyrics with this hyped information
just look at the center of the stage where the spotlight shines 
eazy e boy you should have known by now its mine 
unpredictable keepin you extremely enjoyed


its irresistable meanin that you cant avoid
and while im on stage look forward to sweat
but after i rip it up i wantssssht

eazy e quiet on tha set
light camera action
eazy e nwa take three

mc ren
i can be loud as hell think i will  never
ssssht eazy e quiet on tha set yeah i like that better
 huh  as what i can do  i think i earn respect
and if i didnt from you thats what i expect
coz if it aint ruff it aint me
so who really cares how you want me to be
see im just me standin at the top of the pile
and doin soft known tunes it aint my style
and this concludes our program
of how nwa makes a ruthless jam
now first we take an average drum
give it to dre and the boy gets dumb
its no secret that i sit alone at night
pick up a pad and pen and begin to write
all kinda lyrics thats promised to play
to make everybody say
they can be cold and ruthless no question about that
but sometimes its more complicated
eazy e yo dre you know what i want you to do 
public enemy bring that beat back bring that beat back

now mc ren is here workin like super glue
no matter what i do im always thinkin o you
coz im the pusher supplyin the fix
and this jams so dope it dont need a remix
but im makin obstacles of enemy traps
to catch any mcs with the weak-ass raps
crucifyin their  huh  like just for usin my name
the definition is pain but thats the thing o the game
if they try to retreat i catchem one at a time
coz theyre comittin a crime and still promotin a rhyme
so youre in the back of me just listen and learn
because youll all get a chance or maybe a turn
now my sideman wants to give a preview
so at my next concert i wanna see you
there not sittin in a chair
standin on yo feet with yo hand in the air
now im about to get out but ill be back
but next time expect the more funkier track
deep down for your enjoyment to hear more percussion
with lyrics thats smooth to start some discussion
the beat that im  hype  and you know thats bad
now continue to dance coz im thru with tha set
