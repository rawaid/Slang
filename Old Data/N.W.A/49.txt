yo man theres a lot of brothers out there
flakin and perpetratin who scared to kick reality
yo dre you been doin all this dope producin
you aint had a chance to show em what time it is
so watchu want me to do

im expressin with my full capabilities
and now im livin in correctional facilities
cause some dont agree wit how i do this
i get straight and meditate like a buddhist
im droppin flavour my behavior is hereditary
but my technique is very necessary
blame it on ice cube because he said it get funky
when you got a subject and a predicate
add it on a dope beat and itll make ya think
some suckers just tickle me pink to my stomach
cause they dont flow like this one
you know what i wont hesitate to diss one or two before im through
so dont try to sing this
some drop science well im droppin english
even if yella makes it a cappella
i still express yo i dont smoke weed or sess
cause its known to give a brother brain damage
and brain damage on the mic dont manage nuttin
but makin a sucker and you equal
dont be another sequel

express yourself
do it do
express yourself
oh do it

ice cube is not for the pop charts
so where should a brother like you start expressin yourself
my boyll show you how yo dre
watup
drop english right about now
gettin back to the pg
thats program and its easy
dre is back new jacks are made hollow
expressin niggers subject because they like to follow the words
the style the trend the records i spin
again and again and again
yo yall on the other end
watch a brother bringin dope rhymes with no help
theres no fessin or guessin when im expressin myself
its crazy to see people be what society wants em to be
but not me 
ruthless is the way togo they know
others say rhymes that fail to be original
or they kill where the hip-hop starts
forget about the ghetto and rap for the pop charts
and those musicians that cuss at home
but scared to use profanity when up on the microphone
yeh they want reality but chu wont hear none
they rather exaggerate a little fiction
some say no to drugs and take a stand
but after the show they go lookin for the dopeman
oh they ban my group from the radio here nwa
they say hell no
but chu know it aint all about wealth
as long as you make a note to express yourself

express yourself
do it do
express yourself
oh do it

a lyricist yo dre is the name for it
to make somethin dope on a record thats what he came for
kickin reality over stand us up
but its important to keep it in mind to express yourself
from the heart if you wanna start and move up the chart then 
expression is big part of it
you aint efficient when you flow you aint swift
movin like a tortise full o rigor mortis
theres a little bit more to show
i got rhymes in my mind embedded like a embryo
a lesson all bout expression
and if you start fessin i got a smith n weston for ya
i might ignore youre record because it has no bottom
i get loose in the summer winter spring and autumn
its dre on the mic gettin physical
doin the job nwa is the lynch mob
yes im macabre but chu know you need this
and the night i just gone just like a fetus
or tumor heres the rumour dres in the neighbourhood and hes up to no good
when i start expressin myself yella slam me
cause if i stay funky like dis im doin damage
or ima be too hype and need a straightjacket
i got knowledge and other suckers lack it
so when you see dre a dj on the mic
ask what its like its like we gettin hype tonight
cause if i strike it aint for your good health
but i wont strike if you just express yourself

express yourself
do it do
express yourself
oh do it
