lord i dont cry no more
dont look to the sky no more

now these pussy niggas putting money on my head

im the diamond in the dirt that aint been found
im the underground king and i aint been crowned
when i rhyme something special happen every time
im the greatest something like ali in his prime
i walk the block with the bundles
ive been knocked on the humble
swing the ox when i rumble
show your ass what my gun do
got a temper nigga gohead lose your head
turn your back on me get clapped and lose your legs
i walk around gun on my waist chip on my shoulder
till i bust a clip in your face pussy this beef aint over

many men many many many many men

have mercy on my soul
somewhere my heart turned cold
have mercy on many men

sunny days wouldnt be special if it wasnt for rain
joy wouldnt feel so good if it wasnt for pain
death gotta be easy cause life is hard
itll leave you physically mentally and emotionally scarred
this if for my niggas on the block twisting trees and cigars
for the niggas on lock doing life behind bars
i dont see only god can judge me cause i see things clear
quick these crackers will give my black ass a hundred years
im like paulie in goodfellas you can call me the don
like malcolm by any means with my gun in my palm
slim switched sides on me let niggas ride on me
i thought we was cool why you want me to die homie homie

many men many many many many men
wish death upon me
lord i dont cry no more
dont look to the sky no more
have mercy on me
have mercy on my soul
somewhere my heart turned cold
have mercy on many men
many many many many men
wish death upon me

every night i talk to god but he dont say nothing back
i know he protecting me but i still stay with my gat
in my nightmares niggas keep pulling techs on me
psych says some bitch dumb put a hex on me
the feds didnt know much when pac got shot
i got a kite from the pens that told me tuck got knocked
i aint gonna spell it out for you motherf**kers all the time
are you illiterate nigga you cant read between the lines
in the bible it says what goes around comes around
homie shot me three weeks later he got shot down
now its clear that im here for a real reason
cause he got hit like i got hit but he aint f**king breathin

many men many many many many men
wish death upon me
lord i dont cry no more
dont look to the sky no more
have mercy on me
have mercy on my soul
somewhere my heart turned cold
have mercy on many men
many many many many men
wish death upon me
