[intro]

[verse 1]
im a straight guerilla with it cold hearted killa wit it
any nigga gettin outta line can get it
i make it hot motherf**kers freeze up when i come through
mac-10 thirty two shot clip in my snorkel
i might smile and say whats up but i dont f**k with you niggaz
my rap money slow up ill run up on you niggaz
im on the edge im just waitin on a nigga to push me
put my hand on my strap what you lookin at pussy
we aint buddies we aint partners and we damn sure aint friends
so much chrome on my benz you see ya face in my rims
if your bitch wanna roll ima let her get in
i dont play but im a playa till the motherf**kin end {*gunshots*}

[chorus repeat 2x]
i got no pickup lines
i stay on the grind
i tell the hoes all the time
bitch get in my car bitch get in
i got my 64 ridin on dayton spokes
and when i open that do
bitch get in my car

[verse 2]

if your bitch really bout it nigga im gon take her
backseat of my jeep f**k till i f**k up her make up
take her to the diamond district introduce her to jacob
tell her if she like me she should keep me icey
my game f**k with a bitch brain till she think she wifey
spent a life savings in a day cause she likes me
committment for me uhh nah not likely
one hour vivica i thought i was onto somethin
but then the next week nah man it was nothin {*gunshots*}

[chorus]

[verse 3]
