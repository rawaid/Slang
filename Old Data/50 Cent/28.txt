damn niggaz switchin sides on niggaz just like that
u know me i stay wit a bitch on her knees
an give guns away in the hood like government cheese
spray on suzukis eleven hundred ccs
more plate on the back straight squeezing a mak
in the hood they identify niggaz by they cars
so i switch up whips to stay off the radar

i dont play that pussy shit i done told you boy
front on me you gon meet one of my soldiers boy
cousin twig shot up his mamma crib now he in jail
trippin off fliks of blue cantrell pussy and black tail

god grant me the serenity to accept the things i cannot change the courage 
the change the things i can and wisdom to know the difference
the a80ll make you say that
thats the prayer they burn in ya head when you in k-sac
man i might talk to you while we up in the pens
but when we come home dat dont mean we gon fuckin be friends
shells pass ya head close enough to hear em whistling
thank god they missed you an go grab ya pistol
in the hood niggaz runnin round actin crazy
buyin little air jordans for maybe babies
see it might be his an it might be yours
cause them broads in the projects is straight up whores

you aint can have em on they back or on all fours

because i hear what im sayin i know im killin this shit
