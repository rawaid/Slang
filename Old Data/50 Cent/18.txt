50 cent
chorus
ive been patiently waiting 
for a track to explode on yeah
you can get stunned if you want
and yo assll get rolled on its 50
it feels like my flows 
been hot for so long yeah
if you thinkin im a fuckin fall off youre so wrong its 50

50 cent
ive been pacing in my head
like a baby born dead
destination heaven
sittin politic with passengers from 9-11
the lords blessing left me lyrically incline
shit i aint even got to try to shine
gods a seamstress who tailorfitted my pain 
i got scriptures in my brain
i can spit at your dame
straight out the good book
look niggas is shook
50 fear no man warrior
swing swords like conan
picture me pen in hand
write lines knowin the source will quote it
when i die theyll read this
and say a genius wrote it
i grew up witout my pops
should that make me bitter
i caught cases and cocked out
does that make me a quitter
in this white mans world
im similar to a squirrel
lookin for a slut
wit a nice but to get a nut
if i get shot today my phone will stop ringing again
these industry niggas aint friends
they know how to pretend

chorus x2

eminem
youve been patiently waiting
to make it through all the hate
debating whether or not
you can even weather the storm
as you lay on the table
they operating to save you
its like an angel came to you
sent from the heavens above

they think they crazy
but they aint crazy lets face it
shit basically they just playing sick
they aint shit they aint saying shit
spray umh 50 [gun shots]

i bring dre and them wit me
and turn this day into fucking mayhem

im not trying to confuse you
when i let loose wit this uzi
and just shoot through your izuzu
you get the message
am i getting through to you
you know its coming
you motherfuckers dont even know do you
take some big and some pac
and you mix them up in a pot
sprinkle a lil big l on top
what the fuck do you got
you got the realest and illest killers
tied up in a knot
the juggernauts of this rap shit
like it or not its like a fight to the top
just to see who die for the spot
you put your life in this
nothing like surviving a shot
yall know what time it is
soon as 50 signs on this dot
shit what you know about death threats
cause i get a lot
shady records was 80 seconds
away from the towers
some cowards fucked with the wrong building
they meant to hit ours
better evacuate all children
nuclear showers theres nothing spookier
your now about to witness the power of fuckin 50

chorus

and you hear the shots go off

you see a nigga laid out
wit his fucking top blown off

if you live in a glass house
and if you got a glass jaw
you should watch your mouth
cause ill break your face

niggas wearin flags
cause the colors match they clothes
the get caught in the wrong hood
and filled up with holes
