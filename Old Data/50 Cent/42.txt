if i fell off tomorrow would you still love me
if i didnt smell so good would you still hug me
if i got locked up and sentenced to a quarter century
could i count on you to be there to support me mentally

if i went back to a hoopty from a benz
would you poof and disappear like some of my friends
if i was hit and i was hurt would you be by my side
if it was time to put in work would you be down to ride

id get out and peel a nigga cap and chill and drive
im asking questions to find out how you feel inside
if i aint rap cause i flipped burgers in burger king
would you be ashamed to tell your friends you feelin me

and in the bed if i use my tongue would you like that
if i wrote you a love letter would you write back

and we can go do what you like i know you like that
