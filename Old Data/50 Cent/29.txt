verse
niggaz wanna shine like me me rhyme like me me
then walk around with a 9 like me me 
they dont wanna do it 3 to 9 like me
and they aint strong enough to take 9 like me
hey yo you think about shittin on 50 save it
my songs belong in the bible with king david
i teach niggaz sign language that aint def son
*click* *click* you heard dat dat mean run
ask around i aint the one you wanna stun on pa
pull through ill throw a fuckin cocktail at ya car
from the last shootout i got a dimple on my face
its nothin i could go after mases fanbase
shell hit my jaw i aint wait for doctor to get it out
hit my wisdom tooth *huck-too* spit it out
i dont smile a lot cause aint nothin pretty
got a purple heart for war and i aint never left the city
hos be like fitty you so witty
on the dick like they heard i ghostwrite for pdiddy
you got fat while we starve its my turn
i done felt how the shells burn i still wont learn
wont learn

chorus 2x
if you get shot and run to the cop - you not like me
you aint got no work on the block - you not like me
its hot you aint got no drop - you not like me
like me dope you not like me

verse
moma said
everything that happened to us was part of gods plan
so at night when i talk him i got my gun in my hand

cause i fear when i kill a man god wont understand
i got a head full of evil thoughts am i satan

chorus 2x
if you get shot and run to the cop - you not like me
you aint got no work on the block - you not like me

verse
see i done been to the pearly gates they sent me back
the good die young i aint eligable for that
i shot niggaz i been shot sold crack in the street
my attitude is gangsta so i stand some beef
you wanna get acquainted with me you wanna know me
from 3 point range with a glock i shoot better then kobe
see a nigga standin next to me he probably my co-d
see a bitch gettin in my whip she probably gon blow me
see the flow is like a 38 its special yoooooo
a country boy tell ya im fittin to blowwwww
im more like a pimp then a trick you knowwww
see im in this for the paper i dont love the hooos
niggaz broke in the hood worried about mines
grown ass men wearin starter keyshawns
you know them little pieces with the little stones
got little clientele fiends call your cell phones
when the gossip starts im always the topic
you too old for that shit dog why dont you stop it
shorty i been watchin you watchin me
now tell me what you like more my watch or me
haha

chorus 2x
if you get shot and run to the cop - you not like me
you aint got no work on the block - you not like me
its hot you aint got no drop - you not like me
like me dope you not like me
