my life my life
makes me wanna run away
theres no place to go
no place to go
all the confusion
its an illusion like a movie
got nowhere to go
nowhere to run and hide
no matter how hard i try

50 cent
yeah 03 i went from back filthy to filthy rich
man the emotions change so i can never trust a bitch
i tried to help niggas get on they turned around and spit
right in my face so game and buck both can suck a dick
now when you hear em it may sound like its some other shit
cause im not writing anymore they not making hits
im far from perfect theres so many lessons i done learned
if money is evil look at all the evil i done earned
im doing what im supposed to im a writer im a fighter
entrepeneur fresh out the sewer watch me maneuver
whats it to ya the track i lace it its better than basic
this is my recovery my comeback kid

while you were sipping your own kool-aid getting your buzz heavy
i was in the fucking sheds sharpening my machete
sipping some of of that revenge juice getting my taste buds ready
to wolf down this spaghetti or should i say this spaghett-even
i think you fucking meatballs keep on just forgetting
thought he was finished motherfucker its only the beginning
hes buggin again hes straight thuggin fuck who hes offending
hell rip your vocal chords out and have them bitches plugged in the
motherfucking wall with 3000 volts of electricity
now take the other end dump them then plug them motherfuckers in each
one of your eye sockets cause i thought you might finally fucking see
thatll teach you to go voicing your cocksuckin opinion to me
i done put my blood my sweat and my tears in this shit
fuck letting up youre gonna end up regretting you ever betted against me
feels like imma snap any minute yeah its happening again
im thinking about the same
mother fuck everybody thats up in this bitch but 50
cause this is all i know this is why so hard i go
i swear to god i put my heart and soul into this more than anybody knows
im trapped so all i do is rap but everytime i rap im more trapped
and i rap myself right into this bubble oh oh i guess its bubble wrap
this is like a vicious cycle my lifes in a crisis
christ how was i supposed to know shit would turn up like it did
feels like im going psycho again
and i might just blow my lid

i havent been this fucking confused since i was a kid

maybe this is for me maybe
maybe im supposed to go crazy
maybe ill do it 3 am in the morning like shady
psycho killer michael myers im on fire like a lighter
tryna say the same classic get your ass kicked mad quick
wrap your head up in plastic pussy
now pick the casket dirt nap with the maggots
its tragic its sad its
never gonna end now we number one again
with that frown on your face and your heart full of hate
accept it respect it
this a gift god-given like the air in the lungs
of every fucking thing livin
