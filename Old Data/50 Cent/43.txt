man im gonna do my thing
its crazy in the club when im in there man
trust me homie im not playin
the dance floor of the chain i say get up

i came to bring you that california love
in the middle of new york
haters all of the above
im not playin i said im off the chain
you niggers better follow instructions i say get up

i ball till i fall
i stunt till i drop
im off the showroom floor
not the used car lot

you buy a bottle
i but the bar
i make any other week feel like mardi gras

when i get into i get into it
everybody cant do it the way i do it

i make it rain then the sun comes out
a nigger playin then the guns come out now

my question is who they goin to blame
when i back number one on that billboard again
shit chip now the game dont change
since mike made triller and prince made purple rain

i guess i make they kids want slangin
then nwa made the west coast bangin
nah its just music
man its just music
now get your ass on the dance floor and move it

i have the savoir-faire
im the reason everybody here i say get up
i make it hot i make it hot in here
your feet hurting i really dont care
i say get up
i wanna see i wanna see you move
and get on a little groove
i said get up
im getting money man i really dont care
now lemme see you put your hands in the air i say get up

you look good i want to get to know you better
you look good in them jeans and them red stilletos
you got a bentley coup booty baby i wanna drive
see i tell you what your mileage is just when im inside
i wanna take you for a spin you know round and round
switch gears until your love come down
i take you to the point of no return
if you listen you learn
just how a nigger earn
i got money to burn
while the game ban bitched
she dropped the bomb on me
she suck it down and up and down gracefully

rick james would have said she a brick house
but 50 you should go ahead and see what that bitch bout 
i found out she like hard i like it huh
back it up and get you some
i know how to get you sprung
tune you up
pierce your tongue
under the hood its so good
she said so good god damn im so good
nigga what up

i have the savoir-faire
im the reason everybody here i say get up
i make it hot i make it hot in here
your feet hurting i really dont care
i say get up
i wanna see i wanna see you move
and get on a little groove
i said get up
im getting money man i really dont care
now lemme see you put your hands in the air i say get up

and get into it
you now rock the building you know that
i said get up
and get into it
imma show you just how we do it
i said get up
aftermath still shady aftermath
i said get up
aftermath still shady aftermath
