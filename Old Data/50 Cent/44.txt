[chorus - akon]
ohhh
dont even look at me wrong when i come through the hood
aint nothin changed still holla at my homies
and when i hit the block i still will kill
and i dont want nigga but i will
if i got to kill
if niggas get to fuckin around if niggas get to fuckin around

[verse 1 - 50 cent]
respect come from admiration and fear
you can admire if you can catch one in ya wig
you see the testarosa the toasters right on my lap
so if a nigga get out of line a nigga get clapped
i got an arsenal a infantry im built for this mentally
thats why im the general i do what they pretend to do
front on me now nigga ill be the end of you
forget ya enemies and think of whatcha friendsll do
i drop a bag off then let a mag off
the heckler &amp; kochll tear half of ya ass off
im not for the games im not for all the playin
the hollow tips rain when i unleash the pain
get the message from the lions or get the message from the nine
paint a picture wit words you can see when i shine
put my back on the wall nigga watch me go for mine
i let twenty-one shots off at the same time yeah

[chorus - akon]

[verse 2 - 50 cent]
where im from death is always in the air homie
nanna love me so you know she say my prauers for me

hit the corners muthafuckas get left on
niggas know if not they better check my background

and i aint did no business wit em i dont owe these niggas

[chorus - akon]

[verse 3 - akon]
konvict
now tell me have you ever looked up at an instance
and seen a mac aimin atcha head mayne
before you know it life is flashin reminiscin
and ya body is drippin and full of lead mayne
i done been there i done cocked that
it aint never been a question im bout that
dont go there ya can cock that
and if ya plan to fuck around then reroute that
you never catch me ridin around on these streets
without a couple metal pieces under my feet
fully automatic weapons and loaded wit dumb-ds
stashed up under the carpet like a can of seabreeze
50 dont make me ride on these niggas
cause i will kill dip and hide on these niggas
50 dont make me ride on these niggas
cause ill be long gone like the ripper so

[chorus - akon]
