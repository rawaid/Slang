yea i need you i need you to hate
so i can use you for your energy
you know its real shit feel this

[verse 1]
americas got a thing for this gangstas shit they love me
black chucks black skullies leather pelle-pelle
i take spills over raymo shit ima fan
got that silver duck tape on my trey eight handle
the women on my life bring confusion shit
so like nino from new jack ill have to cancel that bitch
look at me this is the life i chose
niggaz around me so cold man my heart dun froze up
i build an empire on the low the narcs dont know
im the weatherman i take that coco leaf and make that snow
sit back watch it turn to dope watch it go out the door
o after o you know homey im just triple beam dreamin
niggaz be schemin im fiendin to live a good life
the fiends just fiendin
conceal my weapon nice and easy so you cant see
the penitentiary is definitely out the question for me

[chorus]
i want the finer things in my life
so i hustle hustle
nigga you get in my way when while im tryin to get mine
and ill buck you buck you
i dont care who you run with or where you from
nigga fuck you fuck you
i want to find the thing thats in my life
so i hustle hustle

[verse 2]
yea i dont know shit about gymnastics i summersault bricks
black talents start flyin when a nigga flip
i cook crack in the microwave niggaz cant fuck with me
man my cold days they called me chef boy are 50
check my logic smokers dont like seeds in their weed shit
send me them seeds ill grow em what they need
them aint chia pet plants in the crib thats chronic
and im sellin them 500 a pop god damn it
i sold everythin ima hustler i know how to grind
step on grapes put in water and tell you its wine
if you analyze me what youll find is the dna of a crook

what goes in my mind its contagious
hypnotic it sounds melodic
if the rap was the block or spider ill be that potent product
now get a load of me flashy far from low key
and you can locate me where ever that dope be gettin money man

[chorus]

[verse 3]
its a hustlers ambition close your eyes listen see my vision
mossberg pumpin shotgun dumpin and drama means nothin
its part of the game catch me in the coupe switchin lanes
in the jewels with your chains
i upgrade from 30 bs to clean vs
rocks that i copped procedes from the spot
i got the energy to win im full of adrenaline
played it perf and get nauseous watchin the spinner spin
i make plans to make it a prisoner of the state
now i can invite yo ass out to my estate
them hollow tips bent me up but im back in shape
pour cristal in the blender and make a protein shake
im like the east coast number one playboy b
hugh hefnerll tell you he dont got shit on me
the feds watch me icey they cant stop me
racist pointin at me lookin nigga ratchi
hello

[chorus]
