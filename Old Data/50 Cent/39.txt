[chorus- 50 cent]
all through the hood i keep hearin niggas sayin

[verse 1 - 50 cent]
this is nothin new i been in the position before
grandma crib niggas outside of her door
different day same shit old mac new clip
thirty two hollow tips gloves no rubber grip
im a boss but niggas never show no respect
i catch em slippin i have em tongue kissin my tec
wanna come test me pussy boy dont try
police responds never fast enough to satisfy
dont be stupid find out who you fuckin wit son
fore we find out where ya bitch gets her hair and nails done
its elementary life is but a dream
you know row row ya boat your blood forms a stream
after you get hit you shoulda thought about the shit
you took that paper you take a life or ya life get took bitch
sometimes i sit and look at life from a different angle
dont know if im gods child or im satans angel

[chorus - 50 cent]
all through the hood i keep hearin niggas sayin
im supposed to die tonight
niggas come put a hit out and they talkin like the shit okay
im down to ride tonight
we rollin whip stolen ak loaded
im down to ride tonight
we smokin straight locin locked and loaded
somebody gon die tonight

[verse 2 - 50 cent]
in 2002 if you asked me to make a wish
i simply woulda wished that my music would be a hit
big said damn niggas wanna stick me for my paper
and pray for my downfall i understand it all
but me im a little more flashy a nigga
so chances are ima have to blast me a nigga
im on that keflon vest shit that wild wild west shit
and eighty one 1 carrot stones in my necklace
i shine so hard i make mothafuckas wanna kill me
every projects and every hood i go they feel me
know it sounds like rap but this shit is real b
i dont talk that rich shit but nigga im filthy
when i come out to play had my mom been with me
you could bet your bottom dollar that revolver with me
homeboy frontin on me will shorten your life span
hold the mic with my left the knife in my right hand

[chorus - 50 cent]
all through the hood i keep hearin niggas sayin
im supposed to die tonight
niggas come put a hit out and they talkin like the shit okay
im down to ride tonight
we rollin whip stolen ak loaded
im down to ride tonight
we smokin straight locin locked and loaded
somebody gon die tonight
