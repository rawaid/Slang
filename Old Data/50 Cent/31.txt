first we get to talkin then we get to touchin
if we could pass the phone games well be fuckin
ill kiss you like the french before my tongue in your ear
do it like the dogs do it girl and pull on your hair
me in different scenery just means a different position
in a tub or in the sink i improvise now listen
in the chopper or in the jet you mile high club
im no fool i know money cant buy me love
but im a different type of nigga that make sure that you know
instead of a rose theres a hundred dozens of those
see i see something special when i look in your eyes
with your legs way back i say this pussy is mines
if you aint sure when im talkin i dont tell you no lies
but theres things that you say that have me wanderin why
when i dont say what im thinkin it dont mean that im shy
got on that shit that you picked for me thats why im so fly

[verse]
while you in your bubble bath i can wash on your back
when you puttin on your lotion i can help you wid that
i sit and think of things to say that may make you smile
or give you gifts from my heart to reflect my style
the slang i use when we bill may change how you talk
and if im focused when im strokin i can change how you walk
its the swagger that you come for but when you come from new york
im a hustler i just hustle in the things that i bought
separate me from the rest i feel like im the best
if theres a price to pay for feelin you i pay that twice
im as ghetto as it gets girl you know thats right
i aint got nutin to hide baby i tell you my secrets
for you end up bein around long enough to peep shit
i get closer to you i mean closer than close
i get into you after i take off my clothes
girl i been into you mentally long before

[chorus]
if i was your best friend i want you round all the time i want you round me all the time
can i be your best friend if you promise youll be mine girl promise youll be mine
please say hes just a friend uh huh
now girl lets not pretend come on
either he is or he aint your man haha
please say hes just a friend
if i was your best friend i want you round all the time i want you round all the time
can i be your best friend if you promise youll be mine girl promise youll be mine
please say hes just a friend uh huh
now girl lets not pretend come on
either he is or he aint your man haha
please say hes just a friend
if i was your best friend
