niggas screw they face up at me

i cock that aim that shit out the window
spray till there aint a shell left in my heat
ya niggas better lay down yea i mean stay down
get hit wit 8 round - ya ass aint gonna make it
you niggasll get laid out yuh blood and ya brains out

in my hoooooood

i dont trust a motherf**kin soul
when the ds come they fold

niggasll come to ya place put a gun in ya face
tell ya open the safe as ya heart start to race
cause a robbery can turn into a homo-case
