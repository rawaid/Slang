i heard paybacks a motherfucking nigga
thats why im sick of gettin treated like a goddamn stepchild
fuck a punk cause i aint him
you gotta deal with the nine-double-limb
the damn scum that you all hate
just think if niggas decide to retaliate
they try to keep me from running up
i never tell you to get down its all about coming up
so what they do go and ban the ak 
my shit wasnt registered any fucking way
so you better duck away run and hide out
when im rolling real slow and the lights out
cause im about to fuck up the program
shooting out the window of a drop-top brougham
when im shooting lets see who drop
the police the media and suckers that went pop
and motherfuckers that say they too black
put em overseas they be begging to come back
they say keep em on gangs and drugs
yyou wanna sweep a nigga like me up under the rug
kicking shit called street knowledge
why more niggas in the pen than in college

and tell the young people what they gotta know
cause i hate when niggas gotta live low

and dont give me that shit about role model
it aint wise to chastise and preach
just open the eyes of each
cause laws are made to be broken up
what niggas need to do is start loc-ing up
and build mold and fold theyself into shape
of the nigga ya love to hate
