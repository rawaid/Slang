big bird sesame street
hey look at this  i was cleaning out my nest
and i found a book of my old poetry

ice cube
fresh out of school cause i was a high school grad
gots to get a job cuz i was a high school dad
wish i got paid like i was rappin to the nation 
but thats not likely so heres my application
pass it to the man at at&amp;t
cuz when i was in school i got the a e e
but theres no sc for this youngsta
i didnt have no money so now i have to hunch the
back like a slave thats what be happenin 
but whitey says theres no room for the african 
always knew that i would boycott jeez
but welcome to mcdonalds can i take your order please
gotta sell ya food that might give you cancer
cuz my baby doesnt take no for an answer
now i pay taxes that you never give me back 
what about diapers bottles and similac 
do i gotta go sell me a whole lotta crack
for decent shelter and clothes on my back
or should i just wait for help from bush
or jesse jackson and operation push 
if you ask me the whole thing needs a douch
a masengel what the hell cracker sale in the neighborhood 
to the whorehouse bitches
miss porker little joe or todd bridges
or anybody that he know 
so i got me a bird better known as a kilo
now everybody know i went from po to a nigga that got dough
so now you put the feds against me
cause i couldnt follow the plan of the presidency
im never givin love again
cuz blacks are too fuckin broke to be republican 
now i remember i used to be cool
till i stopped fillin out my w-2
now senators are gettin hired
and your plan against the ghetto backfired 
so now you got a pep talk 
but sorry this is our only room to walk
cause we dont want a drug push
but a bird in the hand is worth more than the bush
