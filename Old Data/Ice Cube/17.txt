[airline attendant]
this is the final boarding call for flight 1259
departing from los angeles final destination to st louis
thank you

[ice cube]
damn g the spots gettin hot
so how the fuck am i supposed to make a knot
police looking at niggaz through a microscope
in la everybody and they momma sell dope
they trying to stop it
so what the fuck can i do to make a profit
catch a flight to st louis
thats cool cause nobody knew us
we stepped off the plane
four gang bangers professional crack slangers
rented a car at wholesale
drove to the ghetto and checked in a motel
unpacked and i grabbed the 380
cos where we staying niggaz look shady
but they cant fade south central
cos busting a cap is fundamental
peeping out every block close
seeing which one will clock the most
yeah this is the one no doubt
bust a u bone and lets clear these niggaz out

hey hey man whassup nigga
this is lynch mob nigga tires squeal

now clearing them out meant casualties
still had the la mentality
bust a cap and outta there in a hurry
wouldnt you know a drive-by in missouri
them fools got popped
took their corner next day set up shop
and its better than slanging in the valley
triple the profit making more than i did in cali
breaking up rocks like barney rubble
cos them mark-ass niggaz dont want trouble
and we aint on edge when we do work
police dont recognize the khakis and the sweatshirts
getting bitches and they cant stand a 
1991 tony montana
now the shits like a war - gang violence 
where it was never seen before
punks run when the gats bust
4 jheri curled niggaz kicking up dust
and some of them are even looking up to us
wearing our colors and talking that gang fuck 
giving up much much love
dying for a street that they never heard of
but other motherfuckers want to stand strong
so you know the phrase once again its on

[tv newscaster]
at the top of the news tonight
a gang from south central los angeles which are known for their drive-by shootings
have migrated into east st louis leaving 3 dead and 2 others injured no arrests have
been made police say this is a nation-wide trend with similar incidents occurring in
texas michigan and oklahoma

female voice repeating in background
if it can happen here it can happen anywhere


boom my homie got shot hes a goner black
st louis niggaz want they corner back
shooting in snowy weather
its illegal business niggaz still cant stick together
fuckin police got the 411 
that la aint all surf and sun
but we aint thinking bout them boys
feudin like the hatfields and mccoys
now the shits gettin tricky
cuz now they looking for tha colorz and the dickies
damn the spots getting hot from the platter
im about to pack up and start slinging in seattle
but the narcs raid about six in the morning
try to catch a nigga while hes yawnin
put his glock to my chest as i paused
went to jail in my motherfuckin drawers
tryin to give me fifty-seven years
facell be full of those tattooed tears
its the same old story and the same old nigga stuck
and the public defender aint givin a fuck
the fool must be sparkin
talkin about a double life plea bargain
you got to deal with the crips and bloods by hand g
plus the black guerilla family
and the white pride dont like northside
and its a riot if any more niggaz die
no parole or probation
now this is a young mans summer vacation
no chance for rehabilitation 
cuz look at the muthafucking years that im facing
imma end it like this cuz you know whats up
my life is fucked

police eat a dick straight up
