god damn the bigger the cap the bigger the peelin
and when dealin with the lench mob you gots to know
steady mobbin is not just the name of this jam but a way of life
bound together by motherfuckers thats known
to break em off somethin give it to me

four or five niggaz in a mothership
better known as a goose and we all wanna smother shit
bent front and back glass got tint
tryin to get our hands on some dollars and cents
and fools cant hold us
every chance we get we hittin up the rollers
comin up short of the green guys
and i might start slangin bean pies
or the bootleg t-shirt of the month
with u cant touch this on the front
im bout to get rich
cause life aint nuttin but money and fuck a bitch
they drop like dominoes
and if you didnt know ice cube got drama hoes
so after the screwin
i bust a nut and get up and put on my white ewings
im out the do
all you might get is a rubber on the floor
cause im ready to hit the road like mario andretti
bitch cause im steady mobbin

bustin caps in the mix
rather be judged by twelve than carried by six
cause im gettin major
fuck pac tel move to sky pager
told all my friends
dont drink 8 ball cause st ides is givin ends
fools get drunk and wanna compete
slapboxin in the street
niggaz get mad tempers are flarin
cause they got a few bitches starin
just for the nappy heads
but scandalous bitches make for happy feds
im making my duty to cuss em
out cause i just dont trust em
and if you tell on me im bombin on betty
bitch shoulda known i was steady mobbin

since one-time so hot
got me a stash spot in my hooptie for the glock
and im rollin on rims
eating soul food and neckbones from m&amp;ms
grumblin like a motherfucker
greasy-ass lips now i gots to take a shit
saw sir jinx bailin
when i hit a left i moved felon whattup loc
dont you know that niggaz get smoked
that take they life for a joke get in nigga
i take you to the pad zoom
went to moms house and dropped a load in the bathroom
jumped back in my low rider
comin out feelin about ten pounds lighter
went to bones house so i can get the gat
looking for the place where all the hoes kick it at
lench mob aint nuttin but tramps
but hoes lickin us like stamps
one fool brought the music for the yams
but ice cube had more amps get in bitch
cause i had the jam on
and i dont want to hear shit about a tampon
give me the nappy and make me happy
the hoe said pappy could you slap me
on the ass hard and fast
and could please try not to leave a gash
i said yeah but i dont play sex
when im putting on the latex
slipped on the condom
fucked around and dropped the bomb son
and it came out sort of like confetti
in for the night no longer steady mobbin
