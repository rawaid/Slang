you can run but you cant hide from the westside
night stalker shit talker run and tell them mr lm
nigga with the gat and im back
off the everyday prey that i slay
rolling with the fo chase ya through south-central
monkey-wrench hoes should know that shell get the balzac
cause im not staving but fuck that
johnny carson hoe never had me on the late night show
coming with the shit thatll hitch
steady mobbing cause the flavours good
there goes the neighbourhood brother with the 3rd album
how come he dont fall off 
rolling with the sawed-off gauge
turn the page of the chapter caught up in the rapture
but you know anita she can get the pita
eat em up yum and your flawed
rather burn billboard and the editor
here comes the predator

check your head for the new style
fuck lawerence powell and presino wynd and koon
pretty soon well fuck them like they fucked us and wont kiss em
riots aint nothing but dodge for the system
fighting with the beast no justice no peace
if any even if we fuck up denny
niggas are sick of your white mans tricks with no treat
thats right now its on on sight
you call me a muslim no im not a resident still got my vote in
farrakhan for president a white america im tearing ya
a new ass hole whos the nigga with the new black
strolling to your suburb house and i douse with gas
now whos cleaning up trash 
eat em up yum and your flawed
rather burn billboard and the editor
here comes the predator

get my black rag showing and im      
kiss my grips like    or mels diner
im meaner than a wicked wild hyena chasing antelope
put a chrome to your dome watch it bust like a cantelope
i cant stand a rope so dont try to hang em
talk about dogs boy i can sling em
ratta-tat-tat on your noggin
cause ice will cream your ass like     chocolate
i get crazy when i catch a rap
even be flipping the toungue like     das-efx
so who is ice cube 
im a rapper actor macker
got a little problem with the redneck cracka
get the polly whack her     is a devil shit-packer
coming with a crazy pitch
and the statue of liberty aint nothing but a lazy bitch
dont wanna give up the crack to the black
but you call it racial if we go and break the hoe
but eat em up yum and your flawed
rather burn billboard and the editor
here comes the predator
