fuck all yall

goddamn im glad yall set it off
used to be hard now youre just wet and soft
first you was down with the ak
and now i see you on a video with michelle
lookin like straight bozos
i saw it comin thats why i went solo
and kept on stompin
while yall muthaphukkaz moved straight outta compton
livin with the whitez
one big house and not another nigga in sight
i started off with too much cargo
dropped four niggaz now im makin all the dough
white man just rulin
the niggaz with attitude -- who ya foolin
yall niggaz just phony
i put that on my mama and my dead homiez
yella boys on your team so youre losin
aiyo dre stick to producin
callin me arnold but you benedict
eazy e saw your ass and went in it quick
you got jealous when i got my own company
but im a man and aint nobody helpin me
tryin to sound like amerikkkas most
you could yell all day but you dont come close
cause you know im the one that flown
ya done run 100 miles but you still got one to go
with the l-e-n-c-h m-o-b
and yall disgrace the c-p-t
cause youre gettin fucked out your green
by a white boy with no vaseline

[refrain]
ll sample now youre gettin done without vaseline  3x
biz markie sample damn it feels good to see peopleon it

the bigger the cap the bigger the peelin
who gives a fuck about a punk-ass villain
youre gettin fucked real quick
and eazys dick is smellin like mc rens shit
tried to tell you a year ago
but willie d told me to let a ho be a ho
so i couldnt stop you from gettin ganked
now lets play big-bank-take-little-bank
tried to diss ice cube it wasnt worth it
cause the broomstick fit your ass so perfect
cut my hair and ill cut them balls
cause i heard youre like givin up the drawers
gang-banged by your manager fella 
gettin money out your ass like a muthaphukkin ready teller
givin up the dollar bills
now they got the villain with a purse and high-heels
so dont believe what ren say
cause hes goin out like kunta kinte
but i got a whip for ya toby;
used to be my homie 
now you act like you dont know me
its a case of divide-and-conquer
cause you let a jew break up my crew
house nigga gotta run and hide
yellin compton but you moved to riverside
so dont front mc ren
cause i remember when you drove a b210
broke as a motherfuckin joke they let you on the scene
to back up the verse team
it aint my fault one nigga got smart
and they rippin your asshole apart
by takin your green
oh yeah --- the villain does get fucked with no vaseline

[refrain scratched]  

i never have dinner with the president---
i never have dinner with the president---
i never have dinner with the president
and when i see your ass again ill be blasting it
now i think you a snitch
throw a house nigga in a ditch
half-pint bitch fuckin your homeboys you little maggot
eazy-e turned faggot
with your manager fella ---
fuckin mc ren dr dre and yella
but if they were smart as me
eazy-e would be hangin from a tree
with no vaseline ---
just a match and a little bit of gasoline
light em up burn em up flame on
till that jheri curl is gone
on a permanent vacation
off the massa plantation
heard you both got the same bank account
dumb nigga what you thinkin bout
get rid of that devil real simple
put a bullet in his temple
cause you cant be the niggaz4life crew 
with a white jew tellin you what to do
pullin wools with your scams;
now i gotta play the silence of the lambs
with a midget whos a punk too
tryin to fuck me but id rather fuck you
eric wright
punk always into somethin gettin fucked at night
by mista shitpacker
bend over for the goddamn cracker
no vaseline
