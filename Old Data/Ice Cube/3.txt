break 
shit
yo
yo uh

just waking up in the morning gotta thank god
i dont know but today seems kinda odd
no barkin from the dog no smog
and mama cooked a breakfast with no hog damn

i got my grub on but didnt pig out
finally got a call from a girl i wanna dig out
whats up hooked it up on later as i hit the do
thinking will i live another twenty-fo

i gotta go cause i got me a drop top
and if i hit the switch i can make the ass drop
had to stop at a red light
looking in my mirror not a jacker in sight
and everything is alright
i got a beep from kim and she can fuck all night

called up the homies and im askin yall
which court are yall playin basketball
get me on the court and im trouble
last week fucked around and got a triple double
freaking niggas every way like mj
i cant believe today was a good day shit

drove to the pad and hit the showers
didnt even get no static from the cowards
cause just yesterday them fools tried to blast me
saw the police and they rolled right past me

no flexin didnt even look in a niggas direction
as i ran the intersection
went to short dogs house they was watchin yo mtv raps
whats the haps on the craps

shake em up shake em up shake em up shake em
roll em in a circle of niggas and watch me break em
with the seven seven-eleven seven-eleven
seven even back do little joe

i picked up the cash flow
then we played bones and im yellin domino
plus nobody i know got killed in south central la
today was a good day shit

left my niggas house paid what
picked up a girl i been tryin to fuck since the twelfth grade
its ironic i had the brew she had the chronic
the lakers beat the supersonics

i felt on the big fat fanny
pulled out the jammy and killed the punanny
and my dick runs deep so deep so deep
put her ass to sleep

woke her up around one
she didnt hesitate to call ice cube the top gun
drove her to the pad and im coasting
took another sip of the potion hit the three-wheel motion

i was glad everything had worked out
dropped her ass off and then chirped out
today was like one of those fly dreams
didnt even see a berry flashing those high beams

no helicopter looking for a murder
two in the morning got the fat burger
even saw the lights of the goodyear blimp
and it read ice cubes a pimp yeah

drunk as hell but no throwing up
halfway home and my pager still blowing up
today i didnt even have to use my ak
i got to say it was a good day shit

hey wait wait a minute pooh
stop this shit
what the fuck im thinking about
