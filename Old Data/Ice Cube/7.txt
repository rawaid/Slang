fool -- you know how we do it

west side

nothin but the west side

aint nuttin goin on but the bomb-ass rap song
hittin all night long
just like me on the black and white ivory
gettin six on artillery you dont want to see a g
break yo ass like dishes
buster-ass tricks sleep with the fishes
runnin from lennox up at venice
they wanna have me in stripes like dennis the menace
but that aint poppin aint no stoppin
fo-hoppin ass droppin coupe deville

so back on up fore i check that chin

you gets no love and i thought you knew it
fool you know how we do it

comin from the west side
west side comin from the west side

you gets no love and i thought you knew it
fool you know how we do it
