so when i come to your town dont crowd me
cause i know youre gonna wanna kick it with me
but i know none of yall can get with me
so you think youre protected

then i have to show and prove and use your groove
cause suckers cant fade the cube
and if i jack you and you keep comin
ill have you marks a 100 miles and running
