verse one ice cube 

little boys and girls they all love me 
come sit on the lap of i-c-e 
and let me tell ya a story or two 
about a punk-ass nigga i knew 
named jack he wasnt that nimble wasnt that quick 
jumped over the candlestick and burnt his dick 
ran up the street cause he was piping hot 
met a bitch named jill on the bus stop 
dropped a line or two and he had the hoe 
at that type of shit hes a pro 
so jack and jill ran up the hill to catch a lil nap 
dumb bitch gave him the claps 
then he had to go see dr bombay 
got a shot in the ass and he was on his way 
to make some money why not 
down on sesame street the dope spot 
there he saw the lady who lived in a shoe 
sold dope out the front but in back marijuana grew 
for the man that was really important 
who lived down the street in a air jordan 
ride to the fellow mister rogers and hoes 
drove a 500 sittin on lorenzoes 
he broke out little bo peep smoked out 
saw her and her friends sellin sheepskins 

[little bo peep] yo yo i got them sheepskins 
yo my empty sheepskins 
yo baby whats up with that 

hickory dickory dock it was twelve oclock 
cinderella aint home must be givin up the cock 
i dont doubt it she is kind of freaky of course 
had a fight with snow white she was fuckin her dwarfs 
saw a fight over colors too 
red riding hood and little boy blue 
a bad influence yo i dont know 
but ice cubell tell the kids how the story should go 

interlude little russ

verse two ice cube 

humpty dumpty sat on a wall 
with a joint drinkin some 8-ball 
three little pigs in a coup de ville 
lookin for the wolf to kill 
theyre fucked up and they want revenge 
them and humpty used to be friends 
now theyre enemies cause hes a traitor 
pulled out the uzi cruised by and sprayed him 
cinderella hoeing for the fellas 
and mister rogers is gettin mighty jealous 
of the cash that the pigs were makin 
time for the pigs to get turned to bacon 
cause mister rogers found out quick 
that humpty dumpty was blown to bits 
they said that the motherfuckin wolf was next 
so mister rogers better watch his step 
so he let the wolf know 
were gonna fuck up the pigs and take their ho 
cause cinderella is much too fast 
before twelve givin up ass 
double barrels all loaded and cocked 
as soon as they show they gonna get popped 
they bailed down sesame street and caught em 
little boy blue is up front givin orders 
little did they know cinderella was a fink 
she called the cops and got thrown in the clink 
a bad influence yo i dont know 
but ice cubell tell the kids how the stories should go
