turn on the radio take a listen
what youre missing
personally im sick of the ass-kissing
what im kicking to you wont get rotation
nowhere in the nation
program directors and djs ignored me
cause i simply said fuck top forty
and top thirty top twenty and top ten
until you put more hip-hop in
then i might grin but dont pretend that youre down with the c
and go and dis me in a magazine
how could you figure the brother could dig ya
dj face down in the river
no its not a threat but a promise
im as
crazy as they come see
mama didnt love me
all i got is my nine
and to calm the savage beast heres the alpine

turn off that bullshit
turn off that motherfucking radio
turn off that bullshit
turn off that motherfucking radio
turn off that bullshit
play the music motherfucker put the music on
damn

tune in to the radio listen for a minute
yo g stick a fucking tape in it
cause all the radio do is gangle
that r&amp;b love triangle
if youre out there kicking it with the brothers
you dont care about lovers
you wanna hear a young nigga on the mic
going buck wild
throwing and flowing and showing new styles
thats where im coming from
reality thats what theyre running from
so if youre down with ice cube let me know that you know
yo turn off the radio

you know what you know what 
basically those black guys and those rap guys
they dont know what the fuck theyre doing
i hate those fuckers
i hate em
especially that one guy
the amerikkkas most wanted
ice cube--i hate that fucker
get him off the air get him off get him off
get that rap shit out of here
just get me a gat so i can smoke this motherfucker
