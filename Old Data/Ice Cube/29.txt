but never chase it my game is so basic
as soon as i lace it - baby wanna taste it
just face it put me to the test
ice cube would ace it im built for success
fuck a rockstar we wanna party like a rap star
in the club in the house or the backyard yay-yay

and we get lap-dance from nuns 
they put away they crucifix
and they say ice cube - boy you the shit
