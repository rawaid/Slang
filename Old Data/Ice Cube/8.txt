to pull up pull off with some bad bitches
and it aint about chivalry
its about dope lyrics and delivery
its about my persona 
aint nothing like a man that can do wha he wanna
aint nothing like man on that you knew on the cornna
see em come up and fuck up the owner
see em throw up westside california

dumb nigga dont spend it as soon as you get it 
and recognize im a captain you a lieutenant

aint nothin to it gangsta rap made me do it
if i call you a nigga 
aint nothin to it gangsta rap made me do it
i can act like an animal 
aint nothin to it gangsta rap made me do it
if i eat you like a cannibal 
aint nothin to it gangsta rap made me do it

im raw as a dirty needle
choke an eagle just to feed all my people

plant thoughts in they mind just to defeat you
ice cube is a saga 
ya spit saliva and i spit lava

i heard nigga back in 1971

so if i act like a pimp 
aint nothin to it gangsta rap made me do it
if i call you a nappy headed hoe 
aint nothin to it gangsta rap made me do it
if i shoot up your college 
aint nothin to it gangsta rap made me do it
if i rob you of knowledge 
aint nothin to it gangsta rap made me do it

thank god when i bless the mic
you finally get to hear the shit that you like
a nigga talkin bout real life 
so you can try to get this shit right
use your brain not your back use your brain not a gat
its a party not a jack for real
dont be scared of them people
walk up in there and show them that you equal fuck them fuck them
and dont be material 
a nigga grew up on milk and cereal
i never forgot vaness and imperial
look at my life ice cube is a miracle
it could be you if you was this lyrical
it could be her if she was this spritual
cause me and allah go back like cronies
i aint got to be fake cause he is my homie

if i sell a little crack 
aint nothin to it gangsta rap made me do it
if i die in iraq 
aint nothin to it gangsta rap made me do it
if i take you for granted 
aint nothin to it gangsta rap made me do it
if i fuck up the planet 
aint nothin to it gangsta rap made me do it
