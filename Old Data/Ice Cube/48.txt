you cant trust a big butt and a smile

but the dating game aint what it used to be

they try to catch a dumb nigga in the act
you came to the club stepped to the bar
and pulled out a wad of doves
after you got buzzed she walk by
you saw how big her ass was
got her on the dancefloor
and she started dancin like a ho
jimmy got stiff she aint have a ride home
so you gave the bitch a lift
she didnt wanna trouble you
but hopped her big ass in your bmw
hopped to her house and started kissin
and jimmy just wouldnt listen
cos you got real horny
and that aint cool at four in the morning
started undressing the ho
got to the drawers and the ho said no
not on the first date
its gettin kinda late could you come back at eight 
you said yeah cos you thought you met a wholesome ho
but nigga she know you rollin in some dough
and youll regret and somethin bout a bitch you just met
dont trust em

interlude
scratching of bbds poison and pes dont believe the hype

eight oclock on the dot niggas hot
dick hard as a rock
straight on a solo creep
cant wait till her little boy go to sleep
so you can seduce the g
bust a nut and make an excuse to leave
you got her worked out cos you the man
but the bitch got diffrent plans
she said take off your clothes jump in the bed
while she powder her nose
you get butt naked cos you ready to wreck it
cos yous a motherfuckin punk next thing you know
the door flies open with a blast
with four niggas in ski masks
pointin a gun at the pimp
youre scared as a motherfucker and jimmy done went limp
they beat you down just a taste
take ya to your house and make ya open up the safe
drove you far tied up in the trunk of your own fuckin car
take you out and pop the cap
i told you the bitch was a trap
dont trust em
