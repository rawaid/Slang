murda murda murda kill kill kill
murda murda murda kill kill kill im going to kill [echoes]

[verse one method man]
slowly i turn step by step
through the backwindow i crept
silent as a mouse on a set
while everybody in the house slept
i disconnect the phones and the rest
find a butcherknife
cut the power lines to the lights
now a nigga wild for the night
i come like the living death straight from the dirt
back to avenge his own death on this earth
ever heard of jason then you know my work
down to the basement the dog get it first
i cant help myself my thoughts aint my own
the voices in my head just wont leave me alone
murda murda murda kill kill kill
pissing on the car seats flattenin the wheels
so theres no escape from the fate that awaits
no one to witness the horror taking place
yeah now im on my way up the stairs
to the bedroom on my prey unaware
heads will be hung from the chimney with care
with hopes that the police soon will be here
im a killer

[verse two redman]

fuck knocking kick the door evict the four

and eight fingers to square with joe young
