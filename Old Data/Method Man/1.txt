oh my god oh my god

[method man]
aaaow boo
uh uh yo uh
microphone checka swingin sword lecture
closin down the sector supreme neck protector
better warn em kid mr meths a boiling pot
about to blow his lid from the pressure too hot for tv
for cheesy too many wanna be hard be easy
its all ntogether going all out together 
it dont take much to please me 
still homes im never satisfy like the stones
we dont condone bitin see them selling crossbones
protecting what im writing
dont clash with the titan who blast with a license
to kill rap reciting
come on in the zone with ya nigga from the group home
tical fuck your lifestyle
*blows*
put your lights out
get the shit to crackin got you feenin with your pipes out
time for some action surfin the avenue
mad at you where i used to battle crews
back when antoinette had that attitude
cover me im going in walls closing in
got us bustin off these pistols
my niggas got issues again same song
armed with the mega bomb
blow you out the frame and then im gone

[redman]
yo i was going too but we roam cellular phones
doc-meth back in the flesh blood and bones
dont condone spit bank loans and homegrown
suckers break like turbo and ozone
when i grab the broom moon-walk platoon hawk 
my goons bark leave you in a blue lagoon lost true
three nines and a glove with nasu he dying in the car
while we behind on the bars
haters dont touch what weigh us both up
now my neighbor doped up got the cable hooked up 
all channels lift my shirt all mammal
you ship off keys and we ship grand pianos
sawed off shotgun hand on the pump 
sippin on a forty yo smokin on a blunt
bust my gun and red and meth gettin jumped
la la la la la la la laaaaa
yeah come on red and meth gettin jumped
la la la la la la la laaaaa
