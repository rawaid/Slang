first there was the collapse of civilization
anarchy genocide starvation
then when it seemed like shit couldnt get any more fucked up
we got the plague
the living death
closing his icy grip around the whole planet
then the rumors started
the last hardcore mcs were working on a cure
 that would end the pestilence why
i like the death
i *like* the misery
i like this world

space the final frontier
these are the voy-voy-voyages of the starship tical

as i walk in the shadow of death
sixteen men on a dead mans chest
your host this evening for h-o-t
n-i-x you get splashed with the tec
nobody go til the god say so
you got a second or mo to run for the do
before i blow back off the map contact
you didnt know stat could get down like that
who want them test rocket launcher yes
mr meth hold the fort most def
kids is dead wrong songs too long
get swung on cant we all get along
see my pinkie see my thumb
see that kid with the pump shot gun
bust your gums leave your whole shit numb
mmmm now whats this  smell like fish
mr big mouth the gat be trout
you need to douche out your style no doubt
johnny struck through the shaolin slum
prum prum prum on my shaolin drum
niggaz dont dare to step in the square
kids aint playin over here playa
only one way and thats my way
grim reaper callin judgement day
10 ten let the countdown begin 
9 i was born in the mind
8 take the head of a snake
7 behold armaggedeon
6 aint no love for the rich
5 only strong will survive
4 cause we live by the sword
3 plus sixty degrees
2 for the black and the blue
1 for the sun step into millenium
the name of this one is judgement day
no more bs cant come out and play
dont blame me blame society
type of chemistry for a live mc
hands in the air like you just dont care
you all get a share theres a party over here
year two-thousand keep bouncin
t-minus thirty seconds and countin
new yorks finest still wildin shaolin
at the full moon howlin
get til its gone killa bee kills
only time will reveal like the words in the song
cause loves what i feel for my crew bust steel
niggaz dont got to pay my bills
plo pack the slingshot flow
plant the seed let the garden grow
and stick that rhyme where the sun dont shine
darts pierce your heart like a valentine
tis my tale from the crypt thats sick
bloodbath body baths and shit
u-f-c fightin championships
gi joes with the kung-fu grip
now you dont dare to step in the square
kids aint playin over here playa
only one way and thats my way
grim reaper callin judgement day
