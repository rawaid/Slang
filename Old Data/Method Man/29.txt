scuse me as i kiss the sky
sing a song of six pence a pocet full a rye
who the fuck wanna die for their culture
stalk the dead body like a vulture
tical get hmmm
blacker than your blackest stallion
hit your housen projects
i represent the shaolin my nigga
hell yes apocalypse now the gun blow
it be goin down diggy diggy down diggy down down

verse two redman

while the planets and the stars and the moons collapse
when i raise my trigga finga all yall niggaz hit the decks
cause aint no need for that hustlers and hardcores
raw to the floor raw like reservoir dogs
the green-eyed bandit cant stand it
with more fruitier loops then that toucan sam bitch
plus the bombazee got me wild
fuckin with us is a straight suicide
how high so high that i can kiss the sky
look up in the sky its a bird its a plane
recognize johnny blaze aint a damn thing changed
how high so high that i can kiss the sky

verse three method man

10 9 8 7 6 5 4
3 2 murder 1 lyric at your door
tical bring it to that ass raw
breakin all the rules like glass jaws
nigga you got to get mine to get yours
fucka we dont need no rap tour
id rather kick the facts and catch you with the rap-ture
more than you bargained for
tical that stays open like an all nite store
for real i keeps it ill like a piece of blue steel
pointed at your temple with the intent to kill
and end your existance m-e-t
aint no use for resistance h-o-d

verse four redman

i shift like a clutch with the ruck
examine my nuts i dont stop till i get enough
6 million ways to die so i chose
made it 6 million and 1 with your eyes closed
the blindfold cold so you can feel the rap
and shatter the glass and second half on your monkey ass
and yo my man tical hit me now
bitches use to play me now they cant forget me now
forget me not i rock the spot check glock
empty off a lickin off a hip hop
fuck the billboard im a bullet on my block
how you dope when you payed for your billboard spot

chorus
look up in the sky its a bird its a plane
its the funk doctor spock smokin buddha on a train
how high so high that i can kiss the sky
verse five method man

til my man raider ruckus as i run around with a racist
my style was born in the 50 stair cases
dig it eff a rap critic
he talk about it while i live it
if red got the blunt im the second one to hit it

verse six redman

look up in the i got the verbs nouns and glocks in ya
enter the centa lyrics bang like rico-chet
rabbit i brings havoc with an a-k matic
rollin blunts an all day habit
i get it on like smifnwes
punks take a sip and test
who split your vest
the funk phenomenon
im bombin you like lebanon
blow canals of panama
how high so high that i can kiss the sky

look up in the sky its a bird its a plane
recognize johnny blaze aint a damn thing changed
how high so high that i can kiss the sky
