i done peeped a lota cats come through
courageous cats
stray cats ha ha
top cats with top hats
you know what im sayin
but it all boiled down to this
we talkin lyrics rhymes
line for line
numero uno who the best
i dunno

flame on i reign fire when johnny storm
im shocking like live wire
you have been warned
i prolong this next chamber to make it strong
and prove all them doubters wrong
killin em softly with this song
addin on
let them toes get they tag on
dead men run no marathon
on my shift
shootin that gift
know when he snitched
on the telethon
runnin his lip
sinkin his ship
give back what his mother gave em
mother made em and know she cant even save em
johnny blaze em
send em to his final restin
back to the essence
faces of death
the final lesson

torture torture torture
mother fuckin torture
yall niggaz know

who got john blaze shit
suckin my dick to get famous
so i switched blades to dangerous
welcome to my torture chambers torture chambers
where john does remain nameless

i know its def jam but think clearly
i made it possible for yall cats to come near me
keep your enemies close and your heat closer
i slam just like my culture on all theories
did that
straight of the meat rack with this one
you get burned playin with nic son
hot biscut
stand back
dont make me spit one
and paint pictures on the walls of your mental
with hot lead from out these pencils
iron lung since i was young
and not knowin where the next meal was comin from
been troubled son
to all those posin a threat
if i go everybody gotta go next
yall niggaz know
the code of the street souljah
im watchin time and time watchin me colder
grim reaper
breathin death on my shoulder
waitin for the day to take me over take me over

torture torture torture
mother fuckin torture
yall niggaz know

that you could never touch my flow
go head and hate me
still tryin fuck my hoe johnny come latelies
got me in a worlda shit
and now im pissed
mama said thered be days like this
tis the season for ducks
and my pens bleedin
leavin kids barely breath for sneak theivin
famished from lack of eatin and lack of teachin
banished from rhyme and reason for high treason
can it be
that the kid with the knot knees
got g to make a grown man cop plea
for this track i got a love bug like starski
blow back until i drop tical part 3
aint no stopin when you start me
john j pullin your car
mayday mayday
niggaz owe they life to god
and now its payday
take it how you wanna take it
fully clothed or butt naked
i learned the hard way aint nothin sacred
in this world time to face it
johnny basic instinct
im sure to make it while others fake it
fuck the spotlight
g-o-d already got light
say what you like
just spell my name right
no doubt this one goes out to all you trout-fish cake niggaz
keep my dick up out your mouth

torture torture torture
mother fuckin torture
