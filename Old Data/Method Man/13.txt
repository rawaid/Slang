chorus

plo style buddha monks with the owls
plo style buddha monks with the owls
plo style buddha monks with the owls
plo style

verse one method man

here comes the ruckus the motherfucking ruckus
thousands of cut-throats and crumb-snatching fuckers
straight from the brain ill be givin you the pain anger
coming from the 36th chamber bang 
tical hitting with the buddha-fist style
shotgun slamming in your chest piece plow
brain is blown all over the terrain
like a man without no arms you cant hang
time for a change of the guard
youve been arrested for lyric fraud now you barred
for real check it i pull strings like bb king on guitar
im the true fist of the north star

verse two carlton fisk method man

ooooooooh what a tangled web we weave
when first we practice to deceive
guns be clicking running with my clan we be sticking
whatever my street family stays together
represent what i invent killah hill
resident rest in peace to my nigga two cent
the street life is the only life i know
i live by the code style its mad plo
iranian thoughts are covered like an arabian
grab the nigga who on the spot and put a nine to his cranium

icantget no satisfaction niggas wont be lasting
long unless they get protection for real
strong coming with my clan so whats happening
commercial rap hate it with a passion

the m-e-t-h-o-d got me drinking oe all night in a mpv
just maxing looking for hoes you know relaxing
bitches know the hour it be time for some action

plo peace to that nigga barryano
word up lets take him to the bridge verrazano
