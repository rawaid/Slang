check it out yo
i be like yiggy yes yall doctor on call
ill rock til my name in graffiti on the wall
got flow like the rappers in great george
got weed i got blunt my name jamal
i pause flick the ash from my l
i pause like run and jason mizell
the emcee is me host for the night
papa doc only thing i dont choke on the mic
i choke a bitch out if my gwap aint correct
then with my giant hancock ill get the cheque
i love trucks but drop-tops is the best
from the beemers benz now rolex - watch me
haha she like red so cool
any nigga after me its a deja vu
doc stay in the paint like ai shoes
just watch how a one tonner made a move dig it

[chorus]
hop in my truck and roll up the window
a-yo you know what you in for
once we turn the corner light up the endo
a-yo a-yo a-yo
yes she with me getting low like a limbo
roll with gs and well show you how to get dough
third degree let it burn with my kinfolk
a-yo a-yo a-yo

who these corner store rappers slinging cracks in my hall
mamas in the kitchen cooking cat rat and dog
me i want a little something yall could have it all
i tryna walk before i crawl and move this package in my draws
thats why i push the pedal to the muhfuckin floor
with ten per cent method only plug something poor
and still i keep it funky like four plus one more
get this money like in god we trust trust your boy
its a given living this life it was written
especially for me im what the recipe is missing
blow my piff in the air key the ignition
then get to lane switching plucking ashes off the clip and
mammy wanna ride and play the bonnie to my clyde
if anybody try to kill bill itll probably be the bride
like all jokes aside im serious with mine
and now im on this grind like method man in his prime

[chorus]

yo i got my swagger on and i feel great
funk doc be in the hood like enfamil cases
i network on myspace real late
hoping my album make me another bill gates
around my crib look how i live
im a slob but crip niggas say i get biz
anywhere i did a show women saying that im
so aaaaaa-ma-zing

yeah another mic another night and the days end
another heist another kite in the state pen
my state business shit yall dudes just break wind
new york nigga either youre made mice or made men
i do the dirt that keep my hand on the work
i got the other hand up mona lisas skirt
my aim one since day one stop
how many shots will it take to make son drop

[chorus]

hey
