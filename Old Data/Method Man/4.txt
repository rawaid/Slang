thats why im with you to this day boo no frontin
even when the skies were gray
you would rub me on my back and say baby itll be okay
now thats real to a brother like me baby

and ima walk these dogs so we can live
in a fat ass crib with thousands of kids
word life you dont need a ring to be my wife

im realizing that cha didnt have to fuck with me
but cha did now im going all out kid
and i got mad love to give you my nigga

i got a love jonz for your body and your skin tone
five minutes alone im already on the bone

rockin three-fourths of cloth never showin your stuff off boo

i can be your noah you can be my wiz
then i can be your sun you can be my earth
resurrect the god through birth
