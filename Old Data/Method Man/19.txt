aint no tomorrows in the methods little shop of horrors
go ask your father who the father from the hill to harbor
you know tha saga marijuana blunts and goldschlager
with deadly medley yall aint ready for shakwon and reggie
dont even bother the radio for back-up - alright then

street life is triflin  body over here

straight from the catacomb the +children of the corn+
that dont got a +clue+ prepare for desert storm
