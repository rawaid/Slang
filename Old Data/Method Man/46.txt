[street life]
excuse me gorgeous

just maxin lookin for hoes yknow relaxin
met this redbone jasmine midtown manhattan
shot a verb that tranked her nerves calm words
massaged the mentals made her pussycat purr
sweet love you look miraculous brown eyes passionate
high cheekboned tommy girl cologne you smashin it
jump in take a spin destination staten
i have you home by ten shorty started laughin
she replied street you ever ride while you drive
i looked puzzled and said nah baby why
she pressed up grabbed my dick threw her dress up
cocked her legs cold fucked my head up
now im deep in it flyin past the speed limit
out of control still whippin it steadily hittin it
deep strokin one hand on the wheel blunt smokin
lovin how it feel sweet love you got me open what

[cappadonna]
love is love love love is love love
love is love love love is love love
we connected like a train from the first ordeal
i stepped to her with the passion as i kept things real
but like sex was on my mind like cum was in my pants
i flashed my fronts on her like if i had a chance
she said aint you cappadonna from the wu-tang clan
i said yeah mad gear plus the small white band
sweet love i want your pussy can i be your man
stripped to the bare essentials let me fuck you if i can
sweet love from your nipples to your pussy nub
sweet love love is love love is love love

[method man]
its a full moon we in the bedroom thoughts consumed
by the passion slow jam tunes and body action
my fingers on the clit splashin your pussy lips
got you spazzin love juices marinatin
in your satins sexy ass i get some like my old dad
i love my women bad with just a little touch of class
youse the star by far look at you ma
shake your thang-thang girlfriend you sheshe lefrea
whattup went to beat it up im not the one to eat it up
but the type to hit it raw dawg and seed it up
we talk without sayin nuttin you told me if i came through
youd gimme somin now we lockin ass
pullin hair and talkin trash how you like it
slow or fast  she said i like it when it last
no doubt you got the best trout there can be
not an everyday average chicken of the sea candidate for hiv
youd rather deal with monogamy
queen to be held black mahogany
youre bout to bust damnit sugar walls comin down
now you cant stand it youve been touched
thats when i felt the blood rush
gettin closer and closer with every thrust take me there
volcanos about to erupt i love you much
watch these rap niggaz get all up in your guts
