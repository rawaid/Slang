chorus/intro left eye and method man

rock a bye baby from the rooftop
when the guns blow your cradle gets rocked
when the earth quakes and the sky starts to fall
down will come emcees fake shit and all

verse one method man

after shot blow your bumba claat to smithereens

to even try and shit a turd

god hatin ugly in the worst way
fuck em like the earth say
from first day i survey the hassle
death knockin at your door

meth rotton to the core
shackle in the sound castle
the doungeon with vermin
in the form of emcees determined
to step foot on god soil
not knowin that these egg heads come hard boiled
and heavy handed
the aliens they just landed
and you in the way
overthrow these niggas planet
independance day
felons get split melons
homicide buck niggas get the buck with pelets
insecticide

as long as i pledge aligence to the dark side

verse two method man

times gon change nuttin will remain the same
million dollar broke niggas still fucked up in the game
make me wanna choke niggas shittin on my name
tuck your chain i approach nigga go against the grain now
hit the standin brain now
die hard fan call me john john mcclain now
snake vs the crane style
death to the enemy wu brother number one
the centipede trouble some
send em all to kingdom come
sun still shine one
time for your crooked mind
drunk off of cheap wine
son im in the street crime
every word every line
got juice very fine
turn me loose on mankind
detionate the land mine
funk gets me goin now
never sell never sold
live by the code now
never tell never told
darts i throw
like clyde with the finger roll
clut shots an what not
this is where the buck stops
still cant eat and yall still cant sleep
i eat up myÂ self as presidential emcee
wu-tang killa bee
the bee high facility
in love with the blunt smoke
even though its killin me
bad vibes fillin me
with thoughts of conspiricy
white water scandals with bill clinton hilary
too hot to handle
well put together to dismantle
fucka you heard me

[sample] 

hook two meth
