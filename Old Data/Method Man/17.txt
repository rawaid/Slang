intro rza singing by blue raspberry

*bees buzzing*
*man screaming in torture*

this is mr sandman bring me a good dream
serious the craziest
 d-da mr sandman bring me a good dream day-da
danger dangerous style

verse one rza

lyrical shots from the glock
bust bullet holes on the chops i want the number one spot
with the science of a giant
new york defiant brutal like domestic violence
silence of the lambs o-ccured when i slammed in
foes grab their chairs to be mad as ralph cramden
others come with shit as silly as art carney
but my tetley triplizes more kids than barney
never need for stress theres three bags of sess
a damn i rest playing chess yes
my thoughts be sneaky like a crook from brooklyn
when you aint lookin i take the queen with the rook then
i get vexed layin phat trax on ampex
morphous god gettin drunk off a triple x
violent time i got more love than valentines
the violent mind i blast with a silent nine

verse two inspector deck

my hazardous thoughts to cut the mics life support short
brains get stained like tablecloths when i let off
powerful poetry pushed past the point of no return
leavin mics with third-degree burns
let me at em i cramp your style like a spasm
track em through the mud then i bag em
were screaming hardcore hip-hop drips out my balls
and i be raw for four score plus seven more
i strike like a bowling ball holding yall hostage
like hail electrifying the third rail
peep the smash on paragraphs of ruckus
wu-tang clan aint nuttin ta fuck wit

verse three method man

hot time summer in the city
my people represent get busy
the heat-seeker on a mission from hells kitchen
i gets in where i fits in for head-touchin listen
enemy is the industry got me flippin
i dont give a fuck tell that bitch and a nigga
im killin snipin catchin murder cases
desert storm-in i be searchin for oasis
as i run a mile with a racist
pullin swords hit the billboard with a bullet
peace to the number seven
everybody else get the fo-nine-three-eleven
mr sandman bring me a good dream
i dont know whats going on
if you can take us there

verse four street thug

yo watch me bang the headpiece theres no survival
my flow lights up the block like a homicidal
murder underground beef for the burger
plo criminal thoughts you never heard of
i switch the city never sleeps lifes a bitch
i shit runnin through bitches like emmitt smith
caution niggaz best to be careful crossin
the street before they end up layin in a coffin
dont sleep niggaz tend to forget however
peep this -- my nigga case lives forever

verse five carlton fisk

what evil lurks in the heart of men
it be the shadow street-life flowin again
i had a plot scheme i knew for sure
only one kid would knock the hinges off the door
the jerk tried to jet sabrina at his neck
thirteen pounds on the table plus a tec
just when i said where the fucks the cream
another jerk came out the kitchen with the m-16
he tried to cock it blast these shots like rockets
crushed his collarbone ripped his arm out the socket
my move for the table was swift i got my hostage
the nigga tried to stab you god but i dodged it
niggaz said carlton youse a ill motherfucker
cause i made it look like they both killed each other
and im out

mr sandman bring me a good dream
mr sandman bring me a good dream
