god damn how real is this
i know them harlem niggas gonna be feeling this
east coast nigga but how trill is this
still dont give a shit my ignorance is still a bliss

[verse 1]
stone cold love
rose gold slugs
i could afford it
i imported stone cold drugs

stone cold rolling stone im a stoned nigga
write it on my tombstone i was stoned nigga

dont remember me as a wannabe new orleans nigga
slash lean sipping tennessee nigga nah
influenced by houston hear it in my music
a trill nigga to the truest
show you how to do this

my all gold grills give her cold chills
said shes got a coke feel cause im so trill
two dope boy scales what i sold hails
no l put her on her feet toe nails

them vampires them blood suckers them thirsty killers
we bout it bout it we rowdy rowdy that percy miller
for really real we chilly chill dont sport chinchilla
no bounty hunters im bout to killa im bout my skrilla

give me the title then give me the cash
fold it then bag it then move to the trash
follow my stash
stealing my swag
niggas is wickity wickity wack
like kriss kross
her lip gloss slip-ons get slipped off
my bitch boss cristal

we smoking then thinking then burning that hash
puff it and pass
making it last
walk in my shoes
and cross in my path

game was for grabs
making them crash
took in a section
and giving they back

[screwed]
fuck the money fuck the fame this is real life
the insights of my trill life
