i thought you said youd never leave
i think back as i took a puff
know what happens every time you wanna leave
always come back cause you wanna fuck
always come back cause you wanna fuss
holdin back aint no turnin back when you fall in love
know what happens every time you speed
always fall flat cause you wanna rush
so we could take it slow
separate the highs from the lows
separate the evens from the odds
i just hope you put me back together when i come apart

i come apart and you keep it together
i come apart and i cant stand the pressure
in all your grace and fire for me that i cannot compare
i come apart this cant last forever
cant last forever

i woke up today high
felt a little less pressure from you
and im here to say i
make it even under lessons from me
if you find a way to fight the pain which we endure
if you fly away then rest assured

i come apart and you keep it together
i come apart and i cant stand the pressure
in all your grace and fire for me that i cannot compare
i come apart this cant last forever
cant last forever

youre the eye but im tearing all the time
always there to catch me but im never coming down
reconstructing all the pieces i left in my way
i guess you know in control
chaos i create
i come apart

you made a bet with me now youre in debt with me
made my bed lied in it then you slept with me
its ruthless she the closest thing next to me
the truth is that she blew it and you left with me
especially hard to express to me
european attitude but born in west philly
she just have a smokin gina where the wet willies
i come apart im in her heart on the left titty

i come apart and you keep it together
i come apart and i cant stand the pressure
in all your grace and fire for me that i cannot compare
i come apart this cant last forever
cant last forever
