so thick you are shining like the star
with your head in the clouds some fighters shoot you down
hands on the ground back against the wall
tell me who you’d call when no one else around

tryina get on in this industry acting like your birthday
breaking down cocaine with the ebt
these male groupies doing it
however whatever they seeing on the box
everybody spit everybody hide
everybodies an artist everbody not
solost niggas talking dollars getting change
in a minute i’mma lose my crew scrit
well one give the full 98
like fuck coach i’m cutthroat so what goes
do you head for the year they say might be the end
better look within

glisten the glamors we pose for the cameras
ghetto niggas with me they pose with the hammers
ghetto girls with me pink toes in the sandals
no dirty laundry get your nose out my hamper
clothes in my hamper that bathing ape camouflage
brands from japan you would think i was a samurai
drop-crotch jeremy scott pants bitch it’s hammer time
getting dirty money but i keep my hand sanitized
life is what you need won’t you take a z feel the breeze
smoke the sour deeze hit that shit and please act at ease
wouldn’t you wanna be like the black eyed peas all these 3’s
star that’s hollywood won’t you rest in peace

so thick you are shining like the star
with your head in the clouds some fighters shoot you down
hands on the ground back against the wall
tell me who you’d call when no one else around
