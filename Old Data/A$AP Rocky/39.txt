[verse 1]
feelin out of place plus its gettin kinda late
tryna make it home safe and not get raped where you live
tina tummy ache gina got the funny face
monas sniffin dope so odomas leanin on the rib[]
i bet you wish you had a benz cause you just helped you friends
flag a taxi now you walkin not too far from your crib
cravin for an acid tablet for your satisfaction
said you feelin flabbergasted you just had to have it
made your way to 7th ave flagged a yellow cab
now you need an upper fast to help your mellow swag
black kid french braids and he keep it potent
hold ya purse dont trust him cause his teeth is golden
dice rollin reefer blowin in the streets he smokin
blowin weed while police patrollin
acid strips purple drink you can have a sip
have a fix of this acid drip

[hook]
hand on the dail kiss on the lips
eye for an eye drip for a drip
i getcha high please dont forget
i can supply the fix for ya drip
