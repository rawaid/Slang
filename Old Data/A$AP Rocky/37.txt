[verse one asap rocky]
i smoked away my brain i think i’m going dumb
cocaine up on my gums i think they’re going numb
i’m having stomach pains man i’m throwing up
cause i’m a microphone fiend
give me the bass give me the beat and let me lean
tap the vein let it stream feel the pain
young martin luther king with a dream
that one day that my team
we can make it with this rapping
now we swagging making money in manhattan
straight what’s happening
they try to intellect with indirection just to test you
a rebel until my death it’s in my flesh it’s in my vessels
fuck the clique you with
i’m finna fuck the bitch you next to
fuck a metrosexual suck a dick i’m disrespectful
you know the kid get it
get-get sick spit clip spit quick split shit hit kids women
oh that’s your girl huh well i just hit it
it’s a$ap nigga live with it

demons posted all around me i can’t beat ‘em all alone
these demon thoughts they start to drown me won’t they leave me all alone
demons posted all around me i can’t beat ‘em all alone
these demon thoughts they start to drown me won’t they leave me all alone

[bridge x3]
