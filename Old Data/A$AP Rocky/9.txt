uh uh i said it must be cause a nigga got dough
extraordinary swag and a mouth full of gold
hoes at my shows they be strippin off they clothes
and them college girls write a nigga name on they toes
niggas talk shit til they get lockjaw
chrome to ya dome til ya get glockjaw
party like a cowboy or a rockstar
everybody play the tough guy til shit pop off

lets take it to the basics
you in the midst the greatness
my martin was a maison rocked margiela with no laces
cristal go by the cases wait hold up that was racist
i would prefer the aces aint no different when you taste it
a 40 ounce to chase it thats just an understatement
im early to the party but my rari is the latest
