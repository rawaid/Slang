[chorus]
ooh i want it yeah
whenever you need my help
ill hold you down oh
ooh you want it yeah
when the fuck these niggas
tryin to hold me down

you such a fuckin lame
thats what they used to yell back in 7th grade
my mama said shed get me that new jacket when the cost go down
hit the office stole some tommy hill from lost and found
not bad for a family of foster child
lookin fly man im flossin now

but them niggas saw through me
are you serious what is this
took the jacket off third period
ellipses
listening to sky is the limit on my walkman
thinking if biggie can make it through it
man than i can
dope boy swag i always wanted that
but my persona was always more of that arthur ashe
but no love for the son of a commuter
who was a radiohead 
and okay at the computers at the post office

its funny how you smoke niggas
then you start coffins
all my people need throat lozenge
my fear is dead
ambition drove the hearse
when niggas get to feeling i aint black enough to go to church
culture shock in barber shops cause i aint hood enough
we all look the same to the cops
aint that good enough

the black experience is black and serious
cause being black my experience is no one hearing us
white kids get to wear whatever hat they want
when it comes to black kids one size fits all

[chorus]

we the baddest nigga
we the baddest nigga
yeah we the baddest nigga
we the baddest nigga come on
x 2

the reason that they say im nothing 
but they seen it hurts
the same reason will smith always opposite latino girls
they only see you how they wanna see you
til you make em see you in some other way
im trippin off the other day
cause god knows what these white kids say and do
youre not not racist cause the wires in your netflix queue

subtle racism its hard to pin it
cause youd only understand if you were me for just a minute
this one kid said something that was really bad
he said i wasnt really black because i had a dad
i think thats kinda sad
mostly cause a lot of black kids think they should agree with that
if youre a father you should stick around if you could
cause even if youre bad at it youll get tiger woods
or mj 
we warriors we all need senseis
change everything that we done so far

i dont mean make em bet t-e-r
i mean just the way we see each other
i wont stop until they say james franco
is the white donald glover
yeah these niggas want a cookie
but instead i gave em loch ness
sick boy for life my swag is in the hospice
aimin for the throne
jay and ye said to watch that
they ask me what im doing
and i say im stealin rock back
nigga
