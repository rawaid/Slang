i watch them all pass by
the moon and the stars
let me hold you in my arms
forever more

these cold nights
the park is ours
standing by the side
let you go oh to the sea just for me

dont ever let me my love
keep holding on
let the modest go
as my mic goes to and fro
waking up for one more show

we see him in the night
tell him im not afraid of him
im not afraid of them
cause i wont know
