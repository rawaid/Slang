now peter piper picked peppers but run rocked rhymes
humpty dumpty fell down thats his hard time
jack b nimble was nimble and he was quick
but jam master cut faster jacks on jays dick 
now little bo peep cold lost her sheep 
and rip van winkle fell the hell asleep
and alice chillin somewhere in wonderland 
jacks serving jill a bucket in his hand
and jam master jays making out our sound 
the turntables might wobble but they wont fall down

now dr seuss and mother goose both did their thing
but jam masters gettin loose and dmcs the king 
cause hes the adult entertainer child educator
jam master jay king of the crossfader
hes the better of the best best believe hes the baddest
perfect timin when im climbin im a rhymin apparatus
lotta guts when he cuts girls move their butts
his name is jay hear the play he must be nuts
and on the mix real quick and id like to say 
hes not flash but hes fast and his name is jay

it goes a one two three and 

jays like king midas as i was told
everything that he touched would turn to gold
hes the greatest of the great get it straight hes great
claim fame cause his name is known in every state
his name is jay to see him play will make you say 
god damn that dj made my day 
like the butcher the baker the candlestick maker
hes a maker a breaker and a title taker
like the little old lady who lived in a shoe
if cuts were kids he would beat you
im not lying yall hes the best i know
and if i lie my nose will grow 
like the little wooden boy named pinocchio
and you all know how the story goes
tricks are for kids he plays much gigs
hes the big bad wolf and youre the three pigs
hes the big bad wolf in your neighborhood
not bad meaning bad but bad meaning good

there it is 

were run-dmc got a beef to settle 
ds not hansel hes not gretel 
jays a winner not a beginner 
his pocket gets fat while others get thinner 
j-j-jump on jay like cows jump moons
people chase jay like dish and spoon 
and like all fairy tales end
youll see jay again my friend
