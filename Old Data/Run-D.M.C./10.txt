kings from queens from queens come kings
were raisin hell like a class when the lunchbell rings
the king will be praised and hell will be raised
s s s something tryin to faze ya but you wont be fazed
so whats your name dmc the king is me
your highness or his majesty
now you can debate ci ci ci concentrate
but you cant imitate dmc the great

dissin all devils causing havoc in hell
at a very high level bass and treble shall yell
heard in the heaven of a sound supreme
so clear to the ear it is sometimes seen
so loud like a cloud with thunder and lightning
so proud to the crowd it is somewhat frightening
no calm in a storm like a beast unleashed
theres no stoppin cause the rockin cannot cease
break

you see its harder than hard not one bit soft
courageous and contageous so you better break north
not a cold on a roll did you hear me cough
just listen when im dissing cause youre pissin me off
cold bedding is spreading all across your face
you can take when i break and if thats the case
i go on and on and kick the bass
so back up from the cup while i take my taste

its like a praise when the hell is raised
so demanding and commanding that you all stand dazed
the unbelieving receiving prophecies so true
i cut the head off the devil and i throw it at you
my mighty mic control already brought his soul
the rock king is so bold when he rocks and roll
a black cat is my crown symbolizing the sound
signifying we dont mess around
bust it

rappin and climbin beat makin every day
dont synthesize the sound so it sounds when i say
i am great get it straight cause thats my fate
my name is run im number 1
thats how i rate
hes in the place with the bass and styln grace
his name is j hes here to play and with his race
hes off the wall on the ball his name is d
kind of tall yes yall hes down with me

from the mountain valley to the deep blue sea
the word is heard as told by d
i dont sing i bring much delight
like a star shining bright in the darkest night
if you are cold ill bring you heat
like i brought the world my funky beat
mysterious is serious i aint no joke
fire from the depths of hell and you can smell the smoke

kickin and tickin while youre havin a ball
like chicken finger lickin ill be flickn you off
so do the bird have you heard did they give you a call
just me and dmc cold shakin the walls

theres no fearin when hearin sound of this kind
across the land every man is going out of his mind
on the face of the earth spreadin like a disease
contaminating infiltrating like a horde of bees

lord of lyrics duke of discussion
ruler of rock the king of col crushing
ruler of people controller of crowds
lingering lyrics long lasting and loud
left yall ah to the left yall 
because i rock upon the mic real def yall
and to the right yall ah to the right yall 
because i rock upon the mic all night yall

you see i want respect if im correct
theyre all like a ball that i have checked
and the shots they take have no effect
the pope tried to dunk but he broke his neck
cause i rock harder and i get farther
you want to battle d hey please dont bother
to waste your time messin with my rhyme
the only kick youll get out of it is in your behind
