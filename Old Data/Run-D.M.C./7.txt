for all you sucker mcs perpetratin a fraud
your rhymes are cold wack and keep the crowd cold lost
youre the kind of guy that girl ignored
im drivin caddy you fixin a ford
my name is joseph simmons but my middle names ward
and when im rockin on the mic you should all applaud
because were wheelin dealin we got a funny feelin
we rock from the floor up the ceilin
we groove it you move it it has been proven
we calmed the seven seas because our music is soothin
we create it relate it and often demonstrate it
well diss a sucker mc make the other suckers hate it
were rising suprising and often hypnotizing
we always tell the truth and then we never slip no lies in
no curls no braids peasy-head and still get paid
jam master cut the record up and down and cross-fade

because the rhymes i say sharp as a nail
witty as can be and not for sale
always funky fresh could never be stale

dmc
took a test to become an mc and didnt fail
i couldnt wait to demonstrate
all the super def rhymes that i create
im a wizard of a word thats what you heard
and anything else is quite absurd
im the master of a mic thats what i say
and if i didnt say that youd say it anyway

bust into the party come in the place
see the first things come the music in your face
tears down the walls some of the floor
with the dj named jay with the cuts galore

dmc
so listen to this because it cant be missed
and you cant leave til youre dismissed
you can do anything that you want to
but you cant leave until were through
so relax your body and your mind
and listen to us say this rhyme - hey
you might think that you have waited
long enough til the rhyme was stated
but if it were a test it would be graded
with a grade thats not debated
nothing too deep and nothing dense
and all our rhymes make a lot of sense

so move your butt to the cut

run-dmc

move your body to the funky sound

dmc

run-dmc
