id seen you jackin jc cause they got him most hazed
if you know about the ladies and all his babys
you diss on his rhymes a million times
and run around town like bonny &amp; clide
you see the move youre makin the rhymes youre takin
will lead the heart breaking and im not mistaking
you like his money to be his honey
if its truth you choose you break big dummy
dumb girl

dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb girl

i wish i knew why a girl like you 
was to do all the things that you do
i know you want a man but you should understand
jc aint d just be his fan
youre not this fine youre out of your mind 
and i wrote this rhyme just for your kind
dont be misled remember what i said
the rhymes of rappers surely not to take in your head

dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb girl

now you are the finest girl in the whole school
but they dont call you fly because youre a fool
because you dont go to class you will not pass
youd like to go but youre too slow because youre going to fast
and i can tell you are dumb when you walk in the place
walk around with your dumb cold suckin your face
always sinning never winning cause youve lost your race
you get high into the line think that measures the ace

dumb girl
use me the girl is
dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb girl

now youre a typical sexteen with no real power
ha you funk like this a battle with ya last medium shower
always guys call you fast but i gonna slow
always slipping or giving somebody a blow
giving every guy a try a way good to act
but theres a thing that youre missing
that you cant even buy
when it comes to love you even hit it by keep it
just silly did it dump did it just played stupid

dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb girl
use me stupid as 

i want you to listen to the words that i speak
about playing when im saying to never be weak
you should use you brain but you dont have one
and when it comes to sense you dont have none
yo yo you should know when i come with run
we tell this dumb di di dumb di di di di dumb dumb

dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb girl
dumb with a capital b
stupid as can be
right down
dumb
the girl is 
dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb girl 
the girl is dumb
