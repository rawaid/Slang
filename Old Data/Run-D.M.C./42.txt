[run] i would like to throw rock box in the start of this one
run dee run d m c
here we go again -&gt; chuck d*}

whats it all about [repeat x4]

livin in the city the crack the mack and all that
easy does it is it was it
the black or white that friday night
in those racist places lets get it right
ah to the maximum and keep askin um
when the city gonna fix where the blacks are from
and every day around the way another one got
bucked in his head from a gunshot
no chance in advance for the ambulance
cause he was just another victim of the circumstance
a brother died the mother cried it was a pity
but thats how it goes down when youre livin in the city

just a hard rock call him a hard rock
in the metropolis theres no stoppin this
cant agree with society poppin this
disagree with the plea when they coppin it
some men pretend the end will come soon
they gather what they can and them boom
you played yourself you made your wealth;
the deal was dealt now your health is in question
three card molly hoodlums who are we
pollution prostitution in god we
need a solution revolution substitution
for the things that were abusing
pity the city for the people livin out on the streets
yo we homeless the homeless need to eat
theres no progress for the rest
god bless for less

what it is
whats it all about
whassup g
what it be
how you livin homeless probably mandelas free
and theyre rollin with d
in history you cannot see em like they cannot see me
the berlin wall
it all had to fall
they said no but
yo yes whyall
the people that spoke were never provoked
and now its tumblin down
freedom of speech for each
now how that sound
try to stop me from sayin what i want to say
my funky rhyme i never quit until the break of day
now here we go as i flow and show and kick
infor-mation teach andÂ  reach inside the nation
and be a seer cause im reason with run
and now that the point is out
let the jam slam my man and tell me
whats it all about

i flex my muscle what i must do
is bumrush you fuck you ill crush you
the ku klux klan is fucked up
and every good manll understand
beginnin and winnin from the first fuckin vocal
i spoke to you i aint no joke to you
i do what i want to do
if you dont like what me and my crew is doin then fuck you
what i do and what i done with jay and run
none could ever become to sum it up bum
get off my dick and out my kingdom
yo yo d tell em where youre from
straight from hollis queens

i aint never goin out suckers
punk motherfuckers
whats it all about
