ho-ho-hoin what do you think on christmas itll be snowin
and people get their       for growin
you knowin were  in the ghetto theyre gettin nothin
no toys for little boys no curls for girls the turkey stuffin

they laugh they know they have no presents aint thick
you might just wanna ask wheres my present st nick
so think a little bout the people minus money
and when you get your dough why dont you show some kind of sunny

go head get fed and spread a little love
get what you can afford just like the lord from up above
a quote a note and when you wont believe
its better to give than to receive yo

its christmas no dissin listen all you listeners
think of all the prisoners thats in prison during christmas
not tryin to bring you down but tryin to put you up on
layin it on the table so youre able to put your cup on

no snow no not a flurry so hurry dont you miss it
not dissin you but wishin you a very merry christmas

give up the dough
give up the dough
give up the dough on christmas yo

give up the dough
give up the dough
give up the dough here we go here we go

im from the ghetto does this mean i get no toys or presents beneath my tree
i wrote my list i made my wish is this what christmas means to me
no snowflakes droppin cant go shoppin
rhymes are a-poppin to keep the hip-hoppin
why cant a santa pause for the cause

im gettin mine you gettin yours thats how christmas is supposed to be
a very merry christmas for everybody fight poverty give to the needy
dont be like the grinch cause the grinch is greedy
deck the malls with balls of holly tis the season to be jolly

no presents for my tree and i dont even know if any gifts im gonna get
happy holidays not like a lotta days a few here a few there to the new year
seasons greetings are the reasons for the cheer
if santa claus is coming to town hope its my chimney hes coming down
on christmas because christmas is
on christmas because christmas is

and if ya need a leader run be there for your blurry blurry sight
and write a rhyme for the night
christmas is a time for givin not for the tight

so open your pocket your heart unlock it
dollars straight from hollis i give it like i clock it
cold is the weather minus the humidity
dont mistake    for humility

christmas this must be the time of year
lego of your ego rather ego amigo be there
and here my dear so give a kid a beer
cause every time you give its coming back lets get it clear

ill be scopin and hopin brothers lend an ear
so have a merry christmas and a happy new year
