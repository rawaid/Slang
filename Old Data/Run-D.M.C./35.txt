[run-dmc]
tenement buildings and skyscrapers

[run]
are polluted and often invaded
with troubled hearts and weakened minds
living their lives and hoping to find
the golden key to prosperity
never have a grip on reality
this makes day to day living hard
trumpin your fate never peepin the card
you just goin through life without a trace
when the answers you seek are in front of your face

[both]	youre blind [2x]
[run]	tell em d

[dmc]
youre headed for the top or so you think
but thats not true for you your life is on the brink
of self-destruction total corruption
you better get out or die from consumption
sweat for a dollar to get nothin back
cause at the end of the week you still get taxed
youd even sell your soul to make your life correct
but with the rate of inflation you should eat your check
so you try to make a hustle to get ahead
but the only thing you manage is to stay in the red
coppin from john to sell to rex
and your jones for success has put your life in check

[both]	youre blind [2x]
[run]	and you cant see
[dmc]	you need to wear some glasses
[run]	like dmc
[both]	youre blind

[run]
so you think the facts means you cant win
so you devote your time to a life of sin

[dmc]
hangin out late is how you survive
makin deals talkin jive and tellin lies
pressure beatin you down
[run]	like youre not handlin
and all the while your mind is ramblin
[run]	about bein fly
or even sly
[both]	and bein held low in the public eye
you decide these things but you dont know why
[both]	youre standin on a corner cold playin the post
cause another sucker you were chillin the most

[both]	youre blind [2x]
[run]	yo you cant see
[dmc]	you need to wear some glasses
[run]	like dmc
[both]	youre blind [2x]

[dmc]	
you run round talkin bout what you hate
livin your life just to perpetrate
you think your style is chill because youre always cold
with your platform shoes and your fake gold
[run]	so you think youre bad
sheer dynamite
but if you only knew the crew called you freaks delight

[run]
wearin the tightest jeans and shortest skirt
you think youre cold chillin lookin like a jerk
no matter what you do come out second rate
[dmc]	thinkin youre on time but youre already late
youre blind

[run]	youre blind and you cant see
[dmc]	you need to wear some glasses
[run]	like dmc
[both]	youre blind
[run]	and you cant see
[dmc]	you need to wear some glasses
[run]	like dmc
[both]	youre blind

[dmc]	the moral to the story may not be clear
[run]	and the only way to catch it is to lend an ear
[dmc]	stop frontin so hard
[run]	why dont you peep your card
[dmc]	and your goals in life may not be far
because these words i say are meant for you to hear
so if you bust these facts you will persevere

[both]	youre blind [2x]
[run]	and you cant see
[dmc]	you needs to wear some glasses
[run]	like dmc
[both]	youre blind
[run]	and you cant see
[dmc]	you need to wear some glasses
[run]	like dmc
[both]	youre blind [2x]
[run]	and you cant see
[dmc]	you need to wear some glasses
[run]	like dmc
[both]	youre blind [2x]
[run]	and you cant see
[dmc]	you need to wear some glasses
[run]	like dmc
[both]	youre blind [2x]
[run]	and you cant see
[dmc]	you need to wear some glasses
[run]	like dmc
[both]	youre blind [2x]
[run]	and you cant see
