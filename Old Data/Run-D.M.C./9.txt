verse 1

one day when i was chillin in kentucky fried chicken
just mindin my business eatin food and finger lickin
this dude walked in lookin strange and kind of funny
went up to the front with a menu and his money
he didnt walk straight kind of side to side
he asked this old lady yo yo umis this kentucky fried
the lady said yeah smiled and he smiled back
he gave a quarter and his order small fries big mac

verse 2

today you won a ticket to see doctor j

round his back through the hoop then you scream touchdown
