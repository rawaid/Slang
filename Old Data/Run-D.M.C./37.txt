thats always under cover
and i talked til my daddy say
said ya aint seen nothin till your down on a muffin
and theres sure to be a change in ways
now theres a cheerleader
thats a real big pleaser
as far as i could reminisce
and the best thing lovin
was your sister and your cousin
and it started with a little kiss like this

she starts swingin
with the boys in school
and her feet was flyin up in the air
singing hey diddle diddle with a kitty in the middle
i was swingin like i just dont care
so i took a big chance at the high school dance
with a lady who was ready to play
it wasnt me she was foolin
cause she knew what was she was doin
when she told me how to walk this way
