ready for the war like a knight in my armor bomb ya 
so quick to test us nigga wanna crash me eat dust 
for the love of the lust niggas bustin on us
hit em up with he buck 12 gauge erupt its the art of war
putting niggas on the floor 
when im comin through the door bringin nothin but terror
causing much pain to the nigga that dared us 
trying to put a twist in this thugsta 
era paired up with a nigga like pac 
and a nigga like me gotta stay high
thug luv till i die keep my prayer to the sky 
but im still in the hood smoke and fry
so i beg the lord to save us all escapers of misery 
bless my niggas in penitentiaries soldiers of the century
