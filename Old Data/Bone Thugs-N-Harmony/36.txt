we paper chase and smoke blunts
youll never find a thuggish bunch of niggas like us
dont be so quick to test us ill be annoyed and might bust
ima have to talk to eazy through the ouija so i can see

everybody wanna party even the niggas with a problem
hey nigga we can solve em cause bitch well squash em

but you also got the clone styles and all mo t
see me rappin on your tv actin
and its a fact that when you see us in person think we gon flex or show you 
no action

so i figure ill slow down the rhyme
so they can understand i feel with so much anger and pain
and if i drop then ill explode like a fuckin grenade nigga
fuck calm time to ring the alarm

power to the people givin people the power to put it down in your city
and fuck them hillbillies
nigga i cant stand no mothafuckin po-po
when will we start killin these bitches and takin no more
mo thug the only clique that i claim

and then some chin checkers in the makin
so nigga continue with the rotation
