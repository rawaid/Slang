yo duke youre dead wrong
youll never have the skills like mine
i write the ill type rhymes
now im reaching my prime
360 dunk in your face
you cant compete youre just a basketcase
lets separate the men from the boys
and put your money where your mouth is
no time for toys
your game is weak get it so dont sleep
cuz ill be checking and wrecking ya
when i start to creep 
through the backdoor
i know i caught you out there 
you got no clout here
and i doubt there
is anyway that you can stop the beatdown
you better play the background
and sit back down 
chumps like you i gotta keepem in line
so prepare to suffer boy cuz now youre mine

ill fake you left and go right
straight down the lane
heres one in your eye
you feel pain you strain
to put together some strategy
but youre raggedy and ill be glad to see
the frown on your grill when i drill and thrill
set out my offense commence to kill
ill be leading from beginning to end
and after i guard ya
youre gonna wanna make friends
and make amends for the silly trash you were talking
take a walk and your shots im swatting
with ease and the ladies are swooning
clocking my swiftness why you drooling
you oughtta practice up and get your game with mine
i been waiting to guard you and now youre mine

hurry up sucker
go ahead and pick your squad
try to play hard but ima rob
you of your crazy notions to defeat me
your weak see
i rock all courts
and even get down to give you a rematch
after i wax and tax that butt
when i slam the alley-oop
you can rally troops
but i play the awesome defense
ill pick your pocket
and send you to the bench
with tears in your eyes as you realize
the prize is for me
yes all the money
son my flow is too nice
my handles precise
ill fake you right and go left
because my games so def and now youre mine
