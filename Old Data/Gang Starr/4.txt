verse one guru

no way youll never make it
come with the weak shit i break kids
step into my zone mad rhymes will stifle ya
lines like rifles go blast when i kick some ass
a lot of rappers be like one time wonders
couldnt say a fly rhyme if there was one right under
their noses i hate those motherfuckin posers
but im so real to them its scary
and with my unique skills nah you cant compare me
and no we dont make wack tracks
and all the suckers get pushed back when im kickin real facts
i represent set up shit like a tent boy
youre paranoid cause youre my son like elroy
and youd be happy as hell to get a record deal
maybe your soul youd sell to have mass appeal

verse two

oh yes im greater than all mcs when i breeeze give me room please
i be like fascinatin when i be updatin
cuttin off wack kids pullin their trump cards
i thump hard and make em say that im god
niggaz be pretendin they hardcore
never know the meaning of real hardcore
but i get props like a slogan and no man
could ever try to diss when i kicks my jam
lyrically def and connecting complete mic wrecking
no double checking vocals kill like weapons
but if i have to i go all out with no mic
yeah thats right cause i survived mad fights
and for my peeps i truly care
cause without some of them i wouldnt be here
and they all know how i feel
cause suckers be like playin themselves to have mass appeal

verse three

i know im dope but dont wet that
ive suffered setbacks but now im makin greenbacks
just like baggy slacks im crazy hip-hop
check one two and you dont stop
your headll bop when i drop my crop
of pure bomb just like the seashore im calm
but wild with my monotone style
because i dont need gimmicks
gimme a fly beat and im all in it
word is bond i go on and on
for you its tragic i got magic like wands
so ima end this lecture and i betcha
those who kick dirt and do time im gonna get cha
cause i be kickin the real
while they be losin the race tryin to chase mass appeal
