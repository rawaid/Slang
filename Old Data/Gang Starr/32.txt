many mcs are mislead
mislead by the lies that they pump in their heads
the money and the fame that theyre hoping to find
will never come close to the scope of my rhyme
now some have been succesful but really
and yo these mcs are clearly not nearly
up to this level or should i say caliber
because im hype that the companys selling me
because theyll take a dud talk some crud and then push him
but in the next year someone new will just squoosh him
because when you sell out to appeal to the masses
you have to go back and enroll in some classes
so cash in your check cause its the last one you get
the tables have turn and now you aint in effect
so jet to the rear and you better just follow
cause whats here today maybe gone tomorrow

here and gone in a flash some made cash
while other suckers go broke real fast
some never make any money but still they act funny
like theyre thinking theyre running
things wearing rings and medallions
then listen to their rhymes when we rather take valiums
cause swiftness and skills they are lacking
so i send them packing they should have know not to tax in
and smashing all of the vocals to smithereens
watching them collecting themselves cause theyÂ bitter seen
but some find happiness while others find sorrow
and whats here today maybe gone tomorrow
