its alongwaytogo when you dont know where youre going
you dont know where youre going when youre lost lost

guru
what you need is more direction and get yourself some protection
i thought by now that you have learned your lesson
im stressin points and slammin all joints you call the real shit
correct shit you know the busta way you feel shit
baby i still dont think you understand
you lose the game we get more props than danrather
and it dont matter cuz when you flinch youre weak
so imma step just to speak about the counterfeit unlegit type of people
those cellophane ones the ones that you can see through
its poetic justice cuz im mad with a pact
so precise my insight will take flight in the night
and in the daytime cuz i dont come up with corny rhymes
im too devoted to the concept of gettin mine
so heres the deal like shaquille oneal
if you dont know what youre doing how the hell can you be real

guru
now in 93 realistically you should bewell aware of all the evils out
there
its like a jungle sometimes you get the message
you got to rumble sometimes its gettin hectic
emotions run deep as times run out
solutionsits time to find some out
so according to me suckers are barred
&gt;from obstructing my discussion cuz i rhyme too hard
you take a wiff like a spliff here like some fresh air
i came to claim shit this year this year
so take a stroll down the walkway or hallway or runway
fuck with us kid youll pay
i slayand yo im still on the expressway
i kick my essay then you know we dont play
so pray down on your knees g
cuz its the best way yes the best way cuz

time to pay your dues you fools
im like express mail with the script that hits
like the third rail when i shock the spot its hot
&gt;from the rays of the sun
original one the prophet sent to become
a law giver cuz you shiver when i quiz ya
all about the real neccessities of life
all about the game and all about the name
g to the a to the n to the g starr
we know who we are but do you know who you are
richard pryor you go down there looking for justice thats what you
find just us
