you puny protozoa youre so minute you didnt know the
gang has been watchin but instead of just squashin you
im scoopin you up out of the muck you wallow in
like a cheif chemist other scientists are followin
plannin to examine you on a petrie dish
sticking you and frickin you just a teenie bit
im clever with science but never relyin
on false words from cowards who forever be tryin
insistin they come off i let em get some off
then come back wit drum tracks their ears could get numb off
blockbustin like makin love ill never stop thrustin
into your system so just listen
im like a neurosurgeon operatin wit a purer version
i write prescriptions of words that fit in
the thought gets prescribed as i kick it live
cause its more that a style its conceptual genius
my effect on the scene is to project that i mean this
you deadbeat wait until you see my next feat
i get respect for the rep when i speak

im rushin you like a defensive end as i recommend
that you comprehend i could stomp you in
a battle contest or war what will occur
will be the forfeiture of your immature
insecure for sure meek weak visions of grandeur
to rudely awaken you and thenll be breakin you
taxin without askin and trackin and snakin you
makin you succumb to the drums of gangstarr
by far we are truly gifted ones son
but if you were to speculate or estimate us losin
youll be dyin tryin to face the fate of your delusions
cause miscalculation is all youre statin
so im chumpin puntin punks just like footballs
cause i wanna put yall back in the messhall
to clean up the slop and stop all the bullcrap
your raps crazy wack so dont try to pull that
youre lackin the vernacular im slappin ya and cappin ya
and closin your jaw cause you cant mess with gangstarr

bon voyage sayonara arrivederci
your ass gets busted doodoo mustard you tried to work me
you irked me - because you copy and falsify
and i dont care how many step up cause you all can try
to wish and fish for a style heres a fishin rod
these rhymes are hittin hard constantly im gettin large
inevitably i readily kick a slew
of lyrics so deep so dont sleep but just peep me
puttin methods on records and spinning for each millisecond
33 rpms displays the art of men
and as my rhymin builds you see my time its chill
and then i look upon weak ones
im teachin each one so they become redone
essays are relayed to twist you up like french braids
or tied up like corn braids cause i got a strong way
force like police raids to never be delayed
i once was the least paid but i made the grade
cause this aint a slave sale and i aint the same stale
rapper no im not a phony microphonist wit no blaster
no type of real appeal or real - talent
and it makes me violent man
to see all of these peewee bee mc wannabees
makin gs for some dumb companies
and lots of money but no idea what is rap and what is dope
so check out what the guru wrote
cause i will prevail give you tales as i unveil
have enough braincells so i can stay paid well
now im in the drivers seat and rockin the liver beats
bouncin and boomin and blastin you to the next seat
shiek and unique with lots of kick like a cleat
