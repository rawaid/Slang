mcs be fakin so now they get taken

chorus

fake mcs they always act hard
but wont walk the street without their bodyguard
i hate fake mcs they always act hard
but wont walk the street without their bodyguard

verse one

mcs i lay out like stiffs in the morgue
praise the lord youre in awe when im gripping my mic cord
rhymes i rip with swift execution
one verse could coerce your girl to prostitution
the guru is now the brother that you fear and
beware when im making hits with premier and
rolling to a spot near you lyrics tear through
chrome to your dome you better watch your rear view
niggas been held back too long were coming up
in the streets we roll alone so watch me running up
im summing up a mad posse of warriors
night crusaders able to break down barriers
and bringing faces of death putting mcs to rest
until theres no fake chumps left
run step yeah bounce nigga bounce
my rhymes a cargo when yours is just a quarter ounce 

chorus 4x

verse two

gangstarr boy and thats beyond your comprehension
mad brothers in every city you can feel the tension
to stop the killing wack mcs must die
who am i  im the substance thatll make your third eye cry
too potent too high in intelligence quotient
when i unleash my speech ill have you punk rappers open
i wont expose your names and your identities
you know youre phoney get the fuck from in front of me
hardcore fans are fed up from your folklore
lines strip you raw and infect you like cold sores
and i hope youre not the one that im after
since the days of adidas ive been a true master

chorus 4x

verse three

ive been around punk but yo i still feel young
a few of my crew members like to pack guns
im high strung but dont mistake me when i smile
i murder an entire rap chart with my freestyle
after the killing just like casper; im ghost
fakes thought i was friendly at their wakes i was host
toast without a gun youd be done
throw up your hands bitch and now you know you stand to lose one
choose one metaphor and then choose another
wax that ass like a bully have you calling your big brother
although im five foot eight they call me sergeant
got more hoes in my dick than you can fit in the garden
at madison square i shot a fair one
so many niggaz knew me that the kid wouldnt dare run
mcs pay cash to ensure their safety
they know they cant take me; the g-a-n-g you crazy
i be on them like a message from god
knowledge of self while fake mcs play hard

chorus 4x

outro 2x

fake mcs they always act hard
im not a sucker so i dont need a bodyguard
