get on it --&gt; dj premier cuts n scratchs lovely

guru
one two checka get down and dirty
and my sounds are worthy of respect
so ima flex my text just like a major takeover
chumps pass the mic over
growin more and more nervous when i serve this ass whoopin
comin straight out of brooklyn baldhead from the old school
born to rule with more class than billy dee
to a pussy emcee you know a wuss emcee
im like his worst nightmare when im on my killin spree
pick the vic who will it be
guru *sings*
your vote may hold the key
its up to you tell us true
wholl be herb of the day
guru
and your fake you break when suckers choose they lose
im like lethal to you and your people
its like an outrage when punks step on stage
with the weak show weak flow and still make dough
so ima take dough from em and then stum em
teach em how to really get biz like this
me and my gangs gonna swarm brainstorm

get on it --&gt; dj premier flips it again

guru
it takes at least two to tango so you can get strangled
from any angle as i get buck on ducks
all the sexy girlies wanna push up close to
the man with the most who dont flaunt his ego
some motherfuckers aint as gifted
not everyone can move the crowd and uplift it
im swift with the shit like a bullets trajectory
so dont stand next to me
its like a warm sensation when my shells hit
you were wrong you know what you did so you fell quick
to the pavement no signs of body movement
see i knew it yo i had to do it
and its cool to duel but dont slip up fool
cause ima leave you dead and stinkin like a sesspool
and all the chicks know whats goin on
cause baby there aint no sunshine when im gone
and you can beg for me to stay and parlay
but sorry i gots to go got bills to pay
see by nature im godly
when i touch the mic its never too hard for me
to let out a mastermind of mad clout
huh me and my gangs gonna swarm brainstorm

get on it --&gt; dj premier displays turntablism skills

guru
im gonna get ya
you might be bigger than me so ima wet ya
come into your house to douse it with the
malatov cocktail i wont fail
burn out your eyeballs and leave a note in braille
so what the fuck you gonna do
yea i know i used to act relaxed but now im cuckoo
come into my darkest deepest thoughts
we fought i won and now youre caught and bein tortured
water pellets dripped upon your forehead
but you cant move because youre tied up
your times up
