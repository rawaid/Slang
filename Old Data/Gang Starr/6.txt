guru
that makes me know that we we we were doin
we had the right idea in the beginning
and and we just need to maintain our focus and elevate
we what we do we update our formulas
we have certain formulas but we update em oh right
with the times and everything yknow
and and so yknow
the rhyme style is elevated
the style of beats is elevated
but its still guru and premier
and its always a message involved

the real hip-hop
mcing and djing from your own mind ya know
i i guess right now we should start the show

[guru]
whos the suspicious character strapped with the sounds profound
similar to rounds spit by derringers
youre in the terrordome like my man chuck d said
its time to dethrone you clones and all you knuckleheads
cause mcs have used up extended warranties
while real mcs and djs are a minority
but right about now i use my authority
cause im like the wizard and you look lost like dorothy
the horror be when i return for my real people
words that split wigs hittin like some double desert eagles
sportin caps pulled low and baggy slacks
subtractin all the rappers who lack over premiers tracks
severe facts have brought this rap game to near collapse
so as i have in the past i whup ass
droppin lyrics that be hotter than sex and candlewax
and one-dimensional mcs cant handle that
while the worlds revolvin on its axis
i come with mad love and plus the illest warlike tactics
the wilderness is filled with this; so many people
searching for false lift im here with the skills youve missed
the rejected stone is now the cornerstone
sort of like the master builder when i make my way home
you know my steez

[method man] you know my steez
let em know do your thing yall keep it live
[flavor flav] to the beat yall

the beat is sinister primo makes you relax
im like the minister when i be lacin the wax
i be bringin salvation through the way that i rap
and you know and i know im nice like that
work through worldly problems i got the healing power
when the mics within my reach im feelin more power
stealing at least three minutes of every rap radio hour
its often easier for one to give advice
than it is for a person to run ones own life
thats why i cant be caught up in all the hype
i keep my soul tight and let these lines takes flight
the apparatus gets blessed and suckers get put to rest
no more of the unpure i got the cure for this mess
the wackness is spreadin like the plague
mcs lucked up and got paid but still cant make the fuckin grade
how many times are wannabes gonna lie
yo they must wanna fry they cant touch the knowledge i personify
i travel through the darkness carrying my torch
the illest soldier when im holding down the fort
[method man] you know my steez
you know my steez

let em know do your thing yall keep it live
[method man] you know my steez
[repeat x4 with very last line modified as follows]
the mic

on the microphone you know that im one of the best yet
some punks aint paid all of their debts yet
tryin to be fly ridin high on the jet-set
with juvenile rhymes makin fake-ass death threats
big deal like en vogue heres something you can feel
styles more tangible and image more real
for some time now ive held the scrolls and manuscripts
when its time to go all out you be like damn he flipped
now im sick fed up with the bullshit
got the lyrical full clip giving you a verbal asswhip
dont trip its the gifted prolific one
known as bald head slick -- why is the press all on my di-dick
my style be wilder than a kamikaze pilot
dont try it im about to start more than a friggin riot
styles unsurpassable and nuccas thats suckas yo
them motherfuckers are harrassable
for i be speaking from my parables and carry you beyond
the mics either a magic wand
or it gets tragic like the havoc of a nuclear bomb
then i grab your palm no pulse youre gone
and if you thought wed lose our niche in this rap shit you way wrong
i stay up i stay on shine bright like neon
your songs pathetic synthetic like rayon
fat beats they play on want dope rhymes put me on
word is bond you know my stee
