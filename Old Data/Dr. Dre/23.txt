time bomb
now in my younger days i used to sport a rag
backpack full of cans plus a four-four mag
gd from the feet up
blued up from the sewers how i grew up
locn smokin and drinkin til we threw up til we threw up
at leimert park taggin hittin fools up
ditchin my class just to fuck yo school up
you dont wanna blast nigga tuck yo tool up
but dont sleep yall niggaz quick to shoot you
now theres another motherfucker with no future
but time bomb much smoother when i manuever dope like cuba
got em jumpin {*king t starts speakin indecipherable*}

king t
im comin straight outta compton with a loose cannon
smoke big green call it bruce banner
watch your manners at last another blast from the top notch
from way back with the pop rocks i pop lock witcha
picture this dr dre twistin wit tha liks
and hittman bought a fix
dont trip its a time bomb in this bitch
here it tick tick tick tick {*boom*}
wait a minute its on i tell it like a true mackadelic
weed and cocaine sold seperate check it
from sundown to sunup -- clown done run up
the aftermathll be two in your gut nigga what

chorus knoc-turnal kokane

we roll deep smoke on weed drink and back heat
requirements for survival each day -- in la
it dont stop we still mash in hot pursuit from the cops
analyze why we act this way -- in la

hittman
gimme that mic fool its a west coast jack move
they call me hitt - cause i spit like gats do

bust caps for my max crew at fairfax
who used to wear air max shoes thats true
but i grew up where niggaz jack you harass you
blast you for that set you claim where you from
mash on you for your turkish chain ck bk
blued up or flame i ran wit a gang
i helped niggaz get jacked for they dana danes
my pants hang below my waistline
i look humble wanna rumble yeah yeah
i bang though like vince carter from the baseline
dont waste my time
fuck a scrap in killa cali aks and 9s
one-times sunshines and fine-ass bitches
hawaiian thai drive-by six-fos on switches

xzibit
i was raised in the hood called what-the-dif
where the brothers in the hood refused to go hollywood
slugs for the fuck of it
anybody hatin on us can suck a dick
if i catch you touchin mine you catch a flatline dead on the floor
better than yours drivin away gettin head from a whore
its avirex-to-the-z
fuckin with me might get you banned from tv
cassette and cd its all mine the whole nine the right time
multiply we dont die the streets dont lie
what so neither do i im bad for your health
like puttin a pistol up to your face and blastin yourself

defari
five in the mornin burglars at my do
glock forty-five in my dresser drawer
let em come in blaow he see the thunder roll
roll with niggaz who by fifths by the fo
and bruise by the case
slap you in the face with the bass dr dre laced
likwit kings wit sedans and gold rings
haters fold the style but cant find no openings

chorus

outro
