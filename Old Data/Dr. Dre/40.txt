album the chronic

intro bushwick bill
yes it is i says me
&amp; although agree are more than 3 cause theyre we
*laughter*
yes yo im in the house now for sure
because i wanna talk about the hearts of men
who knows what evil lurks within them
but lets take a travel down the blindside
&amp; see what we find on this
path
called

verse 1 kurupt
stranded on death row so duck when i swing my shit
i get rugged like rawhead rex with fat tracks that fits
the gangsta type what i recites kinda lethal
niggas know the flow that i kick theres no equal
im murderin niggas yo &amp; maybe because of the tone
i kicks when i grip the mic &amp; kick shit
niggas cant fuck with
so remember i go hardcore &amp; slam
nuff respect like a sensei ba-bash like van damme
so any nigga that claim they bossin
what dont you bring your ass on over to crenshaw &amp; slauson
take a walk through the hood when we up to no good
slangin them things like a real og should
im stackin &amp; mackin &amp; packin a 10 so
when your slippin i slip the clip in
but aint no set trippin
cause its death row rollin like the mafia
think about whippin some ass but what the fuck stoppin ya
aint nathin but a buster
im stranded on death row for pumpin slugs in muthafuckers
now you know your outdone
feel the shotgun kurupt inmate cell block one

verse 2 rbx
no prevention from this mention of sorts
your a victim from my driveby of thoughts
no extensions all attempts are to fail
blinded by the light its time you learn braile
from the lunatic i death like arsenic
when i kick up wicked raps
dr dre will kick the scratch
with treachery my literary form will blast
&amp; totally surpass the norm
not a storm plural make it many storms
when im vexed i fly leg necks &amp; arms
in this dimension im the presenter
&amp; the inventor &amp; the tormentor
deranged like the hillside strangler
mc mangler tough like wrangler
i write a rhyme hard as concrete
step to the heat &amp; get burned like mesquite
so what you wanna do
the narrator rbx cell block 2

verse 3 rage
rage lyrical murderer
stranded on death row
&amp; now im servin a lifetime sentence
therell be no repentence
since its the life that i choose to lead
i plead guilty
on all counts let the ball bounce where it may
its just another clip into my ak
buck em down with my underground tactics
facts &amp; stacks of clips on my mattress
bed frame theres another dead pain
layin lain with the shame whos to blame
me the lady of rage
on when im comin from the d e a t h in
r o w takin no shit
so flip &amp; your bound to get dropped
its 187 on muthafuckers dont stop
handcuffed as i bust therell be no debate
its rage from cell block 8

verse 4 snoop dogg
&amp; yo steppin through the fog
&amp; creepin through the smog
its the #1 nigga from the hood doggy dogg
makin videos now i stay in hollywood
bustin raps for my snaps now they call me eastwood
dre is the doctor &amp; my homey little nigga
warren g is my hand &amp; my hands on the trigga
shootin at the hoes with the game that i got
sent to death row cause i wanted to make a grip from servin my rocks
&amp; im still servin for mines peace
to my muthafuckin homies doin time
in the pen &amp; the county jail
mobbin with your blues on mad as hell
&amp; you say yeah fuck the police
&amp; all the homies on the streets is all about peace
&amp; its drivin the cops crazy
but aint nuttin but a black thing bay-bee uhhh

like the muthafuckin peter man
its like 3 &amp; to the 2
&amp; 2 &amp; to the 1
cell block 4 peace doggy doggs done

outroÂ  bushwick bill
yo now you know the path im on
you think your strong see if you can travel on
cause only the weak will try to speak
those who are quiet will always cause riots
theres 3 types of people in the world
those who dont know what happened
those who wonder what happened
&amp; people like us from the streets that make things happen
