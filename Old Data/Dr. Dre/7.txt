things just aint the same for gangsters
times is changin young niggaz is agin
becomin ogs in the game and changin
to make way for these new names and faces but
the strangest things can happen from rappin
when niggaz get wrapped up in image and actin
niggaz get capped up and wrapped in plastic
and zipped up in bags when it happens thats it
ive seen em come ive watched em go
watched em rise witnessed it and watched them blow
watched em all blossom and watched em grow
watched the lawsuits when they lost the dough
best friends and money i lost them both
went and visisted niggaz in the hospital
its all the same shit all across the globe
i just sit back and watch the show the watcher

everywhere that i go
aint the same as befo the watcher
people i used to know
just dont know me no mo the watcher
but everywhere that i go
i got people i know the watcher
who got people they know
so i suggest you lay low the watcher

i moved out of the hood for good - you blame me
niggaz aim angry at niggaz they cant be
but niggaz cant hit niggaz they cant see
im out of sight now im out of they dang reach
how would you feel if niggaz wanted you killed
youd probably move to a new house on a new hill
and choose a new spot if niggaz wanted you shot
i aint a thug - how much tupac in you you got
i aint no bitch neither
its either my life or yo life and i aint leavin - i like breathin
cause nigga we can go round for round
clip for clip shit fopound for pound
nigga if you really wanna take it there we can
just remember that you fuckin with a family man
i got a lot more to lose than you remember that
when you wanna come and fill these shoes the watcher

everywhere that i go
aint the same as befo the watcher
people i used to know
just dont know me no mo the watcher
but everywhere that i go
i got people i know the watcher
who got people they know
so i suggest you lay low the watcher

things just aint the same for gangstas
cops is anxious to put niggaz in handcuffs
they wanna hang us see us dead or enslave us
keep us trapped in the same place we raised in
then they wonder why we act so outrageous
run around stressed out and pull out gauges
cause everytime you let the animal out cages
its dangerous to people who look like strangers
but now we got a new era of gangsters
hustlers and youngsters livin amongst us
lookin at us now callin us bustaz
cant help but reminisce back when it was us
nigga we started this gangsta shit
and this the motherfuckin thanks i get
its funny how time flies
im just havin fun just watchin it fly by the watcher

everywhere that i go
aint the same as befo the watcher
people i used to know
just dont know me no mo the watcher
but everywhere that i go
i got people i know the watcher
who got people they know
so i suggest you lay low the watcher

the watcher
the watcher
the watcher
