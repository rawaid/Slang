dr dre
yall know me still the same ol g but i been low-key
hated on by most these niggas with no cheese no deals and no gs
no wheels and no keys no boats no snowmobiles and no skis
mad at me cause i can finally afford to provide my family with groceries

got a crib with a studio and its all full o tracks to add to the wall full o plaques 
hangin up in the office in back of my house like trophies
did yall think ima let my dough freeze ho please
you better bow down on both knees who you think taught you to smoke trees

who you think brought you the oldies eazy-es ice cubes and docs
the snoop d-o-double-gs and the group that said motherfuck tha police
gave you a tape full dope beats to bump when you stroll through in your hood
and when your albums sales wasnt doin too good whos the doctor they told you to go see

yall better listen up closely all you niggas that said that id turned pop
or the firm flopped yall are the reason that dre aint been gettin no sleep
so fuck yall all o yall if yall dont like me blow me
yall gon keep fuckin around wit me and turn me back to the old me

and motherfuckers act like they forgot about dre

so what do you say to somebody you hate what
or anyone tryna bring trouble your way
wanna resolve things in a bloodier way yup
just study a tape of nwa

one day i was walkin by with a walkman on when i caught a guy 
give me an awkward eye what you lookin at strangled him up in the parkin lot with his karl kanis
i dont give a fuck if its dark or not im harder than me tryna park a dodge
when im drunk as fuck right next to a humongous truck in a two car garage

hoppin out with two broken legs tryna walk it off fuck you too bitch call the cops
im a kill you and them loud-ass motherfuckin barkin dogs
and when the cops came through me and dre stood next to a burnt down house
with a can full of gas and a hand full of matches and still werent found out right here

so from here on out its the chronic 2 startin today and tomorrows anew
and im still loco enough to choke you to death with a charleston chew chikka-chikka-chikka

slim shady hotter than a set o twin babies
in a mercedes benz with the windows up when the temp goes up to the mid-eighties
callin men ladies sorry doc but i been crazy
theres no way that you can save me its ok go with him hailey dada

but now that i gots lil company everybody wanna come to me like it was some disease
but you wont get a crumb from me cause im from the streets of c—c—compton compton

i told em all all them lil gangsters who you think help mold em all
now you wanna run around talkin bout guns like i aint got none what you think i sold em all
cause i stay well off now all i get is hate mail all day sayin dre fell off
what cause i been in the lab with a pen an a pad tryna get this damn label off

i aint havin that this is the millennium of aftermath and aint gon be nothin after that
so gimme one more platinum plaque and fuck rap you can have it back
so wheres all the mad rappers at its like a jungle in this habitat
but all you savage cats know that i was strapped with gats when you were cuddlin a cabbage patch
