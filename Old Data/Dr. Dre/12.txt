verse one dr dre
everyday its the same thang la aint changed
niggaz still playa hatin but dre aint changed
im just a lot smarter now
cause these niggaz is bangin ten times harder now
niggaz ringin they ass up in the wrong part of town
better turn they car around
rollin the window down eminem hey can we talk it out
hitt nah get the fuck out
johnny got a shotgun
and he aint even strong enough to cock one
fuck tryin to job hunt
niggaz got aks niggaz is way crazier
than dre was back in his nwa days
niggaz spray strays and shoot without lookin
niggaz walk by and blast without leavin a footprint
i think the attitudes are twice as worst
it takes half the time to get your life reversed
always tryin to play rambo with they ammo
make a nigga wanna stay in family mode
bang bang bang bang

chorus

second verse knoc-turnal
late nights is full of led that whistles as it goes by
murder arrives anytime
bullets take flight when the fo-five ignites
some hearts skip a beat some get blew out and every light
put you in the site of youngsters with automatics
bustin on shit to lay everything down even tourists and non-affiliates
these days gun play is official with green lights on every block
know the sign tells you too its not best to stop
on every corner cali niggaz are dumpin
youll be shakin your soul loose from the box at the coroners
makin death not so foreign to ya
niggaz got rugers and m-14s with enough
ammo to leave an armored truck swiss cheese
ive learned to stay away from house parties
ive seen too many go and end up absent without leavin
aint no warm welcomings my eyes have witnessed the bend in on
nights that dont sleep and fireworks until dawn

chorus

third verse hittman
now tell me - what the fuck is this man
niggaz doin brothers in worse than the klan
cant even stand in front of your buildin and chill
without yieldin twelve-year-old children that kill
blood spillin thugs be illin unnecessary slugs
fillin the sky usually drillin the one
that wasnt willin to die yes sir in the killing field
i got my life preserver
and ill do my time for murder these niggaz got the nerve to
question me - bout the colors that i got on
now see that red dot on your knot
bout to get your whole crew shot on
a soldier of fortune im the wrong nigga to plot on
took him out on the spot before he even got on
my hitlist -- peep this
i cock back you bow down
bust round bloody the ground retaliation sounds like this

everywhere i go all i ever seem to hear is
bang bang bang bang
no matter where i go all i ever seem to see is
bang bang bang bang
everywhere i go all i ever seem to hear is
bang bang bang bang
no matter where i go all i ever seem to see is
bang bang bang bang
everywhere i go all i ever seem to hear is
bang bang bang bang
no matter where i go all i ever seem to see is
bang bang bang bang
everywhere i go all i ever seem to hear is
bang bang bang bang
no matter where i go all i ever seem to see is
bang bang bang bang
