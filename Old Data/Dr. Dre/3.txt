they say raps changed they want to know how i feel about it

[2nd verse dr dre]
since the last time you heard from me i lost some friends
well hell me &amp; snoop we dippin again
kept my ear to the streets signed eminem
hes triple platinum doin 50 a week
still i stay close to the heat
&amp; even when i was close to defeat i rose to my feet
my lifes like a soundtrack i wrote to the beat
treat rap like cali weed i smoke til i sleep
wake up in the am compose a beat
i bring the fire til your soakin in your seat
its not a fluke its been tried im the truth
since turn out the lights from the world class wreckin cru
im still at it after-mathematics
in the home of drive-bys &amp; akmatics
swap meets sticky green &amp; bad traffic
i dip through then i get skin dre

chorus - twice
[snoop dogg]
im representin for them gangstas all across the world
still hittin them corners in them low-lows girl

[dr dre]

[snoop dogg]
hittin them corners in them low-lows girl

[snoop dogg]

[dr dre]
dr dre be the name still runnin the game
