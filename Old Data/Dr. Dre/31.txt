verse 1 snoop dogg
wake up jumped out my bed
hung in a 2 man cell wit my homey lil 1/2 dead
murder was the case that they gave me
dear god i wonder can you save me
im only 18 so im a young buck
its a ride if i dont scrap im gettin stuck
but thats the life of a g i guess
eses way deep shanked 2 in they chest
bests run cause brothers is droppin quicker
ugn too late damn down goes another nigga
bouncin off the walls throwin them dogs
gettin a rep as a young hog
it aint nuttin like the street life
betta be strapped wit yo clip cause aint no fist fight
so i guess i gots to handle mine
since i did the crime i gots to do my time

them say me grow up to be nuttin
look at me now what do you see
i am what i am its only me

lil ghetto boy
playin in the ghetto streets
whatcha gonna do when you grow up
&amp; have to face responsibility

verse 2 dr dre
now im trollin the dove sittin on swoll
27 years old off on parole stroll
im back up on my feet wit my mind on the money
that im makin as soon as i touch the street
things done changed on this side
remember they used to thump but now they blast right
but it aint no thing to me
cause now im what they call a locd assed og
the little homies from the hood wit grip
are the ones i get wit cause im down respect trip
nigga im bigger than you so whatcha wanna do
didnt know we had a 22
straight sittin behind his back
im grab his pockets &amp; then i heard 6 caps
i fell to the ground wit blood on my hands
i didnt understand
how a nigga so young could bust a cap
i use to be the same way back
i guess thats what i get for what
for tryin to jack them little homies for they bread

me learn many things of
what me see from the streets
the outcome of what i come to be

lil ghetto boy
playin in the ghetto streets
whatcha gonna do when you grow up
&amp; have to face responsibility

verse 3 snoop dogg
something for the real ogs to get wit
some facts made our made now you wanna run &amp; play
like every single day really doe
you know me im the smooth macadamien gamin them for my homey
no need to be uncalm if you pack right
&amp; learnin just enough to keep your sack right
late nights i wonder what they gettin fo
early morning on the corners what they hittin fo
7 young gs but they serve down
in a jeep ride east side what they swerve now
not thinkin about whats really goin on
got crept on stepped on now they gone
i spent 4 years in the county wit nuttin but convicts around me
but now im back at the pound
&amp; we expose ways for the youth to survive
some think its wrong but we tend to think its right
so make all them ends you can make
cause when your broke you break check it out
so aint no need for your mama to trip
cause yous a hustlin ass youngsta clocking your grip

&amp; now me life as you can see
still an og for life
&amp; always remain to be

lil ghetto boy
playin in the ghetto streets
whatcha gonna do when you grow up
&amp; have to face responsibility
