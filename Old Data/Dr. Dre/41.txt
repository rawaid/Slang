this one is for my brother tyree rip
a message to god

[dr dre]
since you finishin him early what possessed you to start him
we made a vow later well regret til death do us part
lord i thought we was made for each other
you shouldnt connect those made to be taken away from each other
now what im supposed to do im only half the man that i was
ill never last cause my better half is up there wit you
you knew what you was doin when you made us; so with all due respect
you couldve forgave him you didnt have to take him
he can take the game with him cause he defines the word
the one who puts the g in it who you think put me in it
im feelin like my whole world is blinded
wonderin why im cryin pourin out my heart pourin out liquor behind it
we fought like brothers somethin we never should do
we couldve used time spent arguin tellin the truth
he had talent too i had plans on watchin him blow
dont know what hurts more seein him leave or watchin him go

youse a soldier your probably packin heat up there
met up with homies from the street &amp; got deep up there
if you only knew the way i felt before they ruined the crew
i thought i learned from eazy now im goin through it wit you
we lost a thug a son &amp; a father
i spoke to your son the other day &amp; told him uncle dre got him
the lord must be accidentally pullin your file
cause im still paging you 911 straight in denial
prayin you get it but no man can choose the card he was dealt
you either quit or you gon play em like you get it
i done been through all emotions from in shock to keepin a poker face to straight breakin down &amp; showin all emotions
from anxious to believe in real gs dont cry
if thats the truth then im realizin i aint no gangsta
its just not me but you know im a always ride wit you
i miss you sometimes i wish i just died wit you
