someone right now is leaving their apartment
looking down at the street and wondering where their car went
someone in the car sitting at a signal
in front of a restaurant staring through the window

at someone right now with their finger in their teeth
who could use a little floss right across the street
theres somebody on the curb who really needs a jacket
but spent half the rent at a bar getting plastered

now hes gotta walk fourteen blocks
just to work at a shop where hes about to get fired
someone right now is looking pretty tired
staring at a laptop trying to get inspired

as somebody living right across the street
just wrote the best thing that shes written all week
but her best friends coughing up blood in the sink
he cant even think what happened feeling so confused
and he knows it looks bad but theres nothing he can do
i wonder what its like to be right there in his shoes but

yo im just taking it in
out the window of a hotel bedroom again
tomorrow ill be gone i dont know when ill be back
but in this world everything can change just like that like that

yo somebody right now is dropping his vote
inside a box and trying to not get shot in his throat
for the act of freedom right now somebodys stuck in iraq
hoping that he gets shipped back breathing

in a war but hes not really sure the reasons
so we show our support when the press mislead him
though we mourn remain proud salute the troops
get some i know you boys got some work to do

meanwhile right now someones 25-to-life-ing
standing on a corner with their thumb up hitchhiking
scratching off a lotto ticket hoping for a real winner
sneaking through the border just to work and eat a real dinner

right now someone wishes they were you and i
instead of second-guessing fatal thoughts of quiet suicide
but right now im staring at the window at a frame
with holes in his arm and holes in his jeans
he pulled out a cigarette and sparked the light 
and walked right around the corner just outta my sight but

yo im just taking it in
from the second story hotel window again
the tvs on and my bags are packed
but in this world everything can change just like that like that

yo im just taking it in
from the second story hotel window again
the tvs on and my bags are packed
but in this world everything can change just like that like that

yeah right now somebodys sittin in the darkness
tryin to figure how to put some heat in their apartment
but they got a little mattress little carpet
and they appreciate it cause some people on a park bench

you see em when you rushing to get to the office
wife robbed blind when she coming from the market
right now somebody comin out the pocket
tryin to dump that rock they runnin round the block with

the same time the cops is raising the glock with aim
to fill your legs and your back with some hot shit
right now somebodys struggling to stop this man
whos kicking and punching and cussing at the doctors

down the hall a child takin its first breath
the doctors aint even passed him to the nurse yet yo
i wonder if he understands what its worth yet
life the time spent while we here on the earth yet

the answers to the questions we all seek
can be found it depend on how free yall think
right now its somebody who aint eat all week
that would kill for the shit you throw away in the street

i guess ones mans trash is the next mans treasure
one mans pain is the next mans pleasure
one say infinity the next say forever
right now everybody got to get it together man

im just taking it in
in another strange hotel lobby again
put my luggage on my back i dont know where im at
im in a world where it all changes just like that like that

yeah im just taking it in
out the window of a hotel bedroom again
tomorrow ill be gone i dont know when ill be back
but in this world everything can change just like that like that yeah
