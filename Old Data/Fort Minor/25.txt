ladies and gentlemen
i would like to welcome you to a fort minor event
the countdown has begun
the rising tied is almost here
but for now

green lantern
come on mike

mike
yo lets get it going in front of every man anybody
you gotta be ready its heavy when we get it rowdy
we wont apologize or even think of saying sorry
this is the way we rock steady over everybody
you probably shocked probably ready to stop this already
you probably cant hang with the way we attack it so steady
we let it rock the room and bang the benz shake the chevy
til everybody feels it in the chest say it with me

chorus
this is the time so just follow me
its already heated to 100 degrees so
get up get up get up get up
get up get up get up get up

wait a second you know the program this is not a slow jam
this is not a love song unless you love tearing shit down
take a look around youre not running this
the bluff in your nothing will hit you like a ton of bricks
hit you together with pressure you can never stand
the softest leather just a featherweight never man
were not your competitors setting you straight
you never compete forget it its already too late go

chorus

yo if you dont see im a make you see this
if you dont roll im a make you believe it
get up get up get up get up
get up get up get up get up

shh give me a second im collecting my thoughts
and setting plots all right yall ready or not
ive listened and watched and waited for an opening spot
and now that i got it nobody can pay me to stop
im sick of that same thing ive been forced to hear
over and over again let me make this clear
if anybody pretends that were nothing to fear
i solemnly swear its over you can tell em were here

chorus
yo if you dont see im a make you see this
if you dont roll im a make you believe it
get up get up get up get up
get up get up get up get up
