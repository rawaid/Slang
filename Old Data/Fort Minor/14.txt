i had a friend named victor
the two of us used to hang every single day
and it seemed like overnight
that his whole life just changed
i know when his mom and dad broke up
it didnt make sense
but i know that his dad was a drunk
and he gambled away the rent

pretty soon vic was seeing red
pissed off but instead
hed drink every night til he passed out
and then hed do it all again
the whole time
smiling on the outside to cover the pain
but on the inside
all he was trying to do was get away

dying to get away
let the pain of yesterday
go slipping through the cracks

yo funny how things change color
then fade to another shade
when you had it made it was all good
but now look just another day
it was so fresh it was so clean
now its all gone one two three
lights out which way to turn
cant get a grip all alone in a big white house

every day gets worse
and you just curse til your head bursts
and it hurts so bad she left now you suffer
shouldve thought of that one first
no family no kids
cant accept what you did
now you wanna run away but you cant
cause the past comes back again

slippin through the cracks sip a little jack
go to bed half dead what about rent
why does every cent gotta be a bet
whens it gonna end
oh my god we dont got a penny left
my moms gotta find a way to get a job
outta debt outta dodge out of breath
out of this big problem

my pops wanna get away from the pain
in a better place in his brain
but the medication he takes
makes him wasted
so sick if hes gonna think
the good lord would come take him
im shaking him wake up
you son of a bitch

hes dying to get away
let the pain of yesterday
go slipping through the cracks
hiding himself away
watching all the memories fade
away from red to black

hes dying to get away
let the pain of yesterday
go slipping through the cracks
hiding himself away
watching all the memories fade
away from red to black

slipping through the cracks
slipping through the cracks
slipping through the cracks
