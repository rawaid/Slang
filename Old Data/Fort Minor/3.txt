my father came from japan in 1905
he was 15 when he immigrated from japan
he he he worked until he was able to buy this patch
and build a store

let me tell you the story in the form of a dream
i dont know why i have to tell it but i know what it means
close your eyes just picture the scene
as i paint it for you it was world war ii
when this man named kenji woke up
ken was not a soldier
he was just a man with a family who owned a store in la

that day he crawled out of bed like he always did
bacon and eggs with wife and kids
he lived on the second floor of a little store he ran
he moved to la from japan
they called him immigrant
in japanese hed say he was called issei
that meant first generation in the united states

when everyone was afraid of the germans afraid of the japs
but most of all afraid of a homeland attack
and that morning when ken went out on the doormat
his world went black cause
right there front page news three weeks before 1942
pearl harbours been bombed and the japs are comin

pictures of soldiers dyin and runnin
ken knew what it would lead to
just like he guessed the president said
the evil japanese in our home country will be locked away
they gave ken a couple of days
to get his whole life packed in two bags
just two bags couldnt even pack his clothes

some folks didnt even have a suitcase to pack anything in
so two trash bags was all they gave them
and when the kids asked mom where are we goin
nobody even knew what to say to them
ken didnt wanna lie he said the us is lookin for spies
so we have to live in a place called manzanar
where a lot of japanese people are

stop it dont look at the gunmen
you dont wanna get the soldiers wonderin
if you gonna run or not
cause if you run then you might get shot
other than that try not to think about it
try not to worry bout it bein so crowded
someday well get out someday someday

as soon as war broke out
the fbi came and they just come to the house and
you have to come
all the japanese have to go
they took mr lee
people didnt understand
why did they have to take him
because hes an innocent laborer

so now theyre in a town with soldiers surroundin them
every day every night look down at them
from watch towers up on the wall
ken couldnt really hate them at all
they were just doin their job and
he wasnt gonna make any problems

he had a little garden with vegetables and fruits that
he gave to the troops in a basket his wife made
but in the back of his mind he wanted his families life saved
prisoners of war in their own damn country what for

time passed in the prison town
he wanted if hed live it down if and when they were free
the only way out was joinin the army
and supposedly some men went out for the army signed on
and ended up flyin to japan with a bomb
that 15 kiloton blast put an end to the war pretty fast
two cities were blown to bits the end of the war came quick

ken got out big hopes of a normal life
wwith his kids and his wife but
when they got back to their home
what they saw made them feel so alone
these people had trashed every room
smashed in the windows and bashed in the doors
written on the walls and the floor
japs not welcome anymore

and kenji dropped both of his bags at his sides and just stood outside
he looked at his wife without words to say
she looked back at him wiped the tears away
and said someday well be okay someday

now the names have been changed but the storys true
my family was locked up back in 42
my family was there it was dark and damp
and they called it an internment camp

when we first got back from camp uhh
it was pretty pretty bad

i i remember my husband said
are we gonna stay til last
then my husband died before they close the camp
