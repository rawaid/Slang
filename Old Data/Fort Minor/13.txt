whered you go
i miss you so
seems like its been forever
that youve been gone

she said some days i feel like shit
some days i wanna quit and just be normal for a bit
i dont understand why you have to always be gone
i get along but the trips always feel so long

and i find myself trying to stay by the phone
cause your voice always helps me to not feel so alone
but i feel like an idiot workin my day around the call
but when i pick up i dont have much to say

so i want you to know its a little fucked up
that im stuck here waitin at times debatin
tellin you that ive had it with you and your career
me and the rest of the family here singing whered you go

whered you go
i miss you so
seems like its been forever
that youve been gone

whered you go
i miss you so
seems like its been forever
that youve been gone
please come back home

come back home you know the place where you used to live
used to barbecue up burgers and ribs
used to have a little party every halloween with candy by the pile
but now you only stop by every once and a while

shit i find myself just fillin my time
with anything to keep the thought of you from my mind
im doin fine and im plannin to keep it that way
you can call me if you find that you have something to say

and ill tell you i want you to know its a little fucked up
that im stuck here waitin at times debatin
tellin you that ive had it with you and your career
me and the rest of the family here singing whered you go

whered you go
i miss you so
seems like its been forever
that youve been gone

whered you go
i miss you so
seems like its been forever
that youve been gone
please come back home

i want you to know its a little fucked up
that im stuck here waitin no longer debatin
tired of sittin and hatin and makin these excuses
for why youre not around and feeling so useless

it seems one thing has been true all along
you dont really know what you got til its gone
i guess ive had it with you and your career
when you come back i wont be here and you can sing it

whered you go
i miss you so
seems like its been forever
that youve been gone

whered you go
i miss you so
seems like its been forever
that youve been gone
please come back home

please come back home
please come back home
please come back home
please come back home
