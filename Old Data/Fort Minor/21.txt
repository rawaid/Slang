i guess that this is where weve come to
if you dont want to then you dont have to believe me
but i wont be there when you go down
just so you know now youre on your own now believe me

yo i dont wanna be the one to blame
you like fun and games keep playin em im just sayin
think back then we was like one and the same
on the right track but i was on the wrong train

its like that now you gotta face the pain
and the devils got a fresh new place to play
in your brain like a maze you can never escape
the rain every damn days the same shade of grey

hey i used to have a little bit of a plan
used to have a concept of where i stand
but that concept slipped right outta my hand
now i dont really even know who i am

yo what do i have to say maybe
i should do what i have to do to break free and
whatever happens to you well see
but its not gonna happen with me

i guess that this is where weve come to
if you dont want to then you dont have to believe me
but i wont be there when you go down
just so you know now youre on your own now believe me

back then i thought you were just like me
somebody who could see all the pain i see
but you proved to me unintentionally
that you would self-destruct eventually

now im thinkin like the mistake i made doesnt hurt
but its not gonna work cause its really much worse than i thought
i wished you were something you were not
and now this guilt is really all that ive got

you turned your back and walk away ashamed
all you got is a memory and pain
nothing makes sense so you stare at the ground
and hear my voice in your head when no one else is around

so what do i have to say maybe
i should do what i have to do to break free and
whatever happens to you well see
but its not gonna happen with me

i guess that this is where weve come to
if you dont want to then you dont have to believe me
but i wont be there when you go down
just so you know now youre on your own now believe me

yeah
lets go

i guess that this is where weve come to
if you dont want to then you dont have to believe me
but i wont be there when you go down
just so you know now youre on your own now believe me

im doin what i have to do
youre on your own now believe me
whatever happens to you
youre on your own now believe me

what do i have to say
youre on your own now believe me
its not gonna happen with me
youre on your own now believe me
