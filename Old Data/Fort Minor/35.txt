mike
come with me
let me walk you
through the world that i currently stay in
you can take a look around
and tell me if im mistaken
you can meet and talk to
everybody that i live with
maybe you can tell me why
everybodys so distant
is it me or maybe
when i look around daily
i dont even know the people
i can put my trust in lately
people that used to hang with
now theyre acting so different
im still the same person
why doesnt anybody listen
can somebody please just explain to me
what happened to the way
that we always said wed be
right now i dont know why
i pushed through the pain that i got through
and im losing hope

kenna
deafening voices
that frequency inside my head
that says
im going at it the hard way
im focused
everything inside out of my brain
that claims
im going at it the hard way

mike
come with me
let me walk you
through the world that i currently live in
not a thing is forgotten
not a thing is forgiven
nobody can hold their own
underneath the weight but
nobody can take the blame
for their own mistakes so
what do you do
when somebody lets you down
and you want to say something
but you cant because theyre not around
inside you think they
know the extent of the pain
but they wont even admit
that they were the one to blame
can somebody please just explain to me
what happened to the way
that we always said wed be
because right now i dont know why
i pushed through the pain that i got through
and im losing hope

deafening voices
that frequency inside my head

voices
voices

in my head
in my head

can somebody please just explain to me
what happened to the way
that we always said wed be
right now i dont know
why i pushed through
the pain that i got through
and im losing hope
give me one reason not to
