that beat is hard

this is how it goes
welcome one and all to the show
were wired up
fired up
fucking ready to go
in the back of the parking lot outside of the bar
twenty deep
twenty feet from the boulevard
black hoodies
black caps
black label in glasses
previewing the new shit before the masses
cause the first thing i need when ive got a new beat
is to see how it sounds
echoing off the street
i just take it for a spin
pop the cd in
slide it up to ten and get that rearview shaking
then play it again so theres no mistaking
san andreas the block
get this bitch earthquaking like

oh
ready for it here we go
we got the whole block rocking in stereo
were taking control
letting everybody know
and if you feel it
let me hear everybody go

youre not ready
i got plenty cuts for twenty months dropped steadily
plenty tracks to empty on your wack pedigree
im backed heavily while youre back peddling
forget the chitchat on me homie
kick back
im on that shit that can get your homie bitch-slapped
so zip your lip back
listen and watch
we got the whole block rockin off the way the beat knocks
you dont have to warn the people on the corner
they know
that if youre standing on that corner then youre getting that show
world premiering youre hearing that machine shop flow
san andreas the block
get this bitch earthquaking like

oh
ready for it here we go
we got the whole block rocking in stereo
were taking control
letting everybody know
and if you feel it
let me hear everybody go

turn the key
turn the volume up to loud
roll right
roll every window down
let the whole block know what this is about
turn it up yall
burn that system out
