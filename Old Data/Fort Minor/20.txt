you know me i used to
get caught up in everyday life
tried to make it through my day
so i could sleep at night
tried to figure out my way
through the maze of rights and wrongs
but like you used to say
nothing feels like its really worth it

forget perfect
im trying not to be worthless
since i last saw you
ive been lookin for a purpose
well i met this kid
who thought like i did
he had a weird way of lookin at it
this is what he said

slip out the back before they know you were there
and at the worst youll see nobody cares
cause you dont wanna be around when it all goes down
even heroes know when to be scared
slip out the back before they know you were there
and at the worst youll see nobody cares
cause you dont wanna be around when it all goes down
even heroes know when to be scared

now i dont remember where i met him
or remember his name
but he walked funny like he
was just too big for his frame
just over five foot
but he weighed a buck fifty
and what he said seemed so right
it stuck with me

listen its like poker
you can play your bets
but you got to know when to fold
your cards and take a rest
and know when to hold your cards
hold your breath
and hope that nobody else
is stacking the deck because

i dont need to tell you
that life isnt fair
it doesnt care
it arbitrarily cuts off your air
and like you
i want someone to say its okay
in the truest parts of our hearts
everybodys afraid

were just under appreciated
and overwhelmed
fighting so hard to hide our fear
that were scaring ourselves
you understand what im saying
cause you always did
but its different in the words
of a cowardly kid who said

slip out the back before they know you were there
and at the worst youll see nobody cares
cause you dont wanna be around when it all goes down
even heroes know when to be scared
slip out the back before they know you were there
and at the worst youll see nobody cares
cause you dont wanna be around when it all goes down
even heroes know when to be scared

and im no hero
you remember how it was you know
all i ever did was worry
feeling out of control
to the point where everything
was going end over end
im spinning around
in circles again

this is where you come in

all of this
to explain to you why
i had to separate myself
away from yesterdays life
please remember
this isnt how i hoped it would be
but i had to protect you
from me

thats why i slipped out the back before you knew i was there
i know you felt unprepared
but every single time i was around i just bring you down
and i could tell that it was time to be scared
thats why i slipped out the back before you knew i was there
and i know the way i left wasnt fair
i didnt want to be around just to bring you down
im not a hero but dont think i didnt care
