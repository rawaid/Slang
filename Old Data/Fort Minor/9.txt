yeah go ahead and uh cue the special effects

man i love this rap game mainly cause its cool
to add a little spice to the life youve been through
everyone exaggerates a tiny little bit
make that shit sound more gangster than it really is

you cant appear weak man we wanna hear street
we wanna hear you spit your thug over this here beat
dont take it as sarcastic i cant get enough
im tellin you you can call my bluff
if its not rough then i really dont need it

im not even ashamed
i got too much reality thats fillin up my brain
so sell me on that product im addicted to the game
suck it up like a cigarette light it up

its just like a cigarette its somethin that i do
once in a while but between me an you
its just like a cigarette nobodys really fooled
i dont want the truth i wanna feel fuckin cool

let me tell you something that i realized tonight
my hip hop radio is like marlboro lights
theyre both sellin stories and they sound about the same
cigarettes say theyre safe rappers claim they really bang

we dont care if its true when we lay the money down
we dont believe the words we just love the way they sound
theyre acting like were idiots theyre lyin to our face
maybe we are idiots we buy it anyway

im runnin out to get the next rappers cd
just suckin up the guns drugs and misogyny
the same way that i suck up all the stories when i breathe
that little bit of death supposedly cancer-free

and everything they says got the truth twisted up
but twisted ups what i want man i cant get enough
cause even though we know its all just a big bluff
we just light another up what we dont give a fuck

its just like a cigarette its somethin that i do
once in a while but between me an you
its just like a cigarette nobodys really fooled
i dont want the truth i wanna feel fuckin cool

its just like a cigarette its somethin that i do
over and over but between me an you
its just like a cigarette nobodys really fooled
i dont want the truth i wanna feel fuckin cool

man listen to my words listen for a while
lip service radio dont touch the dial
if youre in the car turn up the track man
give your whole neighborhood some second-hand rap

hey matter of fact listen for a while
lip service radio dont touch the dial
if youre in the car man turn up the track
and give the whole neighborhood some second-hand rap

its just like a cigarette its somethin that i do
once in a while but between me an you
its just like a cigarette nobodys really fooled
i dont want the truth i wanna feel fuckin cool

its just like a cigarette its somethin that i do
over and over but between me an you
its just like a cigarette nobodys really fooled
i dont want the truth i wanna feel fuckin cool
