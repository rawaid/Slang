you ready
lets go
yeah
for those of you that want to know what were all about
its like this yall come on

this is 10% luck
20% skill
15% concentrated power of will
5% pleasure
50% pain
and a 100% reason
to remember the name

mike
he doesnt need his name up in lights
he just wants to be heard
whether its the beat or the mike
he feels so unlike
everybody else alone
in spite of the fact
that some people still think
that they know him
but fuck them
he knows the code
its not about the salary
its all about reality
and making some noise
making the story
making sure his clique stays up
that means when he puts it down
taks picking it up
lets go

who the hell is he anyway
he never really talks much
never concerned with status
but still leaving them star struck
humbled through opportunities
given to him despite the fact
that many misjudge him
because he makes a living from writing raps
put it together himself
now the picture connects
never asking for someones help
or to get some respect
hes only focused on what he wrote
his will is beyond reach
and now when it all unfolds
the skill of an artist

its just 20% skill
80% fear
be 100% clear
because ryu is ill
who wouldve thought that
hed be the one to set the west in flames
and i heard him wrecking with
the crystal methods name of the game
came back dropped megadef
took them to church
i like bleach man
ryu had the stupidest verse
this dude is the truth
now everybody be giving him guest spots
his stocks through the roof
i heard he fucking with s dot

this is 10% luck
20% skill
15% concentrated power of will
5% pleasure
50% pain
and a 100% reason
to remember the name

they call him ryu the sick
and hes spitting fire with mike
got him out the dryer hes hot
found him in fort minor with tak
been a fucking an nihilist porcupine
hes a prick hes a cock
the type woman want to be with
and rappers hope he get shot
8 years in the making
patiently waiting to blow
now the record with
shinodas taking over the globe
hes got a partner in crime
his shit is equally dope
you wont believe the kind of shit
that comes out of this kids throat

tak
hes not your everyday on the block
he knows how to work with what hes got
making his way to the top
people think its a common owners name
people keep asking him was it given at birth
or does it stand for an acronym no
hes living proof
got him rocking the booth
hell get you buzzing quicker than a shot of vodka with juice
him and his crew are known around as one of the best
dedicated to what they doing
give a 100%

forget mike
nobody really knows how or why
he works so hard
it seems like hes never got time
because he writes every note
and he writes every line
and ive seen him at work
when that light goes on in his mind
its like a design
is written in his head every time
before he even touches a key
or speaks in a rhyme
and those mother fuckers he runs with
those kids that he signed
ridiculous without even trying
how do they do it

this is 10% luck
20% skill
15% concentrated power of will
5% pleasure
50% pain
and a 100% reason
to remember the name
