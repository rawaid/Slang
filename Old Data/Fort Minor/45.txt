you ready
lets go 

yeah
for those of you that wanna know what were all about
its like this yall come on
 

this is 10% luck 20% skill
15% concentrated power of will
5% pleasure 50% pain
and 100% reason to remember the name

mike
he doesnt need his name up in lights
he just wants to be heard whether its the beat or the mic
he feels so unlike everybody else alone
in spite of the fact that some people still think that they know him
but fuck em he knows the code
its not about the salary
its all about reality and making some noise
makin a story makin sure his clique stays up
that means when he puts it down taks pickin it up
lets go

who the hell is he anyway
he never really talks much
never concerned with status but still leaving em star-struck
humbled through opportunities given despite the fact
that many misjudge him because he makes a nickel from writing raps
put it together himself now the picture connects
never asking for someones help or to get some respect
hes only focused on what he wrote his will is beyond reach
and now it all unfolds the skill of an artist

this is just 20% skill
80% fear
be a 100% percent clear cause ryu is ill
who wouldve thought hed be the one that set the west in flames
then i heard him wreck it with the crystal method name of the game
came back dropped megadeath; took em to church
i like bleach man ryu had the stupidest verse
this dude is the truth now everybodys givin him guest spots
his stock is through the roof; i heard hes fuckin with s-dot

this is 10% luck 20% skill
15% concentrated power of will
5% pleasure 50% pain
and 100% reason to remember the name

they call him ryu hes sick
and hes spitting fire and mike
got him out the dryer; hes hot
found him in fort minor with tak
been a fuckin annihilist porcupine
hes a prick; hes a cock
the type woman want to be with and rappers hope he gets shot
eight years in the makin patiently waitin to blow
now the record with shinodas taking over the globe
hes got a partner in crime; his shit is equally dope
you wont believe the kind of shit that comes out of this kids throat tak

hes not your every day on the block
he knows how to work with what hes got
making his way to the top
he often gets a comment on his name
people keep asking him was it given at birth
or does it stand for an acronym
no hes livin proof; got him rockin the booth
hell get you buzzin quicker than a shot of vodka with juice
him and his crew are known around as one of the best
dedicated to what they doin give a 100%

forget mike
nobody really know how or why he works so hard
it seems like hes never got time
because he writes every note and he writes every line
and ive seen him at work when that light goes on in his mind
its like a design is written in his head every time
before he even touches a key or speaks in a rhyme
and those motherfuckers he runs with those kids that he signed
ridiculous without even trying how do they do it

this is 10% luck 20% skill
15% concentrated power of will
5% pleasure 50% pain
and 100% reason to remember the name

this is 10% luck 20% skill
15% concentrated power of will
5% pleasure 50% pain
and 100% reason to remember the name
