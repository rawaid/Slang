yeah these days are dark and the nights are cold
people acting like they lost their soul
and everywhere i go i see another person like me
trying to make it all feel like home feel like home

these days are dark and the nights are cold
people acting like they lost their soul
and everywhere i go i see another person like me
trying to make it all feel like home feel like home

standing on the bridge in the dark and im seeing my breath
trying to make it home without freezing to death
and my grandfathers face is stuck in my mind mind and how
seeing him tonights gonna be the last time

i shouldve brought a jacket
blowing in my hands like its really gonna stop the chill
i buy a cup of coffee with a five dollar bill
thinking layin in that box people look so still

at times like these you start thinkin
your first breath in and the clock starts tickin
im not trying to bum anyone out
not trying to be dramatic just thinking out loud

im just trying to make some sense in my mind
some defence from the cold that im feeling outside
and for a minute escape with some rhythm and rhyme 
and get away from the grey just a bit of the time

yeah kinda funny how this world can treat you
like a freak in a sideshow a carnival creature
climbing outta cans im a diamond in the sand
but you cant tell the difference on a beach full of rhinestones

my lifes like trying to swallow a pine cone
its tough when you live fast just to die slow
talk to dial tones my dreams are far fetched
it seems so i sleep underneath this park bench

i know it dont make sense
and i dont expect for you to know what its like
smoke drink piss sniffing everything in my sight
push rocks in a pipe
liftoff i keep puffin til my lips turn white

and my chest gets tight but who the fuck really cares
when youre so far left that even death looks right
all i can do is hope for the best and pray
that it gets a little better than yesterday these

these days are dark and the nights are cold
people acting like they lost their soul
and everywhere i go i see another person like me
trying to make it all feel like home feel like home

these days are dark and the nights are cold
people acting like they lost their soul
and everywhere i go i see another person like me
trying to make it all feel like home feel like home

yo pardon me i think im next to url
too many problems going on thats why i left my girl
packed my bags and i traveled with a pen and my notepad
pissed that i was broke and all the things that i dont have

but still i try to find a way to escape
from all the hate planted in my head which lead to mistakes
but now im breaking the mold see i was patient and calm
many sleep in the rain but im awake in the storm

writing my life in a short film the rise and fall
how i managed to scorch hills and climb the walls
pound pavement aimless in this cold existence
even though things are changing im going the distance

overcoming the doubt that had control for so long
and put it all behind me cause life still goes on
now im much stronger and know where i stand
while lost souls search over and over again

these days are dark and the nights are cold
people acting like they lost their soul
and everybodys trying not to cry trying to get by
and trying not to feel out of control out of control

and if you look hard enough
sometimes youll find a place
that might just remind you of home
but if it doesnt feel like home
you can do what i do
just pretend you dont feel so alone so alone

feel like home feel like home
feel like home feel like home
feel like home feel like home
feel like home feel like home

feel like home feel like home
feel like home feel like home
feel like home feel like home
feel like home feel like home
