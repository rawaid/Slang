come on talk to em

this is the story of them against us
win or lose
forcing your feet into someone elses shoes
everybodys got somethin to say
that we oughta live their way
what were doins not okay

in this world everybodys got a chip on
both sides of their neck
got no respect
wait up a sec
you ever feel like the pressures too much too take
too much weight

ladies and gentlemen
if anybody can hear me right now
please shout back

were not the only ones feelin so trapped
in a dream of somebody else in fact
they got their heads full of some overblown scheme
opportunity they missed back when they were sixteen
and all they want to do is push you to be that
and all you wanna do is scream back

gonna be somebody
for anybody tellin me i cant
gonna be someone
for anyone who told me i had no chance
gonna be somebody
im tellin you the time has come like that
gonna be someone
and maybe youll get it when im finally done

we dont sleep to dream
we sleep to build stamina
energy to do our thing get your camera
cause this ride is about to begin
sit down and buckle it in
let me say it again

in this world everybodys got a chip on
both sides of their neck
got no respect
wait up a sec
when i was young
they said the odds of makin it were slim to none

ladies and fuck it
im tired of them sayin the dream you have doesnt exist
tellin you youre worthless sayin you should quit
basically tellin you that youll never be shit

really theyre pissed cause theyll never achieve
some opportunity they missed back when they were sixteen
and all they want to do is push you to be that
and all you wanna do is scream back

uh they gone think youre crazy
mumblin to yourself
in the basement all day
uh-uh-uhin to ya self

my pops didnt dig it
was shovelin to myself
my boys used to get it
they dug it because they felt

my undertakin took me
i was makin in my stealth
for wealth of rhymes of crazy
i would chuckle to myself

then they went into
the mental rolodex
see im know em by heart
like a brain in my chest

and i took em to school
where subjects was gettin felt
books under my seat
no book layin on my desk

my teachers like mr jaco
yes
with all that knowledge
you aint tryin to go to college

be a lawyer or a doctor
get a whole lotta dollars
rather degrade women
and glorify violence

well the work that works for me
might not work for you
no homework i got work to do

gonna be somebody
for anybody tellin me i cant
gonna be someone
for anyone who told me i had no chance
gonna be somebody
im tellin you the time has come like that
gonna be someone
and maybe youll get it when im finally done
and im finally done

yeah this one goes out
to those fantastic human beings
that keep us down and hold us back
you give us fuel for what we do
thanks
