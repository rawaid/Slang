back home
everybodys searching for somethin
but all they can find is a whole lot of nothin
back home
aint nobody hoping and praying
cause they feel like nothing can save em
and they try to hold out but they cant fight the fact that
life goes black when those lights go out
but i guess you gotta just watch out for your own
cause aint a damn thing free
back home

common
back home
they holler disciple and blackstone
same block they freebase yo we trapped on
where our grandmothers marched
the guns clap on
theres liquor stores beauty supplies and rap songs
i travel the world just to come back to it
the crib got a lot of soul like black music
im attached to it
in many ways the city raised me
and gave me
the drama honor and bravery
the streets seem hollow
when i go to chicago
its cheap wine and sorrow
times is hard to swallow
in search of gods tomorrow
i borrow words from the
bible
and use them for survival
gangs rival
signs painted on walls like hieroglyphics
i tell em that this is all tribal
used to do dirt
shortys goin through the same cycle
and trials like michael
tryin not to stay idle

ryu
back home its not compton but close
the same problems exist and the pain throbbin
and folks are so common
it dont
really bother us much we just swallow it
uh
crack the bottle and smoke
hope tomorrow something
magical happens thatll put me back in the biz
but the chances of it actually happenings kinda slim
back home
we get the good life at a glimpse
in the form of a rap star drug dealers and pimps
im back home

tak
back home
i try my best to keep it together its cold
like the windy city streets of december
i pace back and forth
looking for the courage to shine
but cant tap the source
need something to nourish my mind
i know we all lose quite a bit in life
only to gain some
life of the dark winding roads we came from
but i move with the night
so im used to the shade
and never lose sight
bringing truth back to the game

mike
back home
weve got a lot of shit on our minds
were always behind on something cause theres not enough time
and were non-stop
bottom line
doing what we gotta do to get some food in the fridge and stay out of the hosptial
back home theres people calling us hopeless
people trying to tell us all we need is some focus
but focus
focus is overrated
cause you see every blemish and mistake and cant change it
back home is alvarado
k-town and j-town
or little tokyo for those that dont know
where figures shiver
living right in the litter where kids write bigger 
right inside the la river
on the concrete
a symbol of our everyday way
its that color and concentration over the heavy and grey
and by the time the ink dries on this page
ill be half a day away from the place where i stay
