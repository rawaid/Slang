the dude he said that like when we were making the first linkin park record
he was like
yeah you know i dont know about the rapping like i dont know if its like maybe you should just be a rock band
you know what i mean like trying to change us
like they signed us as an act like what we sound like and then hes like
oh i dont know maybe you should just play keyboard

before the first song that you heard me on
there were people already tryin to get me gone
tellin me to quit rapping
just play the keys
that my band had a singer
they didnt need me
but my band had my back
so we did the tracks
put out the album and the talk went flat
it was funny at first but then the humor faded
when some magazines printed that our label made us
we were to be good to be true
some were saying ghost writers were writin all that we do
so we had to disprove it
we spelled it out to the detail how we do it when were making this music
after that i made it a rule
i only do e-mail responses to print interviews
because these people love to put a twist to your words
to infer that you said something fuckin absurd

oh did i lose you at infer
not used to hearing a verse that uses over first grade vocabulary words
people used to infer that we were manufactured
now ive got the interviews on file
which people said what
which number to dial
so now every enemy screaming insanity
all theyre ever gonna bes another big fan of me
bitch

laughter

do you believe that like that was crazy
sounds crazy right
like this point at this point
your thinking you hear it out
your like that guy was out of his mind
but honestly at that point i mean
besides the fact that he wanted me to just
play keyboard or whatever didnt want me to rap
he was like maybe joe hahn should uhhm
wear a lab-coat and a cowboy hat on st like when we play
i swear to god he was crazy
yeah and later on he claimed that he wrote all our songs
so that was that was really nice
