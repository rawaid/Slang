lets go yall

these people are running off at the mouth
tryin to convince me that im running on empty
tryin to convince themselves that the record with jay was a fluke
that the record that im makin is a mistake
and i cant take this
lemme tell you where im at with this
you bastards are gonna have to take back that shit
im not plastic and fake
when i make tracks i take facts and lay them out for the masses
you assholes are gonna see soon that im not playin
start askin me the names that im not sayin
but im tryin to be bigger than the bickerin
bigger than the petty name callin
under the breath talkin
rumors and labels and categorization
im like a struggling doctor no patients
but you can say what you want about me
keep talkin while im walkin away

you can say what you have to say
cause my minds made up anyway
im taking the high road going above you
this is the last time that im gonna trust you
you can say what you have to say
cause my minds made up anyway
all that bullshit you talk might work a lot
but its not gonna work today

you people are running off at the mouth
tryin to make me take myself off safety
tryin to make my friends turn their backs on the team we built
buildin up some mistaken information
and i cant take this
lemme spell it out plain for you
angry groups complain about the things we do
im not changing direction im stepping my game up
maintainin my name the same way i came up
youre gonna see that im not playin
start asking the names that im not sayin
but im tryin not to mention the names of people who wanna siphon attention
you like the hype but pretendin youre part of the picture wont pass
youre like a high school dropout no class
you can say what you want about me
keep talkin while im walkin away bitch

you can say what you have to say
cause my minds made up anyway
im taking the high road going above you
this is the last time that im gonna trust you
you can say what you have to say
cause my minds made up anyway
all that bullshit you talk might work a lot
but its not gonna work today

why does it always have to be
somebodys always watching me
all i really need is some room to breathe
is anybody out there listening
cause i cant stand to keep this in
all i really want ill say it again

you can say what you have to say
cause my minds made up anyway
im taking the high road going above you
this is the last time that im gonna trust you
you can say what you have to say
cause my minds made up anyway
all that bullshit you talk might work a lot
but its not gonna work today
