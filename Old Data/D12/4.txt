this kind of music use it and you get amped to do shit
whenever you hear some shit and you cant refuse it
its just some shit for these kids to trash they rooms with
just refuse whenever they asked to do shit
the type of shit that you dont have to ask who produced it
you just know - thats the new shit
the type of shit that causes mass confusion
and drastic movement of people acting stupid

[verse 1 kon artis]
i come to every club with intention to do harm
with a prosthetic arm and smelling like boones farm
hiding under tables as soon as i hear alarms
paranoid thief thatll steal from his own mom
kuniving kon artist with a bomb
strapped to my stomach screaming lets get it on
a lush that love to drink drunk driving a tank
rollin over a bank cops see me and faint
its drastic im past my limit of coke
i think ill up my high by slitting your throat
push your baby carriage into the street till its mince meat
your mens been beat the minute i step onto your street
this is fight music

[verse 2 bizarre]
you know why my hands are so numb no
cause my grandmother sucked my dick and i didnt cum oh
smacked this whore for talking crap bitch
so what if shes handicapped the bitch said bizarre couldnt rap
i fucking hate you; ill take your drawers down and rape you
while dr dre videotapes you hell yeah
satan done got me on this song
eating a hot dog reading the holy quran while im on the john
tired of wearing this yellow thong
take it back sisqo you know where it belongs thong th-thong thong
now heres a gun ill put it in your palm
now go over there and blow up dru hills arms
fuck your love songs

[verse 3 proof]
just bring who you gon bring on who you gon swing on
im king kong guns blow you to kingdom come
show you machine gun funk
sixteen m-16s and one pump
the snub in my paw shove it in your jaws
have you running out this fucking club in your drawers
we loving the broads theres nothing to applaud
but fuck it its all good the hood is up in us all
its fight music

[verse 4 swifty mcvay]
im a nigga that loves scuffles
and wont hesitate to sock you again for swollen knuckles
im like that catch a nigga like bear traps
blow his head back right in front of the precinct you hear that
i slap your freak bump you and wont speak
if you step on my feet you get drowned in your own drink
i suffocated my shrink just for talking
came back and fucked up his pallbearers and made them drop his coffin
its fight music

[verse 5 kuniva]
these beads im swinging is stinging them
see all these niggas when i step in the club im bringing them
if any nigga looking too hard we rodney kingn them
malice green to them and gasolining them with premium
light a cigarette flick it at them or spit it at them
hold up a picture of his family and kick it at him no
blast while you right hooking right when your wifes looking
fuck fight music bitch this is losing your life music

[verse 6 eminem]
if i could capture the rage of todays youth and bottle it
crush the glass from my bare hands and swallow it
and spit it back in the faces of you racists
and hypocrites who think the same shit but dont say shit
you liberaces versaces and you nazis
watch me cause you figured you got me in this hot seat
you motherfuckers wanna judge me cause youre not me
youll never stop me im top speed as you pop me
i came to save these new generations of babies
from parents who failed to raise them cause theyre lazy
to grow to praise me im making them go crazy
thats how i got this whole nation to embrace me
and you fugazi if you think imma admit wrong
i cripple any hypocritic critic im siced on
and this song is for any kid who gets picked on
a sick song to retaliate to and its called

[hook]

its fight music
