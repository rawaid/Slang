good mornin
haha wake your mother fuckin asses up
you with us or what
well come on then you know what time it is
stop sleepin on my roof bitch

for whatever its worth its worth me havin my ass whipped
cause ima have the last lift that ever gets ass squished
i just cant get past these little pissants
that wanna be rauny bad asses so bad
and they so mad they cant stand it
cause we can and they cant spit haawk
and they cant handle it like a man
and thats when it just happens
and i snap and its a wrap and its a scrap an then it isnt crap is it
hip-hop isnt a sport anymore when you got to go and resort back into that shit
maybe im old fashioned but my pashion 
is to smash anyone rappin without havin a slappin 
believe me id much rather pick up a pencil than a pistol but im pissed now
but it all depends on just how far it gets took on the mic
cause im tellin you right now your not gonna like it
cause if i get pushed over the edge then im pullin you with me
you poke a stick at a pit bull you get bit b
these words stick to you like crazy glue
when you diss me cause they just bounce off me like bullets do fifty
im the beatiful-est thing and your gonna miss me when im gone
like kieth murry when he threw a stool and hit a girl acci-dently argghhh
i do this for swifty kon and kuniva bizzy &amp; proof are you with me

chorus eminem

in a party with heat its hard to keep me without one

constantly popin slugs they hot son better not run
the bosses of all bosses a haluocaust to whoever aint concious
in a house full of dog shit 
ima gothic death project you stop breathin 
you die quicker than mach speed without bleedin
it aint about what you readin
when you meet me better speak like a seasons greetins
either that or well be beefin free when 
you niggaz need a e just to speak shit
your leader is a botique bitch
keep the heater where you can reach quick
i snipe you with it and we wont even keep it a secret
nigga i did it from a mind of a mental patient
when glocks wave you can save that conversation for satan
you brave

in front of every reporter that i dont like
no need for metaphores i get yours across when i write
so emotions enough to say fuck you bitch and i dont like you what 
i might as well give this up like heavy sales
and just fuck an leave d12 and this blunt 
we cant self destruct
ive never felt it this much

kon artis
i walk with a limp pistol hangin off-a the hip
im awkward and quick enough an sick when sparkin a fith
your carcus is split even the beef is partially thick
we cant take you serious you a comedy skit
you probaly wish that you could be out shootin them gs
but the only thing you shoot is the breeze
i cant believe you speaking on movin keys
but every time we hear you kick it 
the only thing you sellin is wolf tickets
i look wicked cause niggas will test your nut sack
so when they bust you better bust back 
and get your guts clapped outa your stomach
and when they want it yeah
i bring a hundred niggas from runave
so get your gun and if you comin
