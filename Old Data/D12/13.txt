i dont wanna go to school i dont need no

i dont wanna be like you
i dont wanna save the nation

i just wanna live my life i dont need no
everyday a celebration self-control
one day ima leave this world
i wait for the revelation

bizarre
i wanna kill myself
im still debating
in front of a baptist church masturbatin
praying to satan
think im crazy cuz i smoke crack
live on b with the mac
in a two family flat fuck it
tired of getting hit in the face with a broom
my moms on her period
my dads in my room daddy no
i got ten rocks that i need to get out
i sold em in five minutes
in my own damn house
my mom smokes crack
my poor grandmother
god bless her soul
the bitch got aids
she was waiting to die of a cold
theres three things to keep me from being a nazi
im black a fag and my dads liberace

kon artis
no matter how bad the beating
i went to school cheating
my dad whooped my ass at a pta meeting
skipping school i had to have nuts just to do it
got born and became truant
when i had the gaul to go
i just couldnt do it
i was lured into corners by this peer pressure shit
how would you feel if you was held
by the tip of a barrel
getting threatened to get your skin
ripped to bone marrow
bet suburban kids
never got rushed for their apparel like me
outcast
last to class
first to leave
when the teacher called on me
best believe
i had something up my sleeve

eminem
i been praised and labeled as crazy
my mother wasnt able to raise me
full of crazy rage
an angry teenager
nothing could change me back
gangsta rap made me act like a maniac
i was boosted and
so influenced by music
i used it as an excuse to do shit
ooh i was stupid
no one could tell me nothing
hip hop overwhelmed me
to the point where it had me in a whole nother realm
it was like isolating myself was healthy
it felt like we was on welfare but wealthy
compelled me to excel when school had failed me
expelled me
and when the principal would tell me i was nothing
and i wouldnt amount to shit
i made my first million and counted it
now look at it
a fucking drop-out that quit
stupid as shit
rich as fuck
and proud of it
thats why

swifty
i was raised with a rifle and mask
steadily beating my psychiatrists ass
just for asking about my past
i was never on that punk shit
fucking around could get your beloved abducted
smothered in blood quick
you couldnt pay swift to give a fuck
was crazy like my father
it must have been poison in that niggas nutt
far as probation
fuck peeing in cups
i violate it anytime
let em see the blunt
i grew up steadily masturbating inside a cell
drunk as hell
having conversations with myself
you could tell i wasnt leniant
a disobedient lynch
that slapped teachers
bitch im not reading it
you dont know what dogs go through
a little nigga sipping liquor
with my old dude
what the fuck you gon do
im quick to curse you
i told my mother that ima hurt you
if you ever again mention a curfew

kuniva
look
my family ignores me and i dont like that
they dont even listen when i tell em
ill be right back
this nice beautiful house mom
it dont mean shit
cuz you know daddys a drunk
and he dont clean shit
and yesterday he hit me like a grown fucking man
i couldnt stand up to him
i just ducked and ran
im sick of this
i wish on christmas
that i can get a loaded four-fifth
and put a fucking end to this fuck it
i got no friends and i cant get a bitch
only thing i have is dirty magazines and sticky fingertips
nothing to smile about
im about to lose my mind
got me an automatic nine
now im wildin out

proof
when schools over
pupil or people to shoot through
kids going cuckoo
with a two-two
since my friend is this new dude
in his high school
losing his noodle
learning people dont like you
the football jocks is
spitting on him
popular kids in school thats now picking on him
burn out youngsta niggas now hitting on him
and his teacher in his english class keep flipping on him
and now hes grounded with no allowances
for drinking forty ounces
cuz he was caught by his counselors
and why the fuck i gotta ride the bench coach
already got expelled for wearing a trenchcoat
all i ever seen is
violence violence
told me to keep silent
stop batting my eyelids
its apparent that my parents werent parents at all
thats why i blow out my brains
and murdered you allfuck you
