swifty

just for askin
they must have been wanting to meet the lord
when my parents talked to me they got mean mugged and ignored
they was snoopin trough my closet
seein drugs on the floor
shells from the forty four scattered over they porch
bussin pistols in your windows with intentions to destroy you
tryin to break your neck to conversate
bitch i l do it for you
catch me laughin at your funeral when they lower you
you and your hoe
you gots to go
bitches died slow and horrible
theres no tomorrow fo any nigga
well shower you
we young strapped and powerful
and i aint gotta lie to you

proof
stepped in the door wavin the fo fo
blazin at popo
escapin and lay low
they call my tongue yayo
but i spit fire
i lit five inside a fuckin dickrider
the clip slider

you love bein ass to ass
grab a gun by the nose with the but the gat spank ya

yo my trigga got the flu and this gat might cough
it aint nuttin to tell
empty shells for the witness

i squeeze of this tech until nothing remains

chorus

kuniva
he only time that im at peace is when im close to one
cuz i dont know whats waitin for me when my vocals are done
toke the gun
its my way of life and it works
these cowardly niggazll put your fuckin life in the dirt
cause it was wrong how they left my dawg he was priceless
alone in the streets bleedin starin layin lifeless
thats why im heated
you never know who start creepin
wakin you up with aks while you lie sleepin
id rather pack the heat and not need it
rather then need one and not have it
i married this glockmatic

nowhere without my gun

kon artist
you know the sound when im spinnin rounds
spittin these rounds from fo pounds
while the whole crowd is screamin this loud from they mouth
is they possibly alive
*shooting and screaming*
nothing is parrallel to makin you carousel aerial somersault
like fast wheels who will perish shells
denaun carry the nine where i go
bullets whistling hit you while im shootin at five-os
so semi-automatic with statics to mottos
swingin like columbine kids from colorado

chorus
