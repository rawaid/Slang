when i drive-by six people and five i hit woops

squashed a bitch and stomped her foster kids argh
these shrooms make me hallucinate
then i sweat till i start losin weight
till i see dumb shit start happenin
dumber than vanilla ice tryin to rap again
so bounce bounce come on bounce
gunfire i said come on bounce
