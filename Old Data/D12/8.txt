and automatically explode on motherfuckers until they mouth be closed permanently
you get burned until i quickly you can not hit me niggaz to terrified to come get me
tempt me if you think swifty wont send a slug people run 
when the reaper comes the repercussions gon leak your blood 
inglewood steppin without a weapon you leave you gone 
im still runnin with stolen toasters while on parole 
snatch you out our home like eviction notices hoe 
when i unload im known to never leave witnesses to roam 
when im blowed ill write the wicked in scroll 
at the toll when im sober im prone to roll up and disconnect your soul *****

kuniva
now its proven its about to be a misunderstanding 
in furniture moving bullets flying lawyers &amp; mothers suing 
cause niggas dont know the difference you bitches just stick to fiction 
its sickening you cant even walk in my jurisdiction rippin it 
grippin the pump and who wanna fuck with a walking psychopathic 
pyromaniac shady cats with 80 gats 
and maybe thats the reason that you gon get it the worst a
and since you jumpin in front of everybody you gon get it first 
i disperse the crowd with something vigor and versatile 
so go on and record you verses now while you got a mouth
and its not a joke its some kind of riddle 
kunizzle will lift up a 12 gizzle and throw a party from my acquittal 
and a glock that  stop you from walking 
bulletsll hit your liver ill even shoot native americans 
a  nigga we back in you life and back in your wife 
hit you in the back with a knife and get it crackin tonight
