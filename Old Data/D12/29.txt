plus my man in the closet ran out of videotape

chorus

thats when you find out that life aint truly what it seems
all these hoes be lyin bullshittin each other
and why the hell kobe bryant didnt wear a rubber
he might as well have went and told the hoe that he love her

wantin to fight everytime you show up at a gig
she front row with her friends flippin you off
follow you to the bar the bathroom

until you blackout now you and the hoe is havin a scrapout
you get locked up for assault and now you asked out
