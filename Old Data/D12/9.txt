yo thats right motherfuckers we back
same slanging
orangutaning
wilding out on hoodrats that say i act
like im too famous
to say hi and tell em what my name is
but really im still nameless
you niggas dont get it yet do you
kill or not
platinum or flop
ill still put it through you
with a luger thatll spit fire
and hit higher
than a pitch by a bitch like mariah
you think for one second since we got a deal
that we wont deal with you in front of st andrews still
you gay rappers better learn that
i wont stop until i see em turn back
if you dont slow that road you pack
you gon see these runyan ave niggas
that really need some prozac
to show that ask the others
brigadell lay you down
next to your mothers mothers grandmothers

kuniva
you know im feeling real rowdy tonight
ready to fight
and half the niggas i give dat to
i dont even like
the same cat who never gave a damn about your name
i gives a fuck about it
like the next la clippers game
ill kill you in ways you couldnt even fathom
you and yo madam
its really unexplainable how i have em
who call theyselves screaming about a challenge
nigga we got a gift while you barely making it off of mere talent
my skills are deeply imbedded
even your hoe said it
she was knock-kneed
i fucked her now she bow-legged
in the middle of rapping i drop the mic
and have a stare down and jump in the crowd and start scrapping
kuniving kon artis my nigga we get it cracking
while the paramedics pick you up we on the side laughing

chorus kon artis x2
shit can happen
this aint funny so dont you dare laugh
shit can happeeen
shit can happen to him and your ass

you can be touched dont think you cant
shit can happeeen
cuz niggas aint fucking around no more man

swifty
the feds cant hold me why
i hold feds
i was born with a dark ass cloud over my head uh huh
raining acid nigga
you cant refrain from getting your ass kicked
cuz you talk too much
you asked for it
im on some massive shit
everybody ignore me
they wouldnt fuck with me if i was performing at an orgy
these niggas think im fronting what up now
then they change stories
i catch you and they thinking everythings hunky dory
i even have you pour me the gasoline for me do it
pulling up slowly
cop tailing your homies
met a lot of niggas but you wouldnt wanna know me for real
your ass might not even make it home with your roley nigga
dont even try
in your system like eco lie
trying to beef with me
nigga please your people die
im so wicked that my momma gave birth illegally uh huh
i survived the abortion immediately surprise

eminem
picture me sitting in a jail cell rotting
or barricaded in a motel with twelve shotguns
when the *cops* come knocking
each hands got one
cocked ready to dump slugs heavy as shot puts
one man army
guns cant harm me
young and ornery
worse than my uncle ronnie
ever since i got my first gun pulled on me
i cant stop airing out my dirty laundry
middle fingers flip at censorship
your friends just flipped
over this swift penmanship
ever since i spit some shit on infinite
i been giving it a hundred and ten percent
cuz when i vent most of my energys
spent on enemies
eighty percent of what i invent is hennessy
and twenty percent is from being hungry as sin
ten is because i love being under your skin
ya shit shit can happen
so stick to rapping
quit the yapping
or ima lift the mac in
that can lead to another mishap happening
skip the crap
get the can of whoop ass cracking

chorus x2

outro eminem
shit can happen
it can and it will
shit can happeeen
fuck around with amityville
shit can happen
and you die
insanity still
shit can happeeen
mentality of twelve motherfuckers in six different bodies
shit can happen
with their personality split
shit can happeeen
fucking you up with hit after hit
shit can happen
sticking you up with clip after clip
shit can happeeen
making you suck dick after dick
shit can happen
shit can happeeen
dirty motherfuckin dozen
