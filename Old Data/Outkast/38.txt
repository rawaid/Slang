ahhhh  i stank i can i stank i can
the funky engine that could
oooo  oooo
yosky  wosky pisky  wisky
all aboard the stankonia express
the underground smell road
everybodys lookin for an excuse to let loose
whats your locomotive the chattanooga choo choo

chorus
humble as a mumble in the jungle
of shouts and screams
thats the way the cracker crumbles
so i guess ive got to re-route my dreams
repeat

big boi
back on the microphone your number one controller
i rock the microphone like a blizzard
im so cold im tryin to hold ya
life is like a great big roller coaster
everything in life dont always happen like its suppose to
trials and tribulations make you stronger live longer
you wanna reach the nation nigga start from ya corner
everything dont always happen like you plan it
demand it over stand it then you handle it
fuck wishing you missing the ambition on your mission
now you switching why you quitting cause its heated in the kitchen
sloppy slipping in your pimping nigga
you either pistol whip the nigga or you choke the trigger
youve got to follow through struggle to complete your dreams
no weapon formed against prospers 5417
from isaiah lay a nigga down and spray em
if the dealer dealt a fucked up hand of cards youve gotta play em

chorus

too democratic republic fuck it
we chicken nugget we dip in the sauce like mop and bucket
blue-collar scholars wholl take your dollar and wipe my ass wit it
you living for the lotto never hit it i met a critic
i made her shit her drawers
she said she thought hip hop was only guns and alcohol
i said oh hell naw but yet its that too
you cant discrimahate cause you done read a book or 2
what if i looked at you in a microscope saw all the dirty organisms
living in your closet would i stop and would i pause it whoo
to put that bitch in slower motion got the potion and the antidote
and a quote for collision the decision
is do you want to live or wanna exist
the game changes everyday so obsolete is the fist and marches
speeches only reaches those who already know about it
this is how we go about it

chorus

erykah badu
im wild just like a rock a stone a tree
and im free just like the wind the breeze that blows
and i flow just like a brook a stream the rain
and i fly just like a bird up in the sky
and ill surely die just like a flower plucked
and dragged away and thrown away
and then 1 day it turns to clay
it blows away it finds a ray it finds its way
and there it lays until the rain and sun
then i breathe just like the wind the breeze that blows
and i grow just like a baby breastfeeding
and its beautiful thats life and thats life
and thats life and thats life

chorus

andre
humble as a mumble in the jungle
of shouts and screams
thats the way the cracker crumbles
so i guess ive gotta re-route my dreams
yall cant harm me its over
