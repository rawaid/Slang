many a day has passed the night has gone by
but still i find the time to put that bump off in your eye
total chaos for these playas thought we was absent
we taking another route to represent the dungeon family

like grade a me and and my nigga decide to take the back way
we stabbin every city when we headed to that bat cave
a-t-l georgia what we do for ya
bull doggin hoes like them georgetown hoyas

boy you soundin silly thank my brougham aint sittin pretty
doin doughnuts round you suckas like them circles around titties 
damn we the committee  gone burn it down
but us gone bust you in the mouth with the chorus now

i met a gypsy and she hipped me to some life game
to simulate then activate the left and right brain
said baby boy youre only funky as your last cut
you focus on the past your assll be a has but

thats one to live by or either thats one to die to
i try to just throw it at you determine your own adventure andr√©
got to her station heres my destination
she got off the bus the conversation lingered in my head for hours

took a shower kinda sour cause my favorite group aint commin wit it
but im with you cause you probably goin through it anyway
but anyhow when in doubt went on out and bought it
cause i thought it would be jammin but examine all the flawsky-wasky
awfully sad and its costly but thats all shit

broke and i hope i never have to float in that boat
up shits creek its weak is the last quote
that i want to hear when im goin down when alls said and done
and we got a new joe in town
when the record playa get skippin and slowin down
all yall can say is them niggas earned that crown but until then

everybody move to tha back of the bus
do you wanna bump and slump with us
