verse 1 andre 3000
its beginning to look a lot like what 
follow my every step take notes on how i crept
im bout to go in depth this is the way i greet
my reason heres my ghetto rep i kept
to say the least no no it cant cease
so i begin to piece my two and two together gots no snowy weather
have to find something to do better bet
i said subtract so shut up that nonsense about some solid solid i got
say crunk if it aint real it aint right im like no matter what the season
forever chill with smith i sip my fifth i chill with wesson
i got my reason so tell me what did you expect
you thought id break my neck to help yall deck the halls oh
naw i got no other means of celebrating im getting blizzard at ho-jo
i gots that hoochie waiting i made it through to another year
cant ask for nothing much mo its outkast
for the books i thought you knew so now you know lets go

hook all the players came from far and wide
wearing afros and braids in every gangstar ride
now im here to tell yah theres a better day
when the players ball is happenin on all day ayanday

verse 2 big boi
hallelujah hallelujah you know i do some thing  
much different than i used to cause im a playa doin what the playas do
the package store is closed okay my day is woofin 
this is ridiculous im getting serious im getting curious
cause the house is smelling sick of chittlings all this vicious
i make no wishes cause the modern folk is in the back getting tipsy
off the noggin how ya settlin for contact smoke
they havin a smoke out in my back seat
they passing erb rewinding verses cause its in the air
i hit the parks i hit the cuts im making switches
clickin the switches side to side looking for old snitches
im wide open on the freeway my pager broke my vibe
cause a junkie is a junkie three-sixty-five
its just anothr day of work to me the spirit just aint in me
grab my pistol and my ounce see what these junkies got to give me
cause its like that yeah forever pimpin never slippin
thats how it is check it

verse 3 big boi

just to let you know cause in 1993 thats how we comin 
so hoe hoe hoes check my kings ass fro the gin 
and juice got me tipsy so on
andre 3000

the corners in my cadillac my heart does not go pity-pat for no rat
im leaning back my elbows out the window coke rum and indo
fills my body wheres the party we roll deep we dip to underground
