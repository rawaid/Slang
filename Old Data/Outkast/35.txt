yo this is my story this is my song
and to them rudypoots dont attempt to try this at home
its just a poem until yall learn right from wrong
know when to bless a situation when to grab the chrome

but its back on another stormy night in atlanta georgia
overcast but on behalf of outkast i cordially
invite you to an emotion filled theater
bring your umbrellas cause young fella it gets no weirder

we reign reign supreme preme dungeon dungeon kings
do you know what it brings rats mice snakes up out they hole
chonkyfire spliced with rock nroll indubitably piper pied
now hold on my brother no no no no cant stop the stride

do you know what it brings rats mice snakes up out they hole
chonkyfire spliced with rock nroll indubitably piper pied
now hold on my brother no no no no cant stop the stride

you are now about entering the fifth demension of ascension
our only intention is to take you high
high yeah yeah my lord

to make one bob they head would be the track job
tour jobs to spit that fire
some of yall mcs take this rhymin for granted i wont comply
with that slackin poppin and crackin 4th ward way we snappin
they wont that hardness that oddness that gets a nigga to start this

whats happenin see if do what yo wont do today boy
will i live tommorrow like you cant even live cause you strayed
motivational skills lackin when i see you nigga packin
understand that though you behind a $75000 car do

still stay with mom though playin the king like don doe
you chocked up you was the nigga that supposed to be locked up
makin them thick hip-hop is dead exhume the body if you aint scared
and if i see you in the streets id dap you down like you was greg

we reign reign supreme preme dungeon dungeon kings
do you know what it brings rats mice snakes up out they hole
chonkyfire spliced with rock nroll indubitably piper pied
now hold on my brother no no no no cant stop the stride

do you know what it brings rats mice snakes up out they hole
chonkyfire spliced with rock nroll indubitably piper pied
now hold on my brother no no no no cant stop the stride

do you know what it brings rats mice snakes up out they hole
chonkyfire spliced with rock nroll indubitably piper pied
now hold on my brother no no no no cant stop the stride

do you know what it brings rats mice snakes up out they hole
chonkyfire spliced with rock nroll indubitably piper pied
now hold on my brother no no no no cant stop the stride
