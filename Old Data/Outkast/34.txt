somethings gotta give

yeah you know what im sayin uhh
herring homes unh martel homes carver homes tekwood
martin luther king bankhead

verse one big boi

under-cover over da hills and thru tha woods i go
like green lights a southern nigga thats comin fo yo throat
but not no guillotine see we be them southern playas
remember the football socks aerobic reeboks and decaturs now
you up to par and ready fo yo lesson
i got an ounce of dank and a couple of drinks so lets crank up a session
like tri-city high school was pullin em in a broke down rabbit
i spit a couple of words and layin em down was just a habit
just like smokey choking off da pee-wee that we rolled up
talkin about the click will get you laid down hella swoled up
hootie hoo slapped ya boyz across the cheek wit isotoners
and went to tell yo momma and yo pop that you was a goner
tell em big boi did it; i swear that nigga be rhymin
every lyric that he spit be turnin charcoals into diamonds and pearls
girl when you givin up them draws cause
i got a couple of niggaz down the hall
that wanna hit it too im not the type to be actin selfish
set it out and let it out and ill be right back just like elvis
cause the postman rings twice
hey mr postman

chorus repeat 2x

power power i come gimme some
tha deadly voice over drums we from atl
put tha swats swats on yo car
lets travel far tha southern star shines

verse two dre

everybody wanna get signed but here to tell you
record companies act like pimps
gettin paid off what we made when we the ones thats fly like blimps
but aint no goodyear i tell it like it is so im like look here
just willin to get what i deserve my kids to have a mother
and a little house with a dog in the backyard goin woof-woof
who knows what ima say soons i leave this recording booth
poof back in the real world where birds fly
from miami by way of cuba to whoever wants to get that high
theres clouds of clowns seas of gs
pro-jects packed with playas meditating on their knees
just to make them ends meet like ground beef you wont believe
the shit that niggaz attempt cause they got other mouths to feed
besides they own

chorus

verse three big boi

theres some hoes in this house damn right
im thinkin about the way you skull me guzz me
suckin me dry like deserts mojave gotti hotties and honeydips
likin the way you do me screw me it make my money flip
shakin that ass for daddy puttin this gas off in my cadi-llac
back dont ever snap packin the gats and pimpin whores
hors doevres swerve hit the curb because im reckless
back in the days when i was broke id snatch your fuckin necklace 
you ol pussy-ass nigga yeah
