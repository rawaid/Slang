1 2 1 2 3; yeah
in-slum-national underground
thunder pounds when i stomp the ground woo
like a million elephants and silverback orangutans
you cant stop a train
who want some dont come un-prepared
ill be there but when i leave there
better be a household name
weather man tellin us it aint gon rain
so now we sittin in a drop-top soaking wet
in a silk suit tryin not to sweat
hit somersaults without the net
but thisll be the year that we wont forget
one-nine-nine-nine anno domini anything goes be whatchu wanna be
long as you know consequences are given for livin
the fence is too high to jump in jail
too low to dig i might just touch hell
hot get a life now they on sale
then i might cast you a spell look at what came in the mail
a scale and some arm and hammer soul gold grill and some baby mama
black cadillac and a pack of pampers
stack of question with no answers
cure for cancer cure for aids
make a nigga wanna stay on tour for days
get back home things are wrong
well not really it was bad all along
before you left adds up to a ball of power
thoughts at a thousand miles per hour
hello ghetto let your brain breathe
believe theres always more ahhhhh

[chorus 2x]
[dre] dont pull that thang out unless you plan to bang
[choir] bombs over baghdad
[dre] yeah ha ha yeah

[choir] bombs over baghdad
[dre] yeah uhh-huh

[big boi]
uno dos tres its on
did you ever think a pimp rock a microphone
like that there boy and we still stay street
big things happen every time we meet
like a track team crack fiend dying to geek
outkast bumpin up and down the street
slant back cadillac bout five nigga deep
seventy-five mcs freestylin to the beat
cause we get crunk stay crunk at the club
should have bought an ounce but you copped a dub
should have held back but you throwed the punch
spose to meet your girl but you packed a lunch
no d to the u to the g for you
got a son on the way by the name of bamboo
got a little baby girl four years jordan
never turned my back on my kids there for them
should have hit it quit it rag top
before you re-up get a laptop
make a business for yourself boy set some goals
make a fat diamond out of dusty coals
record number four but we on a roll
hold up slow up stop control
like janet planet stankonia is on ya
movin like floyd comin straight to florida
lock all your windows then block the corridors
pullin off my belt cause a whippings in order
i like a three piece fish before i cut your daughter
yo quiero taco bell then i hit the border
pity pat rappers tryin to get the five
im a microphone fiend tryin to stay alive
when you come to atl boy you better not hide
cause the dungeon family gon ride hah

[chorus 2x]
[dre] dont pull the thang out unless you plan to bang
