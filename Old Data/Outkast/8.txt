well its the m - i - crooked letter aint no one better
and when im on the microphone you best to wear your sweater
cause im cooler than a polar bears toenails
oh hell there he go again talkin that shit
bend corners like i was a curve i struck a nerve
and now you bout to see this southern playa serve
i heard its not where youre from but where you pay rent
then i heard its not what you make but how much you spent
you got me bent like elbows amongst other things but im not worried
cause when we step up in the party like im out-you-scurry
so go get your fuckin shine box and your sack of nickles
it tickles to see you try to be like mr pickles
daddy fat sacks b-i-g b-o-i
its that same motherfucka that took them knuckles to your eye
and i try to warn you not to test but you dont listen
givin a shout out to my uncle donnell locked up in prison

and now im sittin at the end of the month i just made it
like you made the b team and like the daddys wife you makin the coffee
you heard the a-t-l-iens so back the hell up off me

[andre]
softly as if i played piano in the dark
found a way to channel my anger not to embark
the worlds a stage and everybodys got to play their part
god works in mysterious ways so when he starts
the job of speakin through us we be so sincere with this here
no drugs or alcohol so i can get the signal clear as day
put my glock away i got a stronger weapon
that never runs out of ammunition so im ready for war okay

now throw your hands in the air
and wave em like you just dont care
and if you like fish and grits and all that pimp shit
everybody let me hear you say o yea-er
now throw your hands in the air
and wave em like you just dont care
and if you like fish and grits and all that pimp shit
everybody let me hear you say o yea-er
