[verse 1 andre 3000]
youre all ive ever wanted but im terrified of you
my castle may be haunted but im terrified of you
ive cast my spell on millions but im terrified of you
baby i do this from the ceiling but im terrified of you

[bridge]
i wait my whole life to bite the right one
then you come along and that freaks me out
so im frightenedohdraculas wedding

[verse 2]
ive never ran from no one but im terrified of you
see my heartbeat is a slow one but im terrified of you
ive been around for ages but im terrified of you
put my fang across the stage but yet im terrified of you

[bridge]

[kelis]
3000 x4

give me a chance to dance romance
dont run im not the sun
so much at stake oh bad choice of words
but im not the gun with silver bullets
and i can count 1 2 3 plus i make great peanut butter
and jelly sandwiches van helsing

for richer or poorer through sickness and in health
till death do us part till death do us part
you only live once well not in our case cause we live forever
