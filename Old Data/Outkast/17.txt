from the bottom of my lungs a nigga be blowin spittin his game
comin up on ya from the south the a-t-liens aint changed
cooler than most players claim to be
a nigga thats from the a-town see
the home of the bankhead bounce campbellton road and other city streets
enough of the verality fallacy butter we speak not fiction
speakin of pullin yo girl lookin at jheri curls you bitches
everytime i ryhme for yall im lookin to prove a point
kickin a freestyle every now and then
but mostly off the joint
see i smoke good cuz see it go good wit them flows why
the nigga the b-i-g like tony rich nobody knows why
but me and my folks cuz yall niggas jokes like the joker
im sick of these wack ass rappers like im tired of hoes in chokers

who dem boyz that be havin the cronk every occasion 
this side niggaz dustin that side niggaz lacin
but in the middle we stay calm we just drop bombs
askin where we come fromsouth post lodge

[chorus]

its just two dope boyz in a cadillac [2x]

[verse two andre big boi]

this ol sucka mc stepped up to me
challenged andre to a battle and i stood there patiently
as he spit and stumbled over cliches so called freestylin
whole purpose just to make me feel low i guess you whylin
i say look boi i aint for that fuck shit; so fuck this
let me explain on this child style so you dont miss
i grew up to myself not round no park bench
just a nigga bustin flows off in apartments

now who dem boyz that be havin the cronk every occasion 
this side niggaz dustin that side niggaz lacin
but in the middle we stay calm we just drop bombs
askin where we come fromsouth post slums

[chorus]

[verse three big boi andre]

it goes chromes to the fleetwoods coups to the villes
hittin girbauds and off these flows we havin the playa chill
in this atmosphere this aint no practice here we cuttin the fool now
im doin ya at the house and throwin you out because im through now
dont you love the way we clamin bankhead stankhead
lookin around the swats for the herb thats never tainted
fainted when you heard the bourbon servin on the block
and all you bitin indivuals need to check yourselfs and stop

yeah tight like nuts and bolts sluts and hoes that get evicted
im dealin wit queens in my castle aint worth to risk it
now tricks be lookin at me like im they way up out the pro-jects
cant put you on my payroll and no i aint got no rolex
or no diamond at the exit with a sign sayin well rap for food
my face is bawled up cuz i aint in a happy mood
while my partner got the squeegee and the windex
cuz somewhere in my life i done went wrong jus like a syntax
error bring the terror to your dome like pe
prone to finish this out cuz this be a free-style

now who dem boyz that be havin the cronk every occasion 
this side niggaz dustin that side niggaz lacin
but in the middle we stay calm 
we just drop
