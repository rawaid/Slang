even the sun goes down heroes eventually die
horoscopes often lie and sometimes y
nothing is for sure nothing is for certain nothing lasts forever
but until they close the curtain
its him and i aquemini

now is the time to get on like spike lee said get on the bus
go get your work and keep your beeper chirping is a must
is you on that dust or cornstarch familiar with that smack man
the music is like that green stuff provided to you by sack man

pac-man how in the fuck you think we gon do that man
riding around old national on 18s without no gat man
im strapped man and already to bust on any nigga like that man
me and my nigga we roll together like batman and robin

we prayed together through hard times and swung hard when it was fitting
but now we tappin the brakes from all of them corners that we be headin in
a volkswagen and bonnevilles chevrolets and coupe de villes
if you aint got no rims nigga dont go get wood grain steering wheel

for real you can gon chill out and still build
let your paper stack instead of going into overkill
pay ya fuckin beeper bill bitch

even the sun goes down heroes eventually die
horoscopes often lie and sometimes y
nothing is for sure nothing is for certain nothing lasts forever
but until they close the curtain
its him and i aquemini

twice upon a time there was a boy who died and
lived happily ever after but thats anotha chapter live
from home of the brave with dirty dollas
and beauty parlors and baby bottles and bowling ball impalas
and street scholars that majoring in culinary arts
you know how to work bread cheese and dough
from scratch but see the catch is you can get caught
know what ya selling what cha bought so cut that big talk

lets walk to the bridge now meet me half way
now you may see some children dead off in the pathway
its them poor babies walkin slowly to the candy lady
its lookin bad need some hope like the words maybe if

or problay
more than a hobby when my turntables get wobbly they dont fall
im sorry yall i often drift im talkin gift
so when it comes you never look the horse inside its grill

of coarse you know i feel like a bearer of bad news
dont want to be it but its needed so what have you
now question is every nigga wit dreads for the cause
is every nigga with golds for the fallno
so dont get caught in appearance
its outkast aquemini another black experience

okay

even the sun goes down heroes eventually die
horoscopes often lie and sometimes y
nothing is for sure nothing is for certain nothing lasts forever
but until they close the curtain
its him and i aquemini

the name is big boi daddy fat sax the nigga that like them cadillacs
i stay down with these streets cause these strets is where my folks at
betta know that some say we pro-black boy we professional
we missed a lot of church so the music is our confessional

get off the testicles and the nut sacks
you must bust a rhyme we must bust back
get get back for reals niggas thats out here trying to spit facts
you here dat you cant come near dat maybe you need yo quit
because aquemini is aquarius and gemini runnin shit like this
yeah yeah yeah

my mind warps and bends floats the wind count to ten
meet the twin andré ben welcome to the lions den
original skin many men comprehend
i extend myself so you go out tell a friend

sin all depends on what you believing in
faith is what you make it thats the hardest shit since mc ren
alien can blend right on in wit yo kin
look again cause i swear i spot one every now and then

its happening again wish i could tell you when
andré this is andré yall just gon have to make amends

even the sun goes down heroes eventually die
horoscopes often lie and sometimes y
nothing is for sure nothing is for certain nothing lasts forever
but until they close the curtain
its him and i aquemini
