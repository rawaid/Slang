verse 1

revolutionary scary
thought provoking spoken
words of a chain i dont feel but i see 
visions from me
at twenty three making us free in my community
one day is what i live for 
aint thinking about no hope no more
i got my boots i kick it till i get with
adapt and overcome oh hum hum
go get my gun load up for fun and put down with the frown
what goes round comes round from mlk to cascade
i know its through them plenty figures 
cocaine dealers walk the wrong side
up in they rides 
looking cleaner then i seen them the last time
then selling dimes now its quarter keys stacking gs
in the south indies 
my nigga them folks riding bicycles among vehicles
off in the hood
knowing each and every nigger sellin but can you blame 
the fact the only way a brother can survive the game
the block hard to get by the dope dealing fatal killings
in fair times so writing rhymes 
it aint just the police
we kill each other just lost another brother
fast living will get you took 
thinking it cant happen to you and then it do 
off crooked schemes its just a dream 
floating face down in the mainstream

chorus

think it is when it aint all peaches and cream
thats why some are found floating face down in the main stream

verse 2

they swan divin
fit they name be thrashing an album
go-kart rushin to finish their album then you find them
lost dog paddling back stroking what done happened
be rhymin catching the day when the recipe calls for black and
wrong ingredients
maybe too much herbs and spices 
maybe you got hungry for the wrong dish 
southern greens and this entice them how them joke the same
so im gonna sing just like them to get where they at 
ill even break my by back to touch their rim if i gotta
my alta mater be that i follow
i bite whatever thats looking tasty water it down then swallow
i hope you vomit wont call no names cause thats not my job
it just applies to whom it may concern you know who you are
but if you dont you never will you just receive the steel
but then it might get ugly cause trust me niggas do feel 
the way that i felt when i wrote this but we must stay in focus
we kings and queens up in this thing get rid of all them jokers
face down face down face down

chorus

verse 3

i let you stay in my crib now you know where i live
when you was hungry fed you a hot meal look at the hand you deal
me crudball business giving niggas inches so here take a foot
luck only counts in rabbits feet and horseshoes
experience is sometimes the best teacher until we get our own plate
i hope you dont mind me eating off of yours 
process momma moping like jerry
meanwhile fairies of the street tinkling pixie dust over greenery
never to obtain another level of con-science
only to test to poke and see
why laying here they scheme over one another mouth to feed
 with a decision to make now words shape your destiny
but a missle will take it all the way just as quick as you can say 
i wish i never did what i did now face this biz
it was the company you kept the many places you slept
when you shouldnt have geekin like a rat jumping like a trap
contributing to sin and your nigga bitch in the club showin pink for ten
they got you niggas where they want you again
floating face down in the mainstream
thats why thats why thats why

chorus

verse 4

everybodys a player rubbin them kangols on their head
thinking its all about your clothes nigger its all about your self
the way you feel about your life the times that you done shared with
your friends and family up and down like hoes give head
to dicks oh six serving them in the mix but aint no mystery
you know the history about this clique bitch
oh what you want me to call you slut
then why you fucking all them niggers letting them all up in your guts
but see that aids im afraid thats why i play the quiet role
i lay in the cut every month thinking ill let that fire roll
like chimneys and smoke signals maybe peace pipes even
my partners call me big boi and my first name is not steven
in the mainstream home team banging them with these hits
in the mix flowing like some motherfucking swordfish
