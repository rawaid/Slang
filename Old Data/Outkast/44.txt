me and everything around me is unstable like chernobyl
ready to go at any moment jumpin like a pogo stick
i never lived up to my expectations so i accept the patience
expect the worse but now im pacin
back and forth inside im melting like water on wicked bitches
a monster truck done came and ran over my picket fences
i had the best of life in my clinches but monkey wrenches was thrown
like chairs kings sit on my prayers seem to long
i fall asleep before the endin dont even get to say amen
i hope he understand i be on bended knees
at times i think im crazy so i say forget it
or maybe its the devil infiltrating and like riddickbowe
ive been fighting this since them fetus days
i count from one to twenty when im through repeat the phrase
its just a phase its gon all pass but that gets old too
im weakening like a deacon doin dirt
what am i supposed to do

see from bedknobs to broomsticks we lookin to start some new shit
im writin this rhyme in faith so when you hear it hope you true it
my nigga you do it like swooshes the lyrical cleanse and new zits
wipin away your germs up under your cranium with juices
see mo goes on my slick flow flows on
straight from west savannah georgia but the swats is my home
never go wrong cuz the click is tighter than gnat ass and that bad
mosquito now we goes im proud of you peoples
for sellin your cracker sacks im glad im white not black
shit on the real thats how them whiteys really act
when your back was turned them slackers learned and now we fallin apart
you lookin me in my eye but you aint feelin me in your heart
yes yes lord give me the power within the final hour
these niggaz they leavin me stranded like rapunzel in the tower
now or never lets stick together and overcome
but they dont feel like marchin cuz they shoes is overrun
aint that a bitch
