take a little trip hater back up yo mind
look forward not behind then youll see what you find
i caught a sucker dyin cause he thought could rhyme
now if his momma is a quarter daughter must be a dime
i gotta meet her dont take no shorts i dont use abbrevi-
-ation i dont even play the radio neither
only if i need to know the sports or the weather
im a cool type of brother but yep your head ill sever
from the neck - see aint nuttin changed hit the stage
set a date sucker in battle we can engage
ill slice you wife you marry you divorce you
throw the porsche at you is what im forced to do
with my back against the wall crack his back yall
naw it aint went nowhere like havin hair with stylin gel in it
throw a curl in it
dread that nappy shit fuck throw a shell in it
whatever floats your boat or finds your lost remote
and this for dem niggaz workin at the airport
who got laid off i take my shades off
if you look straight in my eyes you still might see a disguise
because the whole whole world world

cause the whole world loves it when you dont get down
bah bah-da bah bah bah-da 
and the whole world loves it when you make that sound
bah bah-da bah bah bah-da 
and the whole world loves it when youre in the news
bah bah-da bah bah bah-da 
and the whole world loves it when you sing the blues
bah bah-da bah bah bah-da 

killer mike
player i grind my focus is crime
raw with the rhyme im slick with the slime
my words are diamonds dug out a mine
spit em polish look how they shine
glitter glisten gloss floss
i catch a beat runnin like randy moss
ride dat bitch off like a brand new horse
im rollin my stone gatherin no moss
mami im comin i hope you get off
or rock your own boat like aaliyah then talk
back back forth forth
get that sailor on fourth fourth
make that track a fourth fouth
rap roll utterly rocked
with my mouth to the mic and my hand on my cock
cadillac outkast just wont stop

cause the whole world loves it when you dont get down
bah bah-da bah bah bah-da 
and the whole world loves it when you make that sound
bah bah-da bah bah bah-da 
and the whole world loves it when youre in the news
bah bah-da bah bah bah-da 
and the whole world loves it when you sing the blues
bah bah-da bah bah bah-da 

big boi
turn on the tv and everything is lookin dismal
went in the bathroom medicine cabinet pepto-bismal
need it for my stomach cause my tummy kinda aches
like a junkie on withdrawal fresh up off the plate
wait back to the enemy of the state
is the republicans or democratic candidate
debate now even the black box hold the fate
clueless like shaggy and scooby befo commercial break
hate extreme prejudice lets dismiss this
if you want to you can dub it to your hit list
i know you gon to we in this to replenish yo musical wish list
when it come to this music we stay relentless
pursuing all thats pursuable
doing gods willing all things that are do able
the only liable limitation is to self
dre set it on the right and i set it on the left cause

cause the whole world loves it when you dont get down
bah bah-da bah bah bah-da 
and the whole world loves it when you make that sound
bah bah-da bah bah bah-da 
and the whole world loves it when youre in the news
bah bah-da bah bah bah-da 
and the whole world loves it when you sing the blues
bah bah-da bah bah bah-da
