intro big boi

uhh
as i sit in my b-boy stance
with flip-flops and socks and sweatpants
we finna enhance your brain check it out

verse one big boi andre

once upon a time not long ago
when the playa from the pointe didnt have no doe
a nigga hit me for my tennis shoes walkin to the sto
caught a nigga slippin but now i lay it to the flo
just like carpet cuz i got the heat in my rhythm
momma nay not never braggin just to stay knot
even when i was a younger lad i learned my lesson
never talked to strangers in the trap and answered questions

the pope and his folks got us under a scope
but for unknown reasons cuz we dont sell dope
that you distribute we dont contribute to your clandestine
activity my soliloquoy may be hard for some to swallow
but so is cod liver oil
you went behind my back like bluto when he cut up olive oyl
two things i hate lies and thieves they make my blood boil
boa constricted on my soul that they call

chorus andre

touched by the wheelz of steel
now show me how you feel
touched by the wheelz of steel
now show me how you feel

verse two big boi andre

it took your momma nine months to make it
but it only took a nigga thirty minutes to take it
cut that kronk clean up i did but i did so not safely
dont want no aids *clapping* no claps or no rabies

yo we take no shit like ummm stopped up commodes
gotta collect call they done locked up my folks
low blow hit me in the left ventricle
we wont be able to ride out till two thousand fo

but not for long cuz we got a better sack to serve
tryin to take you other people for your rims at the curb
fore you swerve and bust ya forehead go head go head
more head for me while you ride to the beat

drop like tears like for fears you know
shout shout let it all out just for my peers
and pupils who feel like its time to unwind
like december 31st on nineteen-ninety-nine

chorus

verse three andre

okay like this yeah yeah
one time for my boy doing king shit
two times for legit and it dont quit
three times for my folks in the drop top
four times outkast and it dont stop
one time for my cuz doing queen thangs
dead fresh to the teeth eatin chicken wings
three times for my guhls in the beauty shop
four times outkast and it dont stop

*long interlude chorus again fades*
