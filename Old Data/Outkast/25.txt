everybody gotta eat

from front to back street listen we on a mission
to get right workin street corner in the midnight
picture the scene these fiends with fire
ten dollar dreams scheme for a sack of that believe that

im with whateva like wheatstraw
stuck servin my cocaine raw
stop 62 off the brick jump back
twenty over now thats more money to get

slick we fin to lick on this corner without gettin caught
but time keep a-sleepin and money gettin short
plus that crooked cop brock think we blow sangin fuck him
that why he ride through the hole with the do swingin

but i make moves shake them tricks up they shoestrings
be more precise when we do things
cause life like shakin the dice but i buck back twice
like five deuce fo-trey okay

im strickly dressin dirty dirty
gone represent it to the t-top
born and bred up on the street top
get to the money and the sweet spot
and forever hollerin hootie hoo when we see cops

and forever hollerin hootie hoo when we see cops

shit cops and robbers niggaz be bound to get them dollars and cents
they get in a slump like baseball players when they short on they rent
anything goin you aint knowin how much money you spent
but in the real world you surrounded by these ladies and gents

who hang around you cause you be buyin all the weed and all the chicken
feedin everybody smokin em out when you was broke though they was missin
now you ridin bout fo deep startin to tear up your suspension
and your baby mama on child support my fault forgot to mention

you dont even have a checkin account wasnt thinkin about no pension
i used to work at steak and ale old gold off in the kitchen
had determination and graduated now i got the whole rap world fascinated
i wanted a piece of the pie for me and my family so i made it

but legislation got this new policy three strikes and youre ruined
now where your crew at

and forever hollerin hootie hoo when we see cops

and quit rein-up and standin on this same old block
before our gangsta ass partna get both of us shot

and improvise and work with that little you got

cause people wont forget about the time you gave know what im sayin
and start thinkin bout a path to pave
