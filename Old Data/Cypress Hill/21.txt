so you wanna be a rock superstar and live large
your big house five cars youre in charge
comin up in the world dont trust nobody
gotta look over your shoulder constantly

i remember the days when i was a young kid growin up
lookin in the mirror dreamin about blowin up
the rock crowd make money true with the honeys 
sign autographs or whatever the people want from me
shits funny how impossible dreams manifest
and the games that be comin with it nevertheless
you gotta go for the gusto but you dont know
about the blood sweat and tears and losin some of your peers
and losin some of yourself to the years past gone by
hopefully it dont manifest for the wrong guy
egomaniac in the brainiac dont know how to act
shits deep 48 tracks studio gangsta max
signed the deal thinks hes gonna make a mil
but never will til he crosses over
still fillin your head with fantasies come with me
show the sacrifice it takes to make the gs

so you wanna be a rock superstar in the biz
and take shit from people who dont know what it is
i wish it was all fun and games but the price of fame is high
and some cant pay to play
feel trapped in what you rappin about
tell me what happened when you lost clout
what route you took started collapsin
no fans no fame no respect no change
no women and everybody shits on your name

so you wanna be a rock superstar and live large
your big house five cars youre in charge
comin up in the world dont trust nobody
gotta look over your shoulder constantly
to be a rock superstar and live large
your big house five cars youre in charge
comin up in the world dont trust nobody
gotta look over your shoulder constantly

you ever have big dreams of makin big cream
big shot heavy hitter on the mainstream
you wanna look trendy in the bentley
be a star bam never act friendly
you wanna have big fame let me explain
what happens to these stars and their big brains
first they get played like all damn day
long as you sell everything will be okay
then you get dissed by the media n fans
things never stay the same way they began
i heard that some nigga gave full to the fullest
thats why fools end up dining on the bullet
think everythings fine in the big time
see me in my lace with the chrome ring shine
so you wanna go far and live large
it aint all that goes with bein a rock star

so you wanna be a rock superstar and live large
your big house five cars youre in charge
comin up in the world dont trust nobody
gotta look over your shoulder constantly
to be a rock superstar and live large
your big house five cars youre in charge
comin up in the world dont trust nobody
gotta look over your shoulder constantly

my own son dont know me
im chillin in the hotel room lonely
but i thank god im with my homies
but sometimes i wish i was back home but only
no radio or videos gonna show me
no love theyre phony
gotta hit the road solely so the record gets pushed by sony
im in the middle like mony and the press say that
my own people disown me and the best way back
is to keep your head straight never inflate the cranium
youre too worried about them honeys at the palladium
who just wanna cling on swing on and so forth
go on fall off the whole foot long
to the next rock superstar with no shame
give him a year and theyll be right out the game
the same as the last one who came before him
gained fame started gettin ignored
i warned him assured him
this aint easy take it from wheezy
sleazy people wanna be so cheesy
theyre fuckin evil

so you wanna be a rock superstar and live large
your big house five cars youre in charge
comin up in the world dont trust nobody
gotta look over your shoulder constantly
to be a rock superstar and live large
your big house five cars youre in charge
comin up in the world dont trust nobody
gotta look over your shoulder constantly
