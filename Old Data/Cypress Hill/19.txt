eminem speaking 
most people dont see how much work is really involved 
in this rap shit 
i didnt know it 
i didnt see it 
i never saw it until i was actually in it 
you really gotta be in it 
to understand what its like 
but you always gotta 
people always gotta see your smile 
you always gotta put on that fake 
you know what im sayin 
no matter what u just been through 
shit has gotta be right 

b-real 
so you wanna be a rap superstar 
and live large into a big house 
5 cars youre in charge 
comin up in the world 
dont trust nobody 
gotta look over your shoulder constantly 

b-real 
i remember the days when i was a young kid growin up 
lookin in the mirror dreamin about blowin up 
to rock crowds make money 
chill with the homies 
signing autographs and whatever the people wanted from me 
shits funny 
how impossible dreams manifest in the games that be comin with it 
nevertheless you gotta go for the gusto 
but you dont know about the blood sweat and tears 
and losin some of your peers 
and losin some of yourself 
music has past gone by 
hopefully you wont manifest for the wrong guy 
egomaniac in the brainiac 
dont know how to act 
shits deep 
48 tracks 
studio gangsta mack 
sign a deal emcees wanna make a mill 
but never will 
till he crosses over still 
fillin your head 
with fantasies come with me 
ill show you the sacrifice it takes to make the gs 
you wanna be a rap superstar in the biz 
and take shit from people who dont know what it is 
i wish it was all fun and games 
but the price of fame is high 
and some cant pay the way 
trapped in what you rappin about 
tell me what happened when you lost clout 
the rout you took started collapsing 
no fans 
no fame 
no respect 
no change 
no women 
and everybody shits on your name 

chorus 
so you wanna be a rap superstar 
and live large 
into big house 
5 cars 
the rent charged 
comin up in the world dont trust nobody 
gotta look over your shoulder constantly 
and be a rap superstar 
and live large 
into a big house 
5 cars 
youre in charge 
comin up in the world dont trust nobody 
gotta look over your shoulder constantly 

noreaga speaking 
when you sign to a record label 
you dont know you sign your life over 
and these whiteboys dont care about you 
cuz the minute you fall off 
theyll find another noreaga 
and theyll find another capone-n-noreaga 
and theyll find another b-real 
so you need to just keep 
stack your chips up 
do what you gotta do while your hot 
and madafuckin get out the game 
this isnt like the drug game this is even worse 
because in the drug game if someone jerks you 
you can shoot em and kill em 
but in this game if someone jerks you 
you gotta be noble 

eminem speaking 
no matter what you just been through 
shit has gotta be right 
you gotta approach people 
you gotta be on the up and up 
and everything gotta be all good 
when you see someone slap hands with em 
you know what im sayin give em a pound 
or whatever it is 
but you always gotta act like it aint shit 

chorus 

b-real 
my own son dont know me 
im chillin in a hotel room lonley 
but i thank god im wit my homies 
but sometimes i wish i was back home 
but only no radio or videos 
are gonna show me no love 
the phony gotta hit the road solely 
so the record gets pushed by sony 
im in the middle like monie 
and the press say that 
my own people disowned me 
and the best way back 
is to keep your head straight 
never inflate the cranium 
your crew worried about them homies at the paladium 
who just wanna cling on swing on 
and so on and go on and fall off 
the hoes fall off 
to the next rap superstar 
wit no shame give him a year 
and theyll be right out the game 
the same as the last one 
who came before him 
gained fame 
started gettin ignored 
i warned him 
assured him 
this aint easy take it from weezy 
sleezy people wanna be cheesey 
they are the fuckin evil 

chorus
