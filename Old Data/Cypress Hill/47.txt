let me introduce myself
im the one who rose the cess
so dont you forget
bad rolled ya help
but you still be trying to push buttons 
but you aint nothing no fronting
i bring the level up a little louder
in the clubs in the jeeps in the after hours
fools on the street want to feel the funk
lookin for the skunk thats what you want
ya better sit back and let the track flow
like smoke in your lungs from puffing on the endo
rythems upside ya brain 
can ya hang can ya maintain 
can ya feel the funk flowing in ya veins
get ya fix and a bag of tricks
and the mixer got the stix and stones a few bricks
im gonna hit em high hes gonna hit em low
open up your mind so that you can feel the flow
on and on till there all gone fools be runing
but they wont last long

im the freaker x 8

people always want to get what you got
no matter what 
cant together themselves in the big hunt
in the quest for the crown and the jewels
and the cheese muther f*cker please
and the mees want to plot against me
with envy in there hearts
but i rip there sorry arse apart
in a minute i can take it to the limit
tempreture rising now so highsing

coming back in with the lows
for the fools
f*cking up beakos and any body for fools anybody fools
the number one skunk freaker
a cypress hill beaker the cypress hill sleaker esse
blowing a hole in your speaker
you dont want to test the phero
the real one or the wedo
slanging rythems to the ghetto
ya best keep your arse in check come on
little muther f*uckers that show respect 
and whats next the big brown taking you down and whats next
how you feel when your sorry arse cant hang with the hill with the hill
little punk

im the freaker x4
can you feel the effects of the chocolate ties
nobody even knows how i kick the flow
slow down coz your coming up to fast
you might get smacked down
coz you got no class
no code now im getting down the road
my shits the bomb to explode
take cover you get blown to bits 

fades out
