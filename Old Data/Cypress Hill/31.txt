there comes a time in your life you gotta go for yours
stay invaders like the battle of forever more
i stay pedal to the metal foot on the floor
imma keep on the streets knockin down your doors
im by the dollar like everybody oughtta be
dont burn nobody and make the money honestly
open your home with the internet technology
i get it anyway just by the [] economy
see i aint coughin unless it makes a profit
im droppin it so hot chick like everyday gossip
regardless of the climate im gonna get it every day
even if the bullets spray im gonna get it anyway
