stoned is the way of the walk
stoned is the way of the walk

well its the alley cat puffin on a hootie rat
some think im a criminal but yo i aint all of that
hitcha with the baseball bat an ya wanna ill though

kick it like a steel toe real slow
hits from the bong 
make me feel like cheech 
and im kickin it wit chong
just like cheech &amp; chong frontin with ice cream
cypress hill is here to give you a nice dream
