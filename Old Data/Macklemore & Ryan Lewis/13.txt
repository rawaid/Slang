and i throw it up i throw that up
that’s what it is that’s what it is
in my c a d i l l a c bitch biatch
can’t see me through my tints nah ah
i’m riding real slow slow motion
in my paint wet drippin shorty like my 24’s umbrella
i dont got 24’s no oh
but i’m on those vogues
that’s those big white walls round them hundred spokes
old school like olde english in that brown paper bag
i’m rolling in that same whip that my granddad had
hello haters damn y’all mad
30k on the caddy now how backpack rap is that

hollis
got that off-black cadillac midnight drive
got that gas pedal leaning back taking my time
i’m blowin’ that roof off letting in sky
i shine the city never looked so bright

man i’m lounging in some shit bernie mac would’ve been proud of
looking down from heaven like damn that’s stylish
smilin’ don’t pay attention to the mileage
can i hit the freeway i’m illegally going 120
easy weaving in and out of the traffic
they cannot catch me i’m smashing
i’m ducking bucking them out here
i’m lookin fuckin fantastic i am up in a classic
now i know what it’s like under the city lights
riding into the night driving over the bridge
the same one we walked across as kids
knew i’d have a whip but never one like this
old school old school candy paint two seater
yea i’m from seattle there’s hella honda civics
i couldn’t tell you about paint either
but i really want the caddy so i put in the hours
and roll on over to the dealer
and i found the car im dreaming of as i bargain with this geezer
got the keys in and as i was leaving i started screaming

white hoes in the backseat snorting coke
she doing line after line like she’s writing rhymes
i had it hella my love tryna blow her mind
cadillac pimpin’ my uncle was on
14 years out so excuse me and my niggas was gone
sendin’ portions of his liquor water in the patrón
rather smiling like i won the fucking lottery homes
fuckin lottery homes
tires with the spokes on it and the vogues too
mustard and mayonnaise keeping the buns on ‘em
my dogs hanging out the window
young as whoosh fuckin like we ball
tryna fuck em all kill the fuckin wimps
see what’s poppin’ at the mall meet a bad bitch
slap her booty with my palms
you can smoke the pussy i was tearing down the walls
i’m motherfuckin’ awesome
swear these eyes tryna hypnotize
grip the leather steering wheel while i grip the thighs
see the lust stuck up in her eyes
maybe she like the ride or did she like the smoke
girl does she want it low
this shit a coupe de ville so you’ll never know
so we cruise for minutes my nigga fuck the limit
got a window tinted for showing gangstas in it
slide till the gas is finished q
