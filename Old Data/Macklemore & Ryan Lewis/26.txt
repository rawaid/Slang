everything is gold everything is equal
posted on the porch just chillin me and my people
eyelids closed gold sun shines on
the world’s coated in the gold krylon
yea and these days days days
they never run away
gold tints shades that block out that golden haze
take all the gold from the pawnshop that lives behind the case
and get to give it away
my gold erupted from volcanos in the heavens
and every shrine that existed in time melting
tombs open dookie ropes on the bells
when everything is gold who cares about the carats
they say that golds the skin of the gods
you can’t take the band there when you’re gone
now i’ll tip over that kiosk in the mall
as the sunset falls into tomorrow

today we’re feeling like gold five hundred thousand sold
slick rick gold row fun hella cold
and we stay fresh so fresh head to toes
ghost slowly faded 14 carat plated
so we’re feeling like gold

five hundred thousand sold
slick rick gold row fun hella cold
today we’re feeling like gold
so fresh head to toes
ghost slowly faded 14 carat plated
so we’re feeling like gold

alright now we open up that car door
hop out hope they notice us
throughout society we been locked in that cobra clutch
more gold bottles gold bottles never sober up
ditch jesus in gold i trust
i solemnly swear to wear my cross and stunt
separate myself by sticking out just because
that’s how you illustrate power and who you’re above
but nah tonight we take it take it giving it back
crack open the vault let everyone mob in the bank
take whatever they want we party and give thanks
ive been rocking gold chains since pee was in the tank
you only live once you only live once
watch rick ross give his jesus piece to a bum
cause tonight we ball we ball we comin’ up
paintin the globe gold two steppin’ on the sun

like gold five hundred thousand sold
slick rick gold row fun hella cold
and we stay fresh so fresh head to toe
ghost slowly faded 14 carat plated
so we’re feeling like gold

oh oh oh oh oh

gold coins gold phone gold car
costs at least 10 racks to get 16 gold bars
gold rush suck on my gold dust stuntin
under these gold trunks that’s 2 golden nugget
flyin on the gold eagle flier than the rest of ‘em
passing space needle golden shower on pedestrians
excuse me that’s my bad that’s my eagle and he shouldn’t of
my eagle got hair that motherfucker got a mullet bruh
and it’s gold two girls gold brass
lounging on the water feet in the gold sand
sipping on orangina arms around them both pants
they’re sipping olde english right out of a gold can
two girls gold spandex so pretty
that girl ain’t even gold she just got golden girl titties
i’m kidding everyone is gold in my city
you paint betty white gold even betty white can get it
get it get it get it

today we’re feeling like gold five hundred thousand sold
