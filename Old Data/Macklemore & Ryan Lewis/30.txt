i need love
you need love
give me love
and ill give you my love

they say thirty is the new twenty
and twenty is the new thirty shit i guess
makes sense cause fifteen year olds seem twenty
and twenty five year olds seem ten
i used to drink away my paycheck
celebrate the mistakes i hadnt made yet
our generation isnt the best on safe sex
we forget the latex becoming planned parenthood patients
synthetic heroin is the new basshead
so much to escape fuck a straight edge
walk around looking through a fake lens
apps this good whose got time to make friends
i wish i didnt care
acynical hispters with long hair
cocaine problems like my music
its not my issue i cant solve it

my flight has finally landed down
and the ground has stopped moving all around
eyes open awake for the very first time
we both forfeit this game of crime

they say its so refreshing to hear somebody on records
no guns no drugs no sex just truth
the guns thats america the drugs are what they gave to us
and sex sells itself dont judge her til its you
ah im not more or less cautious
the rappers rappin bout them strippers up on the pole copping
these interviews are obnoxious
saying that its poetry is so well spoken stop it
i grew up during reaganomics
when ice t was out there on his killing cops shit
or rodney king was getting beat on
and they let off every single officer
and los angeles went and lost it
now every month there is a new rodney on youtube
its just something our generation is used to
and neighbourhoods where you never see a news crew
unless theyre gentrifying white people dont even cruise through
and my subconcious telling me stop it
this is an issue that you shouldnt get involved in
dont even tweet rip trayvon martin
dont wanna be that white dude million man marchin
fighting for our freedom that my people stole
dont wanna make all my white fans uncomfortable
but you dont even have a fuckin song for radio
why you out here talkin race tryin to save the fuckin globe
dont get involved with the causes in mind
white privilege white guilt at the same damn time
so we just party like its nineteen ninty nine
celebrate the ignorance while these kids keep dying

my flight has finally landed down
and the ground has stopped moving all around
eyes open awake for the very first time
we both forfeit this game of crime
