alright okay
alright okay
alright okay

return of the mack get up
what it is what it does what it is what it isnt
looking for a better way to get up out of bed
instead of getting on the internet and checking a new hit

we get up fresh out pimp strut walking
little bit of humble little bit of cautious
somewhere between like rocky and cosby sweater gang
nope nope yall cant copy

yup bad moonwalkin this here is our party
my posses been on broadway and we did it our way
grown music
i shed my skin and put my bones into everything i record to it
and yet im on

let that stage light go and shine on down
got the bob barker suit game and plinko in my style
money stay on my craft and stick around for those pounds
but i do that to pass the torch and put on for my town

trust me im a i-n-d-e-p-e-n-d-e-n-t shit hustler
chasing dreams since i was fourteen
with the four track busing halfway cross that city with the backpack
fat cat crushin labels out here

nah they cant tell me nothing we give that to the people
spread it across the country labels out here
nah they cant tell me nothing we give it to the people
spread it across the country

can we go back this is the moment
tonight is the night well fight till its over
so we put our hands up like the ceiling cant hold us
like the ceiling cant hold us

can we go back this is the moment
tonight is the night well fight till its over
so we put our hands up like the ceiling cant hold us
like the ceiling cant hold us

now can i kick it thank you
yeah im so damn grateful
i grew up really wanting gold fronts
but thats what you get when wu-tang raised you

yall cant stop me
i go hard like ive got an 808 in my heartbeat
and im eating at the beat
like you gave a little speed to a great white shark on shark week

raw time to go off gone deuces goodbye
ive got a world to see;
and my girl she wanna see rome
caesarll make you a believer
nah i never ever did it for a throne
that validation comes
so im giving it back to the people now
sing that song and it goes like

raise those hands this is our party
we came here to live life like nobody was watching
i got my city right behind me
if i fall they got me
learn from that failure gain humility
and then we keep marching i said

can we go back this is the moment
tonight is the night well fight till its over
so we put our hands up like the ceiling cant hold us
like the ceiling cant hold us

can we go back this is the moment
tonight is the night well fight till its over
so we put our hands up like the ceiling cant hold us
like the ceiling cant hold us

and so we put our hands up
and so we put our hands up
oh oh oh

hey and all my people say
na na nana na nana na
hey and all my people say
na na nana na nana na
oh and all my people say

can we go back this is the moment
tonight is the night well fight till its over
so we put our hands up like the ceiling cant hold us
like the ceiling cant hold us

can we go back this is the moment
tonight is the night well fight till its over
so we put our hands up like the ceiling cant hold us
like the ceiling cant hold us
