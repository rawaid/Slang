i used to sit with my dad in the garage
that sawdust that pine sol and the moss
around every spring when the winter thaw
wed huddle around the radio twist the broken knob
710 am no kjr dave niehaus voice would echo throughout the yard
couldnt have been older than 10
but to me and my friends
the voice on the other end might as well have been gods
1995 the division series
edgars up to bat
bottom of the 11th inning got the whole town listening
swung on and belted the words that started joey cora rounds third
here comes griffey the throw to the plates not in time
my oh my the mariners win it
yes fire works they lit up ceiling in the king dome
we had just made history

[dave niehaus announcing]
and swung lined down the left field line for a base hit
here comes joey here comes junior to third base
theyre gonna wave him in the throw to the plate will be
late the mariners are going to play for the american league championship
i dont believe it it just continues my oh my

laces woven barley holdin that stitch
the creases are time amongst the grime and the grit
where the leather he used to pound his fists
to some its just a mitt but see that glove was him
yep tell me stories on the field with that sun stained brim
blood under my chin he taught me how to spit
sunflower seeds back when me and my crew sun burnt arms
big league chew yeah we were like the sand lot after dinner
after practice we listen to the ms in the kitchen
and if mom wasnt trippin come on dad please i swear just one more inning
voice went pump pump through the system break out the rye bread its grand salami time
my oh my another victory yes my city my city
childhood my life watchin griffey right under those lights

under that light rain gleaming in that night came cant stop now
keep moving no break pads came here to prove a point live my life on the field
make history in between the base path
and compete against the fear that is in me thats my only barrier and i swear im going to break that
from the mud the cleats that we drug threw the feet this is that moment and you cannot take it back
and i dont really collect cards anymore just a box and some old card board
memories embedded in the dust in the fighters that age just like us livin some where off in the drawer
this is what you make of it yeah we play to win
live it like were under the lights of the stadium fight until the day that god decided to wave us in
right until he waves us in
its my city my city childhood my life thats right right under those lights
my city my city childhood thats right niehaus
my oh my come on my city my city childhood my life thats right under those lights
its my city my city childhood my life niehaus my oh my rest in peace
