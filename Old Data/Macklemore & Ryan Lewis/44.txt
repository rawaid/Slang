oh girl this boat is sinking
theres no sea left for me
and how the sky gets heavy
when you are underneath it
oh i want to sail away from here
and god he came down
and saidnothing

he rolled up asked him what he was sippin on
he said lean you want to hit it dawg
thats the same stuff weezys sippin huh
and tons of other rappers that be spittin hard
yup yup five a bone
when he passed him that styrofoam
the easter pink heard it in a rhyme before
finally got to see what all the hype was on
and then he took a sip sittin in the lincoln
thinkin he was pimpin as he listened to the system
little did he know that it was just as addictive as bass
not the kind of hit from the kick drum
hot box let the bass bump
take it to the face gulp
months later the use went up
every blunt was accompanied by the pink stuff
but goddamn he loved that feelin
purple rain coated in the throat
just so healin
medicine alleviate the sickness
liquid to fix and it comes with a cost
wake up cold sweat scratchin itchin
trying to escape the skin that barely fit him
gone get another bottle just to get a couple swallows
headed towards the bottom couldnt get off it
didnt even think he had a problem
though he couldnt sleep without gettin nauseous
room spinnin thinkin he mightve sipped just a little bit too much of that cough syrup
his eyelids closed shut
sat back in the chair clutchin that cup
girlfriend came and a couple hours later said his name shook him but he never got up

he never got up he never got up
we live on the cusp of death thinkin that it wont be us
it wont be us it wont be us it wont be us
nah it wont be us

oh girl this boat is sinking
theres no sea left for me
and how the sky gets heavy
when you are underneath it
oh i want to sail away from here
and godcame down
and saidnothing

[macklemore]
now he just wanted to act like them
he just wanted to rap like him
us as rappers underestimate the power and the effects that we have on these kids
blunt passed ash in a tin pack being pushed harassed by the feds
the fact of it is most people that rap like this talkin about some shit they havent lived
surprise you know the drill
trapped in a box to climb record sales
follow the formula violence drugs and sex sells
so we try to sound like someone else
this is not californication
theres no way to glorify this pavement
syrup percocet and an eighth a day will leave you broke depressed and emotionally vacant
despite how lil wayne lives
its not conducive to being creative
and i know cause hes my favorite
and i know cause i was off that same mix
rationalize the shit that id try after i listen to dedication
but hes an alien id sip that shit pass out or play playstation
months later im in the same place
no music made feeling like a failure
and trust me its not dope to be 25 and move back to your parents basement
ive seen my peoples dreams die
ive seen what they can be denied
and weeds not a drug - thats denial
groundhog day life repeat each time
ive seen oxycotin take three lives
i grew up with them we used to cheef dimes
ive seen cocaine bring out the demons inside
cheatin and lyin
friendship cease no peace in the mind
stealin and takin anything to fix the pieces inside
broken hopeless headed nowhere
only motivation for what the dealers supplying
that rush that drug that dope
those pills that crumb that roach
thinkin i would never do that not that drug
growing up nobody ever does
until youre stuck lookin in the mirror like i cant believe what ive become
swore i was goin to be someone
and growing up everyone always does
we sell our dreams and our potential
to escape through that buzz
just keep me up keep me up
hollywood here we come

oh girl this boat is sinking
theres no sea left for me
and how the sky gets heavy
when you are underneath it
oh i want to sail away from here
and godhe came down
and saidnothing
