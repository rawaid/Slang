i put my life on the line
i roll them dice and im fine
cause all i ever dreamt about was makin it
they aint giving it im taking it

im taking it taking it
they aint giving it im taking it taking it
they aint giving it im taking it taking it
they aint giving it im taking it taking it
i need all that shit

steal myself a record deal
steal myself a record deal
steal myself a record deal
steal myself a record deal

macklemore
if i just went in and stole it the police wouldve noticed
gotta be strategic creepin go in leave with that motive
hold up my plan is forming; all right casin this building
watch these rappers that rappin walk in and leave out with millions millions
headed in sweating open that front door
interscope printed out right by the entrance
door closes not a metaphor then i start towards
that front thats right where you check in
dressed in an uniform acting like a janitor
all blue jumpsuit why shoot
bloodthirsty for the money like a bull
looking in the eyes of the matador fuck you
carrying 2 cans of paint; security looks at me awkward
i say third floor im late; paintin jimmy iovines office
holding my breath bout to faint
im scared to death that he stops me
heart beating so loud that you can hear the echo in that lobby
and see im breaking down; if i dont make it out
then im leaving town with that contract
and im spazzing out cover the in or out
loose chair and im taking him hostage
i dont give a fuck step into the elevator press three
now im headed up heist
what they dont know theres a gun in the paint can
and im ready and willing to bust ‘em im fucking desperate
stuck in this recession now what you think
but if i could get signed my life is destined
my future depends on ink
a secretary at the front of the entrance staring right at me
i walk up; she whispers go ahead and then gives me a wink

if i get past security the secretary the cubicals
but its weird its like this room ive walked into is unusual
thought it would be shiny and beautiful
thought it would be alive and like musical
but it feels like someone died; its got the vibe of a funeral
theres numbers on a chalkboard
cds boxed in cardboard
artists that flopped that got dropped and never got to be sophomores

graphic designers are sitting around
waiting for albums that never come out
complainin that they have nobody in house
wonderin what they make art for
i start thinking am i in the right place
just walk forward see plaques on the wall
oh yea in a second those will be all yours

finally see an office with a mounted sign heaven sent
big block silver letters read it out loud president heist
this was my chance to grab that contract and turn and jet
right then felt a cold hand grabbin the back of my neck

he said weve been watching you so glad you could make it
your music its so impressive and this whole brand you created
youre one hell of a band; we here think youre destined for greatness
and with that right song we all know that youre next to be famous

now im sorry ive had a long day; remind me now what your name is
thats right macklemore of course today has been crazy
anyway you ready well give you a hundred thousand dollars
after your album comes out well need back that money that you borrowed

so its really like a loan
a loan come on no
were a team 360 degrees; we will reach your goals
youll get a third of the merch that you sell out on the road
along with a third of the money you make when youre out doing your shows
manager gets 20 booking agent gets 10 so shit
after taxes you and ryan have 7% to split
thats not bad; ive seen a lot worse
no one will give you a better offer than us
i replied i appreciate the offer; thought that this is what i wanted
rather be a starving artist than succeed at getting fucked
