and they say dont forget where you come from
dont die holding on to your words
cause you know you got a whole world to change
but understand who you got to change first

and i was like fuck that humility bust back
i remember the days with nothing but a bus pass
i was just a little shorty hoping that i could find a bum to buy a 40 for me
and have enough for a bud sack
yeah and i dance on that instrumental
unorthodox like basquiat with the pencil
give me a microphone and a beat box i could vent to
music the only medium that i could find myself through
recluse sipping on some lean i would let loose
looking in the mirror watching myself lose
cleaned up in 08 got a job making barely minimum wage
to get into that page
hit the road with rl performing in front of 8 people
and that shit will check your ego
about around that time im watching that ep go
from nothing to getting us booked around the country
i know no limits life can change in an instant
8 people turn into sold out shows in a minute
and im watching my pops in the back row grinning
with his glass up to my mom toasting this guinness

and we on we on
good music it lies in the ambiance
when we leave here
will these words live on
till then we keep on making the songs

so put em up up up up up so high
so put em up up up up up so high
so put em up up up up up so high
put em up up up up up so high
so put em up up up up up so high
so put em up up up up up so high

i remember that freshman edition
last year thinking to myself like
yah nah i wont win it yet
probably wont get it but im gonna give it everything
play my position
the next 11 months i gave it all everything i had left in me
left blood sweat tears in every god damn city
no label no deal no publicist indie
just music that connected and fans that rode with me
throw me a gold mine and a co-sign
while youre riding a couple dope rides
2 women both dimes
not gonna lie that shit sounds so nice
but i got creative control and my souls mine
i wouldnt trade it maybe im crazy
i put on for my city
seattle that raised me
rule 4080 its really not changing
now a days make good music the people are your label

so put em up up up up up so high
so put em up up up up up so high
so put em up up up up up so high
put em up up up up up so high
so put em up up up up up so high
so put em up up up up up so high

oh my god feels like a victory lap
can i have that moment
can i talk my shit

and they say dont forget where you come from
dont die holding on to your words
cause you know you got a whole world to change
but understand who you got to change first

put em up up up up up
up up up up up
up up up up up
