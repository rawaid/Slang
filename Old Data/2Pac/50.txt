what yall want
unconditional love no doubt
talking bout the stuff that dont wear off
it dont fade
itll last for all these crazy days
these crazy nights
whether you wrong or you right
im guna still love you
still feel you
still there for you
no matter what hehe
you will always be in my heart
with unconditional love

verse one

come listen to my truest thoughts my truest feelings
all my peers doing years beyond drug dealing
how many caskets can we witness
before we see its hard to live this life without god so we must ask forgiveness
ask mama why god deserved to die
witness the tears falling free from my eyes before she could reply
though we were born without a silver spoon
my broken down tv show cartoons in my living room hey
one day i hope to make it a player in this game
mama dont cry long as we try maybe things change
perhaps its just a fantasy
a life where we dont need no welfare shit with our whole family
maybe its me that caused it the fighting and the hurting
in my room crying cause i didnt want to be a burden
watch mama open up her arms to hug me
and i aint worried bout a damn thang with unconditional love

chorus 2x
in this game the lessons in your eyes to see
though things change the futures still inside of me
we must remember that tomorrow comes after the dark
so you will always be in my heart with unconditional love

verse two

just got the message youve been calling all week
been out here hustling on these streets aint had a chance to speak
but you know with you and me its on g
we could never be enemies cause you been such a good friend to me
where would i be without my dogs
no wonder why when times get hard cause it aint easy being who we are
driven by my ambitions desire higher positions
so i proceed to make gs eternally in my mission
is to be more than just a rap musician 
the elevation of todays generation if could make em listen
prison aint what we need no longer stuck in greed
time to play and strategize my familys gotta eat
when we make somethin out of nothing no pleasure in the suffering
neighborhood would be good if they could cut out all the busting
the liquor and the weed the cussing sending love out to my block
the struggle never stops unconditional love

chorus 2x
in this game the lessons in your eyes to see
though things change the futures still inside of me
we must remember that tomorrow comes after the dark
so you will always be in my heart with unconditional love

verse three

ill probably never understand ya ways 
with everyday i swear i hear ya
trying to change your ways while gettin paid at the same time
just had a baby with the same eyes 
something inside please let me die these are strange times
how come i never made it
maybe its the way the played it in my heart
i knew one day i gotta be a star
my hopes and all my wishes
so many vivid pictures and all the currency ill never even get to see
this fast life soon shatter us 
cause after all the lights and screams nothing but my dreams matter
hoping for better days maybe a peaceful night
baby dont cry cause everythang gonna be alright
just lay your head on my shoulder
dont worry bout a thang baby girl im a soldier huh
never treated me bad no matter who i was
you still came with that unconditional love

chorus 3x until fade
in this game the lessons in your eyes to see
though things change the futures still inside of me
we must remember that tomorrow comes after the dark
so you will always be in my heart with unconditional love
