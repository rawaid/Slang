i wanna dedicate this one to robert yummy sanderford
and all other lil young niggaz thats in a rush to be gangstas

as a young nigga im almost swellin in the wind
give anythang to be that innocent again when i was ten
i didnt bang but i was hangin with the homies
tell them niggaz started slangin that they dont know me
i got my hustle on learned to ignore what couldnt pay me
lately ive been tryin to make a bill-ion can you play me
with that jealousy they need to miss me dont sweat me
if them cowards really want me come get me and even i
someday will die but im cautious im fin to ride
put down the top now we flossin
hit the freeway let the wind blow drop the window
workin with a twenty sack of indo feelin good
stop through the hood grab the young thugs
and i cant help but reminisce back when we slung drugs know its bad
but all we had was our hopes and dreams
couldnt see unless we learned to slang dope to fiends
as young niggaz

hes the kind of g like everybody knows
as a young nigga
hes always gd up from head to toe
my memories as a young nigga
always got it blown like al capone
young nigga
hes the downest g ive ever known

back in junior high when we was barely gettin by when daddy died
thats when my momma started gettin high
my neighborhood was full of drivebys couldnt survive
all our homies livin short lives i couldnt cry
told my momma if i did die just put a blunt in my casket
let me get my dead homies high
come follow me throughout my history its just
me against the world stuck in misery; as a young nigga
my only thing was to be paid
life full of riches avoid snitched cause they shady back in the days
we always found the time to play
but thats before they taught them gangbangers how to spray
not just la but in the bay and in chicago and even st louis
every stadium that i go when will they change
stuck in the game like a dumb nigga
remember how it was to be a young nigga

hes the kind of g like everybody knows
as a young nigga
hes always gd up from head to toe
my memories as a young nigga
always got it blown like al capone
young nigga
hes the downest g ive ever known

im tellin you
 to be young have your brains and have everyÂ  and all that
yo yall niggaz dont know how good you really do got it
muhfuckers need to just calm down
and peep what the fuck they wanna do for the rest of the life
fore you end your life before you begin your life
you dumb nigga

now that im grown i got my mind on bein somethin
dont wanna be another statistic out here doin nuttin
tryin to maintain in this dirty game keep it real
and i will even if it kills me my young niggaz
break away from these dumb niggaz
put down the guns and have some fun nigga the restll come nigga
fame is a fast thang that gangbangin
puttin niggaz in a casket murdered for hangin
at the wrong place at the wrong time no longer livin
cause he threw up the wrong sign and every day
i watch the murder rate increases and even worse
the epidemic and diseases what is the future
the projects lookin hopeless where
more and more brothers givin up and dont care
sometimes i hate when brothers act up i hit the weed
and i proceed to blow the track up for young niggaz

hes the kind of g like everybody knows
for these young niggaz
hes always gd up from head to toe
my memories as a young nigga
he always got it blown like al capone
take it slow nigga its for the young niggaz
hes the downest g ive ever known
as a young nigga

hes the kind of g like everybody knows
hes always gd up from head to toe
memories as a young nigga
he always got it blown like al capone
hes the downest g ive ever known

pac talking overlaps singing last four lines
