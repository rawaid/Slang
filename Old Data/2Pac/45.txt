i just dont give a fuck
they done push me to the limit im all in
i might blow up any minute did it again
now im in the back of the paddy wagon
while this cops bragging about the nigga hes baggin
i see no justice
all i see is niggas dying fast
the sound of a gun blast
then watchin the hearse pass
just another day in the life g
gotta step lightly cuz cops tried to snipe me
the catch they dont wanna stop at the brother man
but then theyll have an accident and pick up another man
i went to the bank to cash my cheque
i get more respect from the mutha-fuckin dope man
the grammys and the american music shows pimp us like hos
they got dough but they hate us though
you better keep your mind on the real shit
and fuck trying to get with these crooked ass hypocrites
they way they see it we was meant to be keep down
just cant understand why we getting respect now
mama told me theyre be days like this
but im pissed cause it stays like this
and now they trying to send me off to kuwait
gimme a break
how much shit can a nigga take
i aint goin nowhere no how
what you wanna throw down
better bring your guns pal
cuz this is the day we make em pay
fuck bailin hate i bail and spray with an a-k
and even if they shoot me down
therell be another nigga bigger
from the mutha-fuckin underground
so step but you better step quick
cause the clocks goin tick and im sick of the bullshit
youre watching the makings of a phychopath
the truth didnt last
before the wrath and aftermath
whos that behind the trigger
whod do yah figure
a mutha-fuckin night nigga
ready to buck and rip shit up
i had enough and i just dont give a fuck

niggas isnt just the blacks
also a gang of mutha-fuckas dressed in blue slacks
they say niggas hang in packs and their attitude is shitty
tell me whos the biggest gang of niggas in the city
they say niggas like to do niggas
throw me in the cuffs with just two niggas
a street walkin nigga and a beat walkin nigga with a badge
i had to shoot ya and the pass for the blast take his cash
and bash his head in dump him at the dead in
and thats just his luck
cause a nigga like me
dont really give a fuck

walked in the store whats everybody staring at
they act like they never seen a muthafucka wearing black
following a nigga and shit
aint this a bitch
all i wanted was some chips
i wanna take my business elsewhere
but where
cause who in the hell cares
about a black man with a black need
they wanna jack me like some kind of crack fiend
i wonder if knows that my income is more than
his pension salary and then some
your daughter is my number one fan
and your jive ass wife wants a life with a black man
so whos the mac in fact whos the black jack
sit back and get fat off the fat cat
while he thinks that hes getting over
i bust a move as smooth as casanova
and count another quick meal
im getting paid for my traid but its still real
and if you look between the lines youll find a rhyme
as strong as a fuckin nine
mail stacked up niggas wanna act up
lets put the gats up and throw your backs up
but the cops getting dropped by the gun shot
useta come but hes done now we run the block
to my brothers stay strong keep yah heads up
they know we fed up
