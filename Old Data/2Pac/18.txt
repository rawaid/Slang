so grab one by the hand youknowhatimsayin
and uhh throw up that finger
ay yo yo yo throw yall fingers up
thug style baby thug style yknow

verse one

tell me baby are you lonely dont wanna rush ya
i can help ya if ya only let me touch ya
if im wrong love tell me cause i get caught up
and the life i live is hell see i never thought id see
the day when i would calm down you aint heard
ive been known to clown and get around thats my word
see you walkin and you lookin good yes indeed
got a body like a sex fiend youre killin me
witcha attitude to match right dont be phony
cause i hate when you act like you dont know me
ive be stressin in the spotlight i want the fame
but the industrys a lot like a crack game
aint no time for commitment i gotta go
cant be wit you every minute miss another show
and even though im known for my one night stand
look here i wanna be an honest man but temptations go

heyyyy heyy-ayyaahhyy 

throw up the finger
and all my homies go
give them the finger
ya know what baby its like

*singing*
i know youve been searchin for someone
to make you happy and get the job done
you say you need it a man with money
but i cant be there and will you still care

verse two

will i cheat or will i be committed heaven knows
gettin weak and i wanna hit it so here i go
in my ride and im all in gettin high
i can hear the people callin im passin by
everybody knows im ball-in and to god
gotta keep myself from fall-in but its hard
all the cuties know im under pressure what do i do
gettin shaky when she pull the dress up and say its cool
should i stroke or should i wait a while you decide
if you tell me that you dont want it thats a lie
move close and let me whisper some dirty words
in your ears as i kiss ya on every curve
slow down baby dont rush i like it slow
cant hold it any longer so let it go
open the gates do you wanna fall up in heaven
dont worry i let myself in all i heard was

heyyyy heyy-ayyaahhyy

give em the finger
all my homies go
throw your fingers up
thats just the thug in me girl you know
peep out all my homies yknow its like

*singing*
i know youve been searchin for someone
to make you happy and get the job done
you say you need it a man with money
but i cant be there and will you still care

verse three

a lot of people think its easy to settle down
got a woman thatll please me in every town
i dont wanna but i gotta do it the temptation
got me ready to release the fluid sensation
sit down and conversate like you know me take my hand
cause even thugs get lonely understand
even the hardest of my homies need attention
catch you blowin up the telephone reminiscin
i wanna take you to the movies and the park
lets find a spot for you to do me in the dark
now that its passion hold me tight
dont need lights i can see you by the moonlight
i know your man aint lovin you right
youre lonely and depressed you need a thug in your life
enough talkin you want me to leave ill get to walkin
see you later cause baby im a player and all i heard was

heyyyy heyy-ayyaahhyy

give em the finger
and all my homies go 
yo this how we gonna do this in the nine-trey yknow
throw your fingers up

they gonna peep this this how we run game on you

*singing*
