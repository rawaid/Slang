verse one 
he was a nice middle class nigga
but nobody knew the evil hed do when he got a little bigger
get off the final blaze 
while puffing on a newport
plottin on a another way to catch a case
was only sixteen yet convicted as a felon
with a bunch of old niggas 
but you the only one who aint telling
i tell you its a cold world stay in school
you tell me its a mans world play the rules
and fade fools n break rules until we major
blaze up getting with hoes through my pager
was raised up commencing to money makin tactics
its getting drastic niggas got automatics
my fingers on the trigga tell the lord
to make way for another straight thug nigga
im sitting getting buzzed looking for some luv
from the homies cuz shorty wanna be a thug

chorus

verse two 
straight from the hall to the penn
adolescent nigga scaling weight and standing six feet ten
he carried weight like a mack truck
gonna bust on some playa haters 
if the mutha fuckas act tuff
then thats when the lethal weapon with the razor
this little nigga smoking weed and getting blazed up
no one could figure when the guns blast pull the trigga
could take the life of a young nigga guns bigger
no mother and father you see the niggas all alone
old timers my role model the war zone
released with this game til its a part of me
my heart dont beat no fear and it aint hard to see
the future is looking dim
im trying to make a profit out of living in this sin
im in the dark getting buzzed looking for some love
out with the homies cuz shorty wanna be a thug

chorus

outro 
shorty gonna be a thug

you little bad ass nigga to the young niggas
gotta stay sharp nigga play your part
you got plenty of time you bad mutha fuckas
you only get three mistakes then thats life big baby niggas craaazy
watch the signs
damn you aint but sixteen nigga
