intro george clinton

the blind stares
of a million pairs of eyes
lookin hard but wont realize
that they will never see
the p

you must be goin blind

verse one 2pac

give me my money in stacks
and lace my bitches with 9 figures
real niggas fingers on nickle plated 9 triggas
must see my enemies defeated
im cashin
while they coughed up and weeded
open fire
now them niggas bleedin
see me in flesh
and test
and get your chest blown
straight out tha west dont get blown
my adversaries cry like hos
open and shut like doors
is you a friend or foe 
nigga you aint know 
they got me stressed out on death row
ive seen money
but baby i got to gets mo
you scream and go
2pac
and i aint stopin
till im well paid
bails paid
now nigga look what hell made
visions of cops and sirens
niggas open fire
buncha thug life niggas on tha rise
until i die
ask me why im a boss playa gettin high
and when im rollin by
niggas cant c me

chorus george clinton

the stares of a million pairs of eyes
and youll never realize
you cant c me

verse two 2pac

been getten worried that
these square muthafuckers with nerves
sayin they can get with us
but picture me gettin served
my own mama say im thuged out
my shit be bumpin out tha record store
as if it was a drug house
my lyrics bang like a crip or blood
nigga what 
it aint nothin but a party when we thug
and there i was
a young nigga with heart
aint had shit to loose
pullin my pistol on them fools
you know the rules
d-r-e you got me heated
my words like a penatentary dick
hittin bitches where its most needed
money and weed
alazay and hennesse
to my thug niggas in lock down

when my album hit tha streetz

chorus george clinton

verse three 2pac

you niggas made a mistake
