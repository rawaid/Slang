a state thats untouchable like eliot ness
the track hits your eardrum like a slug to your chest
pack a vest for your jimmy in the city of sex

we in that sunshine state with a bomb-ass hemp beat
the state where you never find a dance floor empty
and pimps be on a mission for them greens
lean mean money-making machines serving fiends

i been in the game for ten years making rap tunes
ever since honeys was wearing sassoon
now its 95 and they clock me and watch me
diamonds shining; looking like i robbed liberace
