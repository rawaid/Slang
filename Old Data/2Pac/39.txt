good evening sirens in the background
im reporting live from sunset boulevard
where many excited fans have gathered with candles
crowd starts chanting tupac
awaiting the much anticipated release of tupac shakurs latest album better dayz
this is yet another post-humorous release by tupac
which raises the question
where are these songs coming from
its interesting how the message in these songs
is still relevant today
even in his death hes touching people with his lyrics
i can feel the energy in the air as they count down to midnight
when the album will officially be released
oh hold on i think theyre starting to countdown now
