a military mind nigga
a military mind mean money
a criminal grind nigga
a criminal grind mean hustle
you know

we tradin war stories
we outlaws on the rise
jealous niggas i despise
look in my eyes 2x

now can your mind picture
a thug nigga drinkin hard liquor
this ghetto life has got me catchin up to god quicker
who would figure that all i need was a
hair trigga semi-automatic mac-11 just to scare niggas
pardon my thug poetry
but suckers is born everyday and fear of man grow on trees
criminal ties for centuries
a legend in my own rhymes
so niggas wishful when they mention
makaveli was my tutor and donald goines
my father figure
mama sent me to go play with the drug dealers
henceforth
we thug niggas and we came in packs
every one of niggas strapped sippin on naccognac
in the back my ar 15
thuggin till i die
these streets got me cravin thorazine
my lyrics are blueprints to money makin
fat as that ass that honeys shakin

repeat chorus 2x

i must stay thuggin and shit
they call it overthuggin and shit
but i was just a younger nigga gettin older and lovin this shit
but what was i doin in this place
to the fakes without a pistol in the first
facin termination in the worst
but i figured to play the war
to watch all these playa hatin niggas position
for i could see em all
made it up out of there
lucky to be here
to tell you but itll never be a repeat
people im tryin to tell you

this game something deeper

chorus repeats 2x

i starts em off with this gansta raw story tale
stackin loot up in the coup that i protect with a mack 12
slap my clip in the chamber

i be the nigga pullin the trigga and
dumpin the hollow points in your brain

chorus repeats 2x

mama had me lived and raised on shit that aint ok
aint nuttin on this earth will make a nigga like me stay
