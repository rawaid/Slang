verse one daz

you find an mc like me whos strong
leavin motherfuckers aborted with no verbal support
and when i command the microphone i gets deadly as kahn though
with a bear and a snake and a panda im on those 
who can withstand the mo power i gain
and make it possible for me to drop a few to wreck ya brain
imagine and keep on wishin upon a star
finally realizing who the fuck we are
when i penetrate its been withstandin faded
would it be the greatest mc of all time
when i created rhyme for the simple fact
when i attack i crush your pride
my intention to ride every time all night
im faced with the scars beyond this one bar
for me to put down my guard im faced witha mirage
breakin in gas with the six-eight all day
in and out with my pay
im soon to count the bodies

verse two tupac

so mandatory my elevation my lyrics like orientation
so you can be more familiar with tha nigga you facin
we must be based on nothin better than communication
known to damage and highly flamable like gas stations
sorry i left that ass waitin
no more procrastination give up to fate and get that ass shakin
im bustin and makin motherfuckers panic
dont take ya life for granted put that ass in the dirt
you swear the bitches planned it
my lyrics motivate the planet
its similar to rhythm nation
but thugged out forgive me janet
whos in control im acvtivatin your soul
you know the way the games gettin sold
yo two years ago a friend of mine
told me alize and cristal blows your mind
bear witness to the dopest fuckin rhyme i wrote
takin off my coat clearing my throat

chorus method man

i got my mind made up come on come on
get in get in too get on it
let it ride get wit it tonights tha night
i got my mind made up come on
get in get in too
let it ride tonights tha night

verse three kurupt

well i comes through with two packs
of the bomb prophalaks for protection
so my fuckin sac wont collapse
cause nowadays shits evading the x-rays
sending young motherfuckers to an early grave
i wonder if my terrifying tactics of torturing mcs
shows my hearts as cold as the tundra
electryfing like thunder im just too much
rough and raw with that motherfuckin poisonous touch
im an mc with lyrics thats tha fuckin bom-bay
ya got dissed thats before its ingest like balmay
my rhymes i leave a mark on ya mind
as the deadly vibes spread through ya head like sam time
theres no escape nah i aint blastin
i use my mental to assassinate assassins for those askin
opposed to laughin raw maniacal villain
laughter enhances the chances of tha killin
why is that  cuz smilin faces decieve
you best believe to mcs im the deadliest disease
my thoughts rip ya throat and make it hard to breathe
ya whole camps under seige and im jason vorhees
in the heat of the night is when i defeat and ignite mikes
my verbal snipe your vocab on site
im out tha cut uncut and raw with no clause for all
so all my rhymes hit and split tha bricks on the wall
ya already have an idea about tha superior sphere
the greater rhyme creator on both sides of tha equator
i rock from here to there to philly and back
to la on the spot where i rock and bust like straps
as your views get overshadowed when you come in contact
beware set and prepare to enter verbal combat

verse four method man

fuck you losers while you fake jacks i makes maneuvers
like hitler stickin up jews wit german lugers
the mr meth-tical from staten isle
will be back after this mess-age dont touch tha dial
rarely do you see an mc out for justice
got my gun powder and my musket -- blaooow
melons get swellings i paint mental pictures like magellen
half of my clans three deep felons
niggaz best protect they joints for nine-nickel
man i stay on point like icicles
now who wanna test tical then touch tical
all up in your motherfuckin mouth
head banger boogie
catch me on tour with al doogie
method man roll too tight you can pull me
better take one and pass or thats that ass
your vital statistics are low and fallin fast
johnny blaze out to get loot like johnny cash
play a game of russian roulette and have a blast

verse five redman

aiyyo lyrical gas spittin tha criminal tactics
non-believers get my dick and genitals backwards
lets face it theres no replacement
taste this mad underground basement shit im laced with
avalanche on ya whole camp when im splifted
funk doctor who spock bitch dont get it twisted
i got connects like federal express
to get the fresh package of bless tha dogs cant fetch
got the clear spot from tha rear block
to bust til every nigga here drop men i fear not
hold ya nose and blow out til ya ears pop
since ya crew suit you to shift now you claim that you gets lot
with this underground cannabis
im dangerous like john the bomb analyst
then proceeds like keys
my degrees freeze consecutively like epmd lps
lick off a shot and hit ya fam by mistake
so i erase the whole front row at the wake
i planned my escape in case jake or a snake bust it
im the one pushin the hearse in the first place
confidence for you shaky ass folks
pump for rockafella for the day he got smoked
choke off this anecdote got you ope
get roast by my lyrics billy dee 45 coly 
and im out for nine nickel ins tha rebel
west list this this this
