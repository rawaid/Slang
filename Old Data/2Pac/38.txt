verse one 2pac

are you confused 
you wonder how it feels to walk a mile inside tha shoes
of a nigga who dont have a thing to loose
when me and you was homies
no one informed me it was all a scheme
you infiltrated my team and sold a niggas dreams
how could you do me like that 
i took ya family in
i put some cash in ya pocket
made you a man again
and now you let tha fear put your ass in a place
complicated to escape
its a fools fate
without your word
your a shell of a man
i lost respect for you nigga
we can never be friends
i know im runnin through your head now
what could you do 
if it was up to you
id be dead now
i let tha world know nigga you a coward
you could never be live
until you die
see tha mothafucken bitch in your eye
type of nigga that let tha evil of tha money trap me
when ya see me nigga
ya better holla at me holla at me
cant let tha evil of tha money trap me
so when ya see me nigga
ya better holla at me

chorus 2pac

you better beware where you lay
we better not find where you stay

so i gotta be carefull cant let tha evil of tha money trap me
so when ya see me nigga
ya better holla at me

you better beware where you lay
we better not find where you stay

verse two 2pac

courious
spittin lyrics
on tha verge of furious
im addicted to currency
nigga thats why were doin this
i got shot up i surprised tha niggas tha way i got up
and then
i hit the studio
its time to blow tha block up
no hesitation
this information got you contemplatin
heartbreakin and eliminatin with this conversation
break him
and let him see tha face of a mental patient
its a celebration
of my criminal elevation
with the participation
i want members across tha fifty states
to keep tha nation anticipatin until we break
will i be great is it my fate 
to live tha life of luxury
some niggas bought my tapes
so much jelousy it scares me
so be prepared
cause only tha strong survive
life isnt fair fair
probably never knew tha way it feels to die
so you figure fuck with me
i give that ass a try
nigga holla at me

chorus

you better beware where you lay
we better not find where you stay

ohhhhhh

verse three 2pac

i shoulda saw tha signs
i was blinded
criminal minds of a young black brotha doin time
so many brothas framed in this dirty game
its a shame
so much pressure on my brain
while she blame me
secrets in tha dark
only her and i know
now im sitten in tha state pen
doin time for slow
guess she made a bad decision
that got me livin
just like an animal
im caged up in state prison
my niggas dissin
cause
hell have no fury like a woman scorn
a cemetary full of mothafuckers got not knowin
picture my prophecy
tha cops are attacking me on top of me
im runnin from tha coppers
but never letem stop me
cause im a soulja
hell ever since i was a little nigga havin fantasies
of one day getting older
niggas is paranoid
trust
a no no
love is a mystery
fuck tha po po
holla at me
so when you see me nigga
you better holla at me

chorus

you better beware where you lay
we better not find where you stay

niggas out there jelous cuz we be bailin with death row
they try to playa hate
but they cant fade us tho
we be mobbin through tha neigborhood
yeah
with that funky sound so funky
we be throwin down

chorus

you better beware where you lay
we better not find where you stay

ohhhhhhhh heeeeyyy ohhhhh nooo noooo noooooo
