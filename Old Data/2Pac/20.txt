i proceed to make them shiver 
when i deliver
criminal lyrics 
from a world wide mob figure
thug niggas from everywhere mr mackaveli
niggas is waiting for some thug shit thats what they tell me
so many rumors but im infinitely immortal outlaw
switching up on you ordinary bitches 
like a south paw you get let
and every breath i breathe untill the moment im deceased
will be another moment ballin as a g
i rip the crowd then i start again
internally i live in sin 
untill the moment that they let me breathe again
the heartz of men

chorus

the heartz of men

my lyrical verse with so much pain 
that to some niggas it hurts 
my guns bust
and if you aint one of us 
it gets worse
bitch niggas get their eyes swoll 
in fly mode
im a homicidal outlaw 
and five-o get your lights on fight long 
tonights gonna be a fuckin fight 
so we might roll
my own homies say im heartless
but im a g to this til the day im gone thats regardless
drive-by niggas bow down
thought id rot in jail paid bail well niggas out now
throw up your hands if you thugged out
first nigga act up 
first nigga gettin drugged out
i can be a villian if ya let me 
ill muthafuck ya 
if ya do upset me 
tell the cops to come and get me
rip the crowd like a phone number
then start again dont have no muthafuckin friends nigga
look inside the heartz of men

chorus

in the heartz of men
in the heartz of men

to all my niggas engaged in making money in the fifty states
keep your mind on your chips and fuck a punk bitch
no longer living in fear 
my pistol close in hand
convinced this is my year 
like im the chosen man
give me my money and label me as a don
if niggas is having problems 
smokeem fire and bomb
i died and came back 
i hustle with these lyrics as if its a game of crack
thugin is in my spirit
im lost and not knowing 
scard up 
but still flowing
energized and still going
uhh can it be fate 
that makes a sick muthafucka break
on these jealous ass coward cuz they evil and fake
what will it takeÂ 
give me that bass line 
im feeling bombed
deathrow baby dont be alarmed
the homie quik gave a nigga a beat and let me start again
represent 
cause ive been sent
the heartz of men
