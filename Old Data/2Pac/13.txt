i shall not fear no man but god
though i walk through tha valley of death
i shed so many tears
please god walk with me

back in elementry i thrived on misery
left me alone i grew up amongst a dying breed
inside mind couldnt find a place ta rest
untill i got that thug life tatted on my chest
tell me can ya feel me 
im not liven in tha past you wanna last
be tha first ta blast remember kato
no longer with us hes deseased
call on tha sirens i seem him murdered in tha streets
now rest in peace
is there heaven for a g 
remember me so many homies in the cemetary
shed so many tears

chorus

lord
i suffer through tha years
and shed so many tears
lord
i lost so many peers and shed so many tears

now that im strugglin in this business
by any means label me greedy gettin green
but seldom seen
and fuck tha world cuz im cursed
im havin visions of leaven here in a hurse
god can ya feel me
take me away from all tha pressure and all tha pain
show me some happiness again
im goin blind
i spend my time in this cell aint livin well
i know my destiny is hell where did i fail 
my life is in denial
and when i die babtised in eternal fire
shed so many tears

chorus

lord
i suffer through tha years
and shed so many tears
lord
i lost so many peers and shed so many tears

now im lost and im weary
so many tears im suicidal so dont stand near me
my every move is a compilated step
ta bring me closer
to embrace an early death now theres nothing left
there was no mercy on tha streets
i couldnt rest
im barely standing bout to go to pieces screaming peace
and though my soul was deleted i couldnt see it
i had my mind full of demons tryin ta break free
they planted seeds and they hatched sparking tha flame
inside my brain like a match such a dirty game
no memories just misery
painting a picture of my enemies killing me in my sleep
will i survive till tha morning ta see tha sun
please lord forgive me for my sins
cause here i come

chorus

lord
i suffer through tha years
and shed so many tears
god
i lost so many peers and

lord knows ive tried been a witness ta homicide
drive-bys taken lives little kids die
wonder why as i walk by
broken hearted as i glance at tha chaulk line gettin high
this aint tha life for me
i wanna change
but aint no future right for me
im stuck in tha game
im trapped inside a maze
see this tangaray influenced me ta gettin crazy
disillusioned lately
ive been really wanting babies
so i could see a part of me that wasnt always shady
dont trust my lady
cause shes a product of this poison im hearen noises
think shes fucken on my boys cant take no more
im fallin to tha floor
beggin for tha lord ta let me in heavens door
i shed so many tears

chorus

lord
i lost so many peers
and shed so many tears
i lost so many peers and shed so many tears
i suffered through tha years and shed so many tears
