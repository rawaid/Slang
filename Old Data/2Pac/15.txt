verse one 2pac

can you picture my prophecy
stress in the city the cops is hot for me
the projects is full of bullets the bodies is droppin
there aint no stoppin me
constantly movin while makin millions
witnessin killings leavin dead bodies in abandoned buildings
carries to children cause theyre illin
addicted to killin and the appeal from the cap peelin
without feelin but will they last or be blasted
hard headed bastard
maybe hell listen in his casket -- the aftermath
more bodies being buried -- im losing my homies in a hurry
theyre relocating to the cemetary
got me worried stressin my visions blurried
the question is will i live  no one in the world loves me
im headed for danger dont trust strangers
put one in the chamber whenever im feelin this anger
dont wanna make excuses cause this is how it is
whats the use unless were shootin no one notices the youth
its just me against the world baby

verse two dramacydal

could somebody help me im out here all by myself
see ladies in stones baby capones livin wealthy
pictures of my birth on this earth is what im dreamin
seein daddys semen full of crooked demons already crazy
and screamin i guess them nightmares as a child
had me scared but left me prepared for a while
is there another route for a crooked outlaw
veteran a villain a young thug who one day shall fall

everday theres modeath and plus im dough-less

scheme on the scheming and leave they peeps grieving
cause aint no bucks to stack up my nuts is backed up

verse three 2pac

with all this extra stressin
the question i wonder is after death after my last breath
when will i finally get to rest  through this supression
they punish the people thats askin questions
and those that possess steal from the ones without possesions
the message i stress to make it stop study your lessons
dont settle for less - even the genius asks-es questions
be grateful for blessings
dont ever change keep your essence
the power is in the people and politics we address
always do your best dont let the pressure make you panic
and when you get stranded
and things dont go the way you planned it
dreamin of riches in a position of makin a difference
politicians and hypocrites they dont wanna listen
if im insane its the fame made a brother change
it wasnt nuttin like the game
its just me against the world

girl	me against the world
2pac	nuttin to lose
	its just me against the world baby
girl	me against the world
2pac	got me stuck in the game
	its just me against the world
girl	oahahhhh
2pac	id be ashamed to lose
	its just me against the world baby
girl	me against the world

outro 2pac

through every dark night theres a bright day after that
so no matter how hard it get stick your chest out
keep your head up and handle it

girl	me against the world
me against the world
