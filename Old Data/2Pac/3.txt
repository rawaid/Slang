uhh
hit them with a lil ghetto gospel

chorus - elton john
those who wish to follow me my ghetto gospel
i welcome with my hands
and the red sun sinks at last into the hills of gold
and peace to this young warrior without the sound of guns

2pac
if i could recollect before my hood days
id sit and reminisce thinkin of  bliss and the good days
i stop and stare at the younger my heart goes toem
they tested it was stressed that they under
in our days things changed
everyones ashamed to the youth cuz the truth looks strange
and for me its reversed we left them a world thats cursed and it hurts
cause any day theyll push the button
and all good men like malcolm x and bobby hunton died for nothin
dont them let me get teary the world looks dreary
but when you wipe your eyes see it clearly
theres no need for you to fear me
if you take the time to hear me maybe you can learn to cheer me
it aint about black or white cuz were human
i hope we see the light before its ruined
my ghetto gospel

those who wish to follow me my ghetto gospel

tell me do you see that old lady aint it sad
living out a bag but shes glad for the little things she has
and over there theres a lady crack got her crazy
guess shes given birth to a baby
i dont trip and let it fade me from outta the frying pan
we jump into another form of slavery
even now i get discouraged
wonder if they take it all back while i still keep the courage
i refuse to be a role model
i set goals take control drink out my own bottle
i make mistakes but learn from every one
and when its said and done
i bet this brotha be a better one
if im upset you dont stress
never forget that god hasnt finished with me yet
i feel his hand on my brain
when i write rhymes i go blind and let the lord do his thang
but am i less holy
cuz i choose to puff a blunt and drink a beer with my homies
before we find world peace
we gotta find peace in that war on the streets
my ghetto gospel

chorus - elton john
those who wish to follow me yeah my ghetto gospel
i welcome with my hands
and the red sun sinks at last into the hills of gold
and peace to this young warrior without the sound of guns

2pac
lord can you hear me speak
to pay the price of being hell bound
