how many brothas fell victim to tha streetz
rest in peace young nigga theres a heaven for a g
itd be a lie if i told ya that i never thought of death

verse one

as i bail through tha empty halls
breath stinkin in my draws
ring ring ring
quiet yall
incoming call
plus this my homie from high school
hes getting bye
its time to bury another brotha nobody cry
life as a baller
alchol and booty calls
we usta do them as adolecents
do you recall
raised as gs
loced out and blazed the weed
get on tha roof
lets get smoked out
and blaze with me
2 in tha morning
and we still high assed out
screamin thug till i die
before i passed out
but now that your gone
im in the zone
thinkin
i dont wanna die all alone
but now ya gone
and all i got left are stinkin memories
i love them niggas to death
im drinkin hennessy
while tryin ta make it last
i drank a 5th for that ass
when you passed
cause life goes on

chorus

verse two

yeah nigga
i got tha word as hell
blew trial and tha judge gave you
25 with an l
time to prepare to do fed time
wont see parole
imagine life as a convict
thats getten old
plus with tha drama
were lookin out for your babies mama
taken risks while keepin cheap tricks from beatin on her
life in tha hood
is all good for nobody
remember gamin on dumb hotties at your party
me and you
no true a two
while scheming on hits
and gettin tricks
that maybe we can slide into
but now you burried
rest nigga
cause i aint worried
eyes blurry
sayin goodbye at the cemetery
tho memories fade
i got your name tated on my arm
so we both ball til my dying days
before i say goodbye
kato and mental rest in peace
thug till i die

chorus

verse three

bury me smilin
with gs in my pocket
have a party at my funeral
let every rapper rock it
let tha hoes that i usta know
from way before
kiss me from my head to my toe
give me a paper and a pen
so i can write about my life of sin
a couple bottles of gin
in case i dont get in
tell all my people im a ridah
nobody cries when we die
we outlaws
let me ride
until i get free
i live my life in tha fast lane
got police chasen me
to my niggas from old blocks 
from old crews
niggas that guided me through 
back in tha old school
pour out some liquor
have a toast for tha homies
see we both gotta die
but ya chose to go before me
and brothas miss ya while your gone
you left your nigga on his own
how long we mourn
life goes on

chorus repeats to end
spoken over repeating chorus
