tupac talking

heaven aint hard to find
all you gotta do is look

tupac

simply because you nervous let me start off with my conversation
hoping my information alleviates the hesitation
i can see it clearly now
catch you smiling through your frown
im askin baby boo are you down 
although i know youve heard about my reputation
across the nation
mr i get around
my temptation got me dripping wet
perspiration
im activated by the moves you making
baby why you faking strip naked get the love making
see its all in your mind so every time i sip a glass of wine
i fantasize till that ass is mine
never gettin but wanting never touching but wishing
a straight thug on a mission until i get what im missing
stop with the beeper baby listen
i know youre grown but pay attention
let me hypnotize you with my tongue kissin
this is a message to bomb bodies and all dimes

turn around one more time
heaven aint hard to find

chorus

heaveeen
heaven aint hard to find
heaven aint hard to find

heaven aint hard to find
in fact you can have it just have faith
just like a little kid still believing in magic
it takes a lot of sacrifice
with all the lonely nights on tour
i need somebody i can trust in my life
let me apply the brakes
baby youre moving to fast
my conversations are getting deeper but first let me ask
are you afraid of a thug 
and have you ever made love with candles and bubbles sippin in the tub
touch me and let me activate your blood pressure
this thug passion
help the average man love better
picture me naked and glistening beneath the moonlight mist
take a shot of that alizé
come give me a kiss
and maybe we can be better friends
perhaps well be closer
ill be the thug in your life
baby and youll be my soulja
and i know it takes some time
and you got a lot of questions on your mind
but relax in due time
heaven aint hard to find

chorus

heaveeen
heaven aint hard to find
heaven aint hard to find

you think we all dogs thats why you cautious when i approached you
been talking since you arrived but not a word is spoken
through my eye contact i wink and you respond back
look at me

its like the closer you get baby the quicker im speaking
i gotta fly down to cabo lets kick it this weekend
im sipping hennessey and coke
tho addicted to weed smoke

oh god help me identify my truest thoughts
your hidden motives full of passion who would of thought
come holler at me baby love me for my thug nature
far from a playa hater label me a money maker
straight heart breaker

once we begin
until the end it gets better with time
