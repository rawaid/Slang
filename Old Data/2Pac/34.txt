im spittin at tricks cause im addicted to pretty bitches
currency motivated not easily terminated
now that we made it my niggaz can never be faded

all you cowards that try to stop me is beggin for early graves
i thought we was cool i was a fool thinkin you could be true
when i dont fuck with your punk crew
these are the tales for my niggaz doin time in the cell
i went from hell to livin well
bustin at niggaz who said my name in vain
i got no time for them tricks im heavy in the game
