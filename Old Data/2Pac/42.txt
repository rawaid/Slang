keepin it real

verse one 2pac

i take a shot of henessey now im strong enough to face the madness
nickel bag full of sess weed laced with hash
phone calls from my niggaz on the other side
two childhood friends just died i couldnt cry
a damn shame when will we ever change
and what remains from a twelve gauge to the brain
arguements with my boo is true
i spend mo time with my niggaz than i do with you
but everywhere its the same thang thats the game
ill be damned if a thang changed fuck the fame
ill be hustling to make a mill-ion lord knows
aint no love for us ghetto children so we cold
rag top slowin down time to stop for gas
beep my horn for a hoochie with a proper ass uhh
it aint easy thats my motto
drinkin tanqueray straight out the bottle
everybody wanna know if im insane
my baby mama gotta mind full of silly games
and all the drama got me stressin like im hopeless i cant cope
me and the homies smokin roaches cause we broke
late night hangin out til the sunrise gettin high
watchin the cops roll by
it aint easy thats right

chorus 2pac

it aint easy being me
will i see the penitentiary or will i stay free
repeat 3x

verse two 2pac

i cant sleep niggaz plottin on to kill me while im dreamin
wake up sweaty and screamin cause i can hear them suckers schemin
probably paranoid problem is them punks be fantasizin
a brother bite the bullet open fire and i died
i wonder why this the way it is even now
lookin out for these killer kids cause they wild
bill clinton can you recognize a nigga representin
doin twenty to life in san quentin
gettin calls from my nigga mike tyson aint nuttin nice
yo pac do something righteous witcha life
and even thou you innocent you still a nigga so they figure
rather have you behind bars than triggers
but im hold ya down and holla thug life lickin shots
til i see my niggaz free on the block
but no it aint easy hahahah
til i see my niggaz free on the block oh
it aint easy

chorus 275

verse three 2pac

lately been reminiscin
bout peppermint schnapps in junior high hit the block
keep an eye on the cops while d-boys slang rocks
its the project kid without a conscience im havin dreams
of hearin screams at my concerts me all my childhood peers
through the years tryin to stack a little green
i was only seventeen when i started servin fiends
and i wish there was another way to stack a dollar
so my apoli casue these hard times make me wanna holler
will i live to see tommorrow am i fallin off
i hit the weed and then proceed to say fuck all of yall
aint nobody down with me im thuggin i cant go home
cause muh-fuckers think im buggin so now im in
this high powered cell at the county jail
punk judge got a grudge cant post no bail what
do i do in these county blues
gettin battered and bruised by the you know who
and these fakes get to shakin when they face me
snakes aint got enough nuts to replace me
sittin in this livin hell listenin to niggaz yell
tryin to torture em to tell im gettin mail
but aint nobody sayin much the same old nuts
is makin bucks while these sluts is gettin fucked
they violated my probation and it seems
ill be goin on a long vacation meanwhile
it aint easy
no it aint easy
