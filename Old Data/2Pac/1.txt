2pac
so many battlefield scars while driven in plush cars
this life as a rap star is nothin without heart
was born rough and rugged addressin the mad public
my attitude was fuck it cause motherfuckers love it
to be a soldier must maintain composure at ease
though life is complicated only what you make it to be
uhh and my ambitions as a ridah to catch her
while she hot and horny go up inside her
then i spit some game in her ear go to the tele hoe
you put what money in a benz cause bitch im barely broke
im smokin bomb-ass weed feelin crucial
from player to player the games tight the feelings mutual
from hustlin and prayers to breakin motherfuckers to pay-up
i got no time for these bitches cause these hoes tried to play us
im on a meal-ticket mission want a mil so im wishin
competition got me ripped on that bullshit they stressin boo-yaa
ima rhyme though clown hoes like its manditory
no guts no glory my nigga bitch got the game distorted
now its on and its on because i said so
cant trust a bitch in the bidness so i got with death row
now these money hungry bitches gettin suspicious
started plottin and plannin on schemes to come and trick us
but thug niggaz be on point and game tight yeah

so now im back to be a motherfuckin menace they cowards
thats why they tried to set me up
had bitch-ass niggaz on my team so indeed they wet me up
but im back reincarnated incarcerated
at the time i caught the perfect way that god made it
