you know they got me trapped in this prison of seclusion
happiness living on tha streets is a delusion
even a smooth criminal one day must get caught
shot up or shot down with tha bullet that he bought
nine millimeter kickin thinking about what tha streets do to me
cause they never talk peace in tha black community
all we know is violence do tha job in silence
walk tha city streets like a rat pack of tyrants
too many brothers daily heading for tha big penn
niggas commin out worse off than when they went in
over tha years i done alot of growin up
getten drunk thrown up
cuffed up
then i said i had enough
there must be another route way out
to money and fame i changed my name
and played a different game
tired of being trapped in this vicious cycle
if one more cop harrasses me i just might go psycho
and when i gettem
ill hittem with tha bum rush
only a lunatic would like to see his skull crushed
yo if your smart youll really let me go g
but keep me cooped up in this ghetto and catch tha uzi
they got me trapped

chorus
uh uh they cant keep tha black man down
they got me trapped
naw they cant keep tha black man down
trapped
uh uh they cant keep tha black man down
trapped
naw they cant keep tha black man down

they got me trapped
can barely walk tha city streets
without a cop harrassing me searching me
then asking my identity
hands up throw me up against tha wall
didnt do a thing at all
im tellen you one day these suckers gotta fall
cuffed up throw me on tha concrete
coppers try to kill me
but they didnt know this was tha wrong street
bang bang down another casualty
but its a cop whos shot theres brutality
who do you blame
its a shame because tha mans slain
he got caught in tha chains of his own game
how can i feel guilty after all tha things they did to me
sweated me hunted me
trapped in my own community
one day im gonna bust
blow up on this society
why did ya lie to me 
i couldnt find a trace of equality
work me like a slave while they laid back
homie dont play that
its time i lettem suffer tha payback
im tryin to avoid physical contact
i cant hold back its time to attack jack
they got me trapped

chorus
uh uh they cant keep tha black man down
you know they got me trapped
naw they cant keep tha black man down
trapped
uh uh they cant keep tha black man down
you know they got me trapped
naw they cant keep tha black man down

now im trapped and want to find a getaway
all i need is a g and somewhere safe to stay
cant use tha phone
cause im sure someone is tappin in
did it before
aint scared to use my gat again
i look back at hindsite the fight was irrelevant
but now hes tha devils friend
too late to be tellin him
he shot first and ill be damned if i run away
homie is done away i should of put my gun away
i wasnt thinkin all i heard was tha ridicule
girlies was laughin tup sayin damn homies is dissin you
i fired my weapon
started steppin in tha hurricane
i got shot so i dropped
feelin a burst of pain
got to my feet
couldnt see nothin but bloody blood
now im a fugitive to be hunted like a murderer
ran through an alley
still lookin for my getaway
coppers said freeze or youll be dead today
trapped in a corner
dark and i couldnt see tha light
thoughts in my mind was tha nine and a better life
what do i do 
live my life in a prison cell
id rather die than be trapped in a living hell
they got me trapped

chorus
uh uh they cant keep tha black man down
they got me trapped
naw they cant keep tha black man down
trapped
uh uh they cant keep tha black man down
you know they got me trapped
naw they cant keep tha black man down
trapped
