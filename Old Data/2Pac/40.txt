child why you by the window whats wrong daddy
mother i know whats wrong with that crazy motherfucker
hes just stand by the goddamn window
with that fuckin ak all day
you dont work you dont fuck you dont
you dont do a goddamn thing

i see death around the corner gotta stay high while i survive
in the city where the skinny niggas die
if they bury me bury me as a g nigga no need to worry
i expect retaliation in a hurry
i see death around the corner any day
trying to keep it together no one lives forever anyway
strugglin and strivin my destinys to die
keep my finger on the trigger no mercy in my eyes
in a ball of confusion i think about my daddy
madder than a motherfucker they never shoulda had me
i guess i seen too many murders the doctors cant help me
got me stressin with my pistol in my sheets it aint healthy
am i paranoid tell me the truth
im out the window with my ak ready to shoot
ran out of endo and my mind cant take the stress
im out of breath
make me wanna kill my damn self
but i see death around the corner

chorus

when we were kids belonging felt good
i see death around the corner
but having respect that feels even better
i see death around the corner
when we were kids belonging felt good
i see death around the corner
but having respect that feels even better

i see death around the corner
the pressures getting to me
i no longer trust my homies

under my clothes when i dress

my homie told me once

but they phony motherfuckers
and even if i did die young who cares
all i ever got was mean mugs and cold stares
i got homies in my head

i cant give up although im hopeless
i think my minds gone
all i can do is get my grind on death around the corner

chorus

i was raised in the city shitty
ever since i was an itty bitty kitty
drinkin liquor out my mommas titty
and smokin weed was an everyday thang in my household
and drinking liquor til you out cold

i hope the lord will forgive me i was a g
and gettin high was a way of gettin free
i see death around the corner

chorus

and make sure he handles his motherfuckin business
