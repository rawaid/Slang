relax yourself girl please set-tle down 4x

verse one q-tip phife dawg

honey check it out you got me mesmerized
with your black hair and fat-ass thighs
street poetry is my everyday
but yo i gotta stop when you trot my way
if i was workin at the club you would not pay
aiyyo my man phife diggy he got somthin to say

i like em brown yellow puero rican or hatian
name is phife dawg from the zulu nation
told you in the jam that we can get down
now lets knock the boots like the group h-town
you got bbd all on your bedroom wall
but im above the rim and this is how i ball
a pretty little somethin on the new york street
this is how i represent over this here beat
talkin bout you

yo i took you out
but sex was on my mind for the whole damn route
my mind was in a frenzy and a horny state
but i couldnt drop dimes cause *you couldnt relate*

chorus

verse two q-tip phife dawg

stretch out your legs let me make you bawl
drive you insane drive you up the wall
starin at your dome-piece very strong
stronger than pride stronger than teflon
take you on the ave and you buy me links
now i wanna pound the putang until it stinks
you can be my mama and ill be your boy

original rude boy never am i coy
you can be a shorty in my ill convoy
not to come across as a thug or a hood
but hon you got the goods like madeline woods
by the way my names malik
the five-foot freak
lets say we get together by the end of the week
she simply said no labelled me a hoe
i said how you figure  my friends told me so
i hate when silly groupies wanna run they yap
word to god hon i dont get down like that

ill have you weak in the knees that you could hardly speak
or we could do like uncle l and swing an ep in my jeep
keep it in the down yo we keep it discrete
see im not the type to kid to have my biz in the streets

if my mom dont approve then ill just elope
let me sink the little man from inside the boat
let me hit it from the back girl i wont catch a hernia
bust off on your couch now you got seamens furniture

shaheed phife and the extra p
stacyÂ  dj and my man lg
they know the abstract is really soul on ice
the character is  of men never ever of mice
shorty let me tell you about my only vice
it has to do with lots of lovin and *it aint nuthin nice*

chorus
