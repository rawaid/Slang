q-tip
back in the days when i was a teenager
before i had status and before i had a pager
you could find the abstract listening to hip hop
my pops used to say it reminded him of be-bop
i said well daddy dont you know that things go in cycles
the way that bobby brown is just ampin like michael
its all expected things are for the lookin
if you got the money quest is for the bookin
come on everybody lets get with the fly modes
still got room on the truck load the back boom
listen to the rhyme to get a mental picture
of this black man through black woman victim
why do i say that cuz i gotta speak the truth man
doing what we feel for the music is the proof and
planted on the ground the act is so together
bonafide strong you need leverage to sever
the unit yes the unit yes the unit called the jazz is
deliberately cheered lp filled with street goods
you can find it on the rack in your record store store
if you get the record then your thoughts are adored 
and appreciated cause were ever so glad we made it
we work hard so we gotta thank god
dishin out the plastic do the dance till youre spastic
if you dis it gets drastic
listen to the rhymes cuz its time to make gravy
if it moves your booty then shake shake it baby
all the way to africa aka the motherland uh
stick out the left then ill ask for the other hand
thats the right hand black man man
only if you are noted as my man man
if i get the credit then ill think i deserve it 
if you fake moves dont fix your mouth to word it
get in the zone of positivity not negativity
cuz we gotta strive for longevity
if you botch up whats in that ass what
a pair of nikes size ten-and-a-half come on come on

chorus

we gotta make moves
never ever ever could we fake moves come on come on 4x

time time is a ship on a merciless sea
drifting toward an average of nothingness
until it can be retarded for its own destiny
time is an inanimate object
praying and praying and praying with no justification for belief
time is dancing moving lingering all memories of past
	- the last poets

we gotta be a winner all the time
cant fall prey to a hip hop crime
with the dope raps and dope tracks for you for blocks
from the fly girlies to the hardest of the rocks
musically the quest is on the rise
we on these excursions so you must realize
that continually i pop my zulu
if you dont like it get off the zulu tip
so what can you do in the times which exist
you cant fake moves on your brother or your sis
but if your sis is a bitch brother is a jerk
leave em both alone and continue with your work
whatever it may be in todays society
everything is fair at least that how it seems to me
you must be honest and true to the next 
dont be phony and expect one not to flex
especially if you rhyme you have to live by the pen
your man is your man then treat him like your friend
all it is is the code of the streets 
so listen to the knowledge bein dropped over beats
beats that are hard beats that are funky
it could get you hooked like a crackhead junkie
what you gotta do to is know that the tribe is in the sphere
the abstract poet prominent like shakespeare

chorus

edgar allan poe it dont stop uh

time is running out on black power africans in the day
and white thigh supporters at night
everytime you see them theyre chasing some white woman with their tongues hangin out
time is running and passing; passing and running
running and passing; passing and running excursions
