verse one phife dawg

1988 senior year at garvey high
where all the guys were corny but the girls were mad fly
loungin with the tipster coolin with sha
scopin out the honeys - they know who they are
i was the b-ball playin fly rhyme sayin
fly girl gettin but never was i sweatin
cause when it came to honeys i would go on a stroll
until i met my match - her name was flo
yeah - i messed around with the one called flo
all the troopers round the way used to call her a ho
but deep down in my heart i knew that flo was good to go
cause i thought it was me - like bell biv devoe
but little did i know that she was playin with my mind
the only thing ive learned is good girls are hard to find
i feel like heavy d i need somebody for me
not someone whos mind is blank and tryin to juice me for my bank
swingin with my main man lucky behind my back
what type of crap is that - yo hows about a smack
word life i cant front - thought i was all that
but now it seems i met my match
was a stone cold lover you couldnt tell me jack
settlin down with one girl wasnt tryin to hear that
i had tonya tamika sharon karen
tina stacy julie tracy
used to love em leave em skeeze em tease em
find em lose em - also abuse em
my whole attitude was new day next hon
and believe it or not they all got done
well here comes flo with the crazy whip appeal
and im all true man like alexander oneal
is this really love then again how would i know
after all this time tryin to be a superhoe
she finally played me but yo id find another
cause i got the crazy game and yo im smooth like butter

chorus q-tip

butter like butter baby    repeat 2x
not no parkay not no margarine
strickly butter baby strictly butter

verse two phife dawg

i remember when
girls were goodie two shoes but now they turned to freaks
all of a sudden we love you phife - ease of ho my names malik
phife this phife that where you goin where you at
these girls dont know me from jack yet i feel like the mack
you didnt want me then so yo hon dont want me now
here here - take the towel wipe off your brow
and take the contact out your eye youre far from lookin fly
you get an e for effort and t for nice try
now tell me whats the reason for dyin your hair
slum village gold still danglin in your ear
you barely have a neck but still sportin a rope
four-finger ring just so phifer can scope
you looked in the mirror didnt know what to do
yesterday your eyes were brown but today they are blue
your whole appearance is a lie and it could never be true
and if you really liked yourself then you would try and be you
if your hair and eyes were real i wouldnt have dissed ya
but since it was bought i had to dismiss ya
but if you cant achieve it then why not try and weave it
if you cant extend it then you might as well suspend it
if you cant braid it best thing to do is fade it
i asked who did your hair and you tell me diane made it
if you were you and just you talk to you maybe
but i cant stand no bionic lady
tryin hard to look fly but yo youre lookin dumber
if i wanted someone like you i woulda swung with jamie summers
you wanna be treated right see father mc
or check ralph tresvant for sens-a-tiv-i-ty
see i am not the one i got more game than parker brothers
phife dog is on the mic and im smooth like butter
