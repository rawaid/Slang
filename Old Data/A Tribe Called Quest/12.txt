q-tip

let me flaunt the style style i think that the times near
that we drop studs studs there will be no duds here
rappers play the dumb dumb kinda on the space tip
but when they hear the jams jams they be on the dilsnick
now im not for the rock rock i know the territory
go ahead and try try thats a different story
similar to grimm grimm i can tell a better one
all about a kid kid who couldnt rap and didnt run
stand stand aside aside when the rap is gettin dumb
resort to baggin billy billy askin can he have some
no never ever ever come back and try again man
if you come back back ill be the first to shake your hand
competitions good good it brings out the vital parts
the abstract poetic etic majors in recital arts
do it for the kids kids the elders and the rap peers
we know the job is done done when we hear a lot of cheers
gotta feel the vibes vibes come from my creation
if the hands clap clap im filled with elation
here i am ghetto full with a lot of steam
think i gotta i think i gotta i think i gotta scream scream
cuz thats how good it feels child
let your hair down down so we can get buckwild
do your ill dance dance dont think about the next man
we must have unity and think of the bigger plan
division we will fall fall we must stick together see
id like to take this time time to say whats up to kool g
the name is q-tip tip the midnight marauder
give enough respect spect to afrika bambaataa
as a man in the world world i must do my job
take care of mama duke duke i wont resort to rob
bob youll get your dough dough mase is my witness
obsessed with the rap rap for its the mental fitness
like shootin cee-lo lo and always gettin headcracks
the industry is luck luck winning with the fake raps
peace to the crews crews who pump the real hip hop
not sellin out out from hardrock to disc jock
from disc jock to hardrock from hardrock to disc jock

phife

i dont know what to say but here i go freak it
if the papes come then you know ill seek it
im just a short brotha dark skin face
weigh a buck-fifty 36 waist
my hair is crazy curly

to this day i still believe that no mc can serve me
brothas try to front but everybody know know
i get more props than the arsenio hall show
party animal i was but now i chill at home
all i do is write rhymes eat drink shit and bone
found my thrill in amityville im always in the island
fudge and monkey know the time they know who keeps em smilin
go out on my own somethin that i gotta do
do what the hell i want and have no one to listen to
im prompt with my business and i do things on the double
