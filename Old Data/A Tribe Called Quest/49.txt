verse one kamaal q-tip

yo i was riding the train
and this puerto rican kid said simple and plain
lets battle - it kinda took me by surprised
cuz the brother was moving wit his eyes on the prize
i said screw it i aint got nuttin to lose but um
but i got to do this shit real quick so um
hurry up kid bust your joints and then ill bust mine
and i be out cuz i got to see this hottie he said ok
now check it check it out blah blah blah blah blah thats what he said
then i came back and just fucked up his head
cuz yo he thought an mc who was seen on tv
couldnt hold the shit down in new york city
aiyyo i showed his ass then i went off on my task
to bless her ass uptown real mcs will hold it down
yea yea sonny to the beat like that
you wanna bring it to me where you at

verse two phife dawg

yes dread i had a similiar situation
when this kid tried to tell me i didnt deserve my occupation
he said i wasnt shit that i was soon to fall
i looked him up and down grab my crotch and said balls
of course he tried to bring it on the battling tip
ay you know me you know i had to come out my shit
trying to lounge at the mall meet skef and mr walton
finally i banged his ass wit the verbal assault
he said a rhyme about his 45 and his nickelbags of weed
thats when i preceeded to give him what he needed
talking bout i need a phillie right before i get loose
poor excuse money please i get loose off of orange juice
preferly minute maid cuz thats exactly what it takes
to write a rhyme huh to school your nickels and your dimes
because an mc like me be on tv
dont mean i cant hold my shit down in nyc

phony rappers who do not write
phony rappers who do not excite
phony rappers you know they type
phony rappers check it

verse three phife consequence

it seems theres a sanitation yard full of trash talkers
sounding good but money can you feed the dog hawker
talking bout your mic days and your breakdancing
not enhancing you sound tired
oh shit i didnt know you like to play yourself in frontcha friends
sitting there lying to no end
mcs for me make things happening
talk about a world but in a form of rapping
who will be the captain of this ship
if it goes down dont you know you have to go wit it
just because you rhyme for a couple of weeks
doesnt mean that youve reach the mcs peak
let me stop sounding all bitter
ghetto child never be a quitter
but dont be a phony in the litter
take it as a letter from the better
take it from a man who used to rhyme in busted ass jettas

c yo phife you need a condom
p word to god mess around
i catch aids from mcs being on my nuts too hard
c  cuz on my blvd you better bring your bodyguard
p  and whats your blvd
c  lb i represent naturally
p  so dont step on the rolly if you know that youre phony
or else i bend that ass like elbow macaroni
cuz i gotta keep it real gotta keep it real
a tribe called quest you see we never half step
c  so on your mark get ready mcs be jetti
me and phifey be on ya like veronica and betty
archie jughead snuffing mcs
from brainslane down  to hempstead
p  yes quence see over
his rhyme style is older that a chrysler cordoba
im wilder then the cats from arizona
villanova un un kentucky
whos the next mc stepping up to try and bust me
bring him here and boy will i ever let him have it
c  and when it comes to the microphone dont even try to grab it
what
