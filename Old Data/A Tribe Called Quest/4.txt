q-tip
people give your ears so i be sublime
its enjoyable to know you and the concubine
niggaz take off your coats ladies act liike gems
sit down indian style as we recite these hymns
see lyrically im mario andretti on the mo-mo
ludicrously speedy or infectious with the slow-mo
heard me in the eighties j beez on the promo
on my never endin quest to get the paper on the caper
but now let me take it to the queens side
im takin it to brooklyn side
all the residential questers to invade the way
hold up a second son cuz we almost there
you can be a black man and lose all your soul
you can be white and blue but dont crap the roll
see my shit is universal if you got knowledge and dolo
of delf for self see theres no one else 
who can drop it on the angle acute at that
so do that do that do do that that thatcome on
do that do that do do that that thatok
do that do that do do that that that
im buggin out so let me get back cuz im wettin niggaz

phife
back in 89 i simply slid into place
buddy buddy buddy all up in your face
a lot of kids was bustin rhymes but they had no taste
some said quest was wack but now is that the case
i have a quest to have the mic in my hand
without that its like kryptonite and superman
so shaheed come in with the sugar cuts
phife dawgs my name but on stage call me dynomutt
when was the last time you heard the phifer sloppy
lyrics anonymous youll never hear me copy
top notch baby never comin less
skys the limit you gots to believe up in quest
sit back  relax get up out the path
if not that heres the dancefloor come move that ass
non-believers you can the steps
i roll with shaheed and the brotha abstract
niggaz know the time when the quest is in the jam
i never let a statue tell me how nice i am
comin with more hits than the braves and the yankees
livin mad phat like an over sized bam-bi
the wackest crews try to dis it makes me laugh
when my track records longer than a dc-20 aircraft
so next time that you think you want somethin here
make somethin deffer take that garbage to st elsewhere
