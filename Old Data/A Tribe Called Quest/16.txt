chorus george clinton from funkadelics lets take it to the people
everthing is fair when youre livin in the city8x

q-tip
lookin at miss lane it was the fast lane
barely knows her name struck by fame
she just got a benz she rides with her friends
gotta keep her beeper in her purse to make ends
rollin down the block checkin out the spots
she winks at the cops always give her props
she knows shes the woman cant nobody touch her
hangs out for the loot makes her papes from the gutter
tried to make my moves on miss lane she called me young boy
told her not to dis me i just want to be your love toy
you young boy my love toy i doubt that very highly
just because you rhyme dont mean ill let you try me
business oriented egos never dented
always sweet scented if its business she meant it
distractions never hurt always did the work
always was alert she never got jerked 
queen of the feats thrive to compete
love the funky beats while she drive down the street
she was justified couldnt get a job
had to feed her family so she had to play then rob
pullin out the ooh wop listenin to doo-wop
you dont have to say a word
gunshotsthats all ya heard

shes not a big kahuna wish i met her sooner
instead i met her later my love is much greater
put me on her roster to rid her of imposters
and to sell the buddah for the sexy drug ruler
love is my motive now im drug promotive
plus i needed duckets to fill up my buckets
supplied me with the squeezy to make my life easy
now im missing action for this fatal attraction
but dont you let me catch you with your joint up in these bitches
and dont you even dare to plan a plot upon my riches
cuz if you play me out i think ill let ya be
ill be damned if i let a brotha try to gas me
i played my cards well try to live swell
for the g i would sell cuz i was deep in hell
but then i really wasnt she had a fly cousin
who would give me booty on the side of my cutie
elaine she kinda new that i would do the do
but she didnt tear i did my work with care
thats all that really mattered he money never splattered
as long as she was paid she was in the shade
you cant really blame her for holdin on a flamer
society taught her but they didnt tame her
a ten clip salute hunny heres a troop
she will never stop until she reach the top
