[chorus]
weve got the jazz 8x

[verse 1 q-tip]
stern firm and young with a laid-back tongue
the aim is to succeed and achieve at 21
just like ringling brothers ill daze and astound
captivate the mass cause the prose is profound

do it for the strong we do it for the meek
boom it in your boom it in your boom it in your jeep
or your honda or your beemer or your legend or your benz
the rave of the town to your foes and your friends

so push it along trails we blaze
dont deserve the gong dont deserve the praise
the tranquility will make ya unball your fist
for we put hip-hop on a brand new twist

a brand new twist with the homie-alistic
so low-key that ya probably missed it
and yet its so loud that it stands in the crowd
when the guy takes the beat they bowed

so raise up squire adjust your attire
we have no time to wallow in the mire
if youre on a foreign path then let me do the lead
join in the essence of the cool-out breed

then cool out to the music cuz it makes ya feel serene
like the birds and the bees and all those groovy things
like getting stomach aches when ya gotta go to work
or staring into space when ya feelin berserk

i dont really mind if its over your head
cuz the job of resurrectors is to wake up the dead
so pay attention its not hard to decipher
and after the horns you can check out the phifer

[chorus]

[verse two phife]
competition dem phifer come sideway
but competition dey mus me come straightway
competition dem phifer come sideway
but competition dey mus me come straightway

hows about that it seems like its my turn again
all through the years my mike has been my best friend
i know some brothers wonder can phifer really kick it
some even wanna dis me but why sweat it

im all into my music cuz its how i make papes
tryin to make hits like kid capri mix tapes
me sweat another  i do my own thing
strictly hardcore tracks not a new jack swing

i grew up as a christian so to jah i give thanks
collect my banks listen to shabba ranks
i sing and chat i do all of that
its 1991 and i refuse to come wack

i take off my hat to other crews that intend to rock
but the low end theorys here its time to wreck shop
i got tip and shah so whom shall i fear
stop look and listen but please dont stare

so jet to the store and buy the lp
on jive/rca cassettes and cds
produced and arranged by the four-man crew
and oh shit skeff anslem he gets props too

make sure you have a system with some phat house speakers
so the new shit can rock from mars to massapequot
cuz where i come from quality is job one
and everybody up on linden know we get the job done

so peace to that crew and peace to this crew
bring on the tour well see you at a theatre nearest you

[verse three q-tip]
hey yo but wait back it up huh easy back it up
please let the abstract embellish on the cut

back and forth just like a cameo song
if you dig this joint then please come dance along
to the music cuz its done just for the rhyme
now i gotta scat and get mine underlined

the jazz the what  the jazz to move that ass
cuz the tribe originates that feelin of pizzazz
its the universal sound best to brothers on the ground
and the ones six below ya didnt have to go

some say that im a sinner cuz i once had an orgy
and sometimes for breakfast i eat grits and porgies
if this is a stinker then call me a stink i ask
what what what - check it out

all my peoples in queens ya dont stop
now all my peoples in brooklyn ya dont stop
and all my peoples uptown ya dont stop
that includes the bronx an harlem ya dont stop

now to that girl ramelle ya dont stop
i say because ladies first ya dont stop
and to the jbs ya dont stop
and de la soul ya dont stop

to my brand nubians ya dont stop
and to my leaders of the new ya dont stop
to my man large professor ya dont stop
pete rock for the beat ya dont stop

everybody in the place ya dont stop
ya keep it on to the rhythm ya dont stop
and last but not least on the sure shot
its the zulu nation
