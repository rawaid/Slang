its a fly love song

to the effect of nothing effective fronting
is what i dont allow so let me tell you something
i am a bon-a-fide
not too modest and not a lot of pride
soon to have a ride and a home to reside
if my momma is sick im by her beside
used to watch the show on channel 4 called riptide
wash my wears in-tide cause its too damn cold
out-tide thats how the runnings go
if there aint no dough then there aint no show
so take your roly poly fat promoter ass
to the chemical bank and get my cash
if you wanna see the people scream and laugh
you best quest you ask the quest you ask real fast
cause i dont wanna see em start buckin
throwin chairs in the air while you be duckin
what what  dont step to me with that
if you promotin the show make sure it aint wack
*sings*
or else im leaving let me tell you
im leaving *cut and scratched* let me tell you
im leaving *cut and scratched* let me tell you
your wack show

{q-tip}  yo man whassup with that
{phife}  yo dont sweat me
 cmon five hundred that was the deal
{q-tip}  cmon man dont try to play me out
{phife}  we dont need you sorry
{q-tip}  you know you need me
*drum roll*

and the abstract rapper says

i want chicken and orange juice dats whats on my rider
and my occasional potato by oreida
dont forget my pastry make sure theyre tasty
im not the type to be pushy or hasty
see im the type of bro thats reared in the ghetto
took a few shorts before
now the only ones i take are the ones that i wear
aint takin no shorts no more now
please act proper fore i call the crimestoppers
dont dip on the dough cause thats a no-no
make sure you count your money real slow
be alert look alive and act like ya know
its the 90s time to make moves
not the 80s do away withcha womb
so what  you got a crew
i got one too theyre called the brooklyn zoo
dont break fool lets be reserved and cool
we dont have to act like we in grade school
just make sure that were taken care of
and well do a fly show for ya bub check it out
