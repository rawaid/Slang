chorus 

verse one phife 

ayo who wanna pull on phifer long time no hear from 
suckers walkin around talking about they could get some 
but that pop is non cypher no can do 
and if you think im a dope then ask the other crew 
and i proceed to let you know exactly how to flow 
im not lawn doctor so just step off with the hoe 
oops my mistake i didnt know you went with her 
should i run down the line of the all the kids that done hit her 
dont be bitter i hear that honey resembles a critter 
i heard she likes to do one-one my man john ritter 
but back to the subject you cant catch wreck 
you must get respect to earn respect 
suckers think they could herb me cuz know i wear specks 
youre full of jokes but you your name aint flex 
i got the riches the bitches im large like a huxtable 
you think youre all that but youre girls quite doable 
yeah im tellin you g to back up off me 
im not a mad cohort but im not mr softee 
rappin is an art coming straight from the heart 
so forget the chart because the action can start 

chorus 

verse two q-tip 

where ya at to all my peoples with the funk 
im the undercover brother dump your hoe in the trunk 
save all the sad songs and the tearjerkers 
niggaz step back its the lyrical worker 
the poems that i create aint in paper back books 
the poems that i create are for hookers and the crooks 
my mental is excelling cuz i dabble in the books 
im not the one to front on so suboops-suboops 
yo i gets the pickens im such a damn dickens 
if you step to this then the plot just thickens 
ill run you around the track like a bunny and a dog 
to me your just another mc on the log 
a link on the chain fluid on the brain 
i boast of hype lyrics and yours are mundane 
see i cant maintain especially if you come back 
im the lyrical master blaster yeah i can do that 
i can also do your girl so leave the hoe at home 
cuz when i get done ill have her strung on bones 
its the no-joke pressure that elevates my mind 
makes me pick up and go when its time to drop my rhymes 
my title is locked the abstract poetic 
im in the idle mode but my energys kinetic 
so smooth and debonair especially for the ear 
gotta keep my thing in gear cuz its evident and clear 
that i will rock rock rock fades away
