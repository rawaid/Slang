chorus
now you caught my heart for the evening
kissed my cheek moved in you confused things
should i just sit out or come harder
help me find my way

messin me up my whole head
teasing me just like tisha did martin
now look at what you starting
school boy crush and it aint on the hush
the whole world see it but you cant
my peoples they complain sittin rave and rant
your name is out my mouth like a ancient chant
got me like a dog as i pause and pant

speaking of which got a leash and a wish just to rock you miss
make a militant move peep my strategy
end of the day youre not mad at me
not dealing with nobody now thats what you told me
i said hey yo its cool we could just be friendly
cause yo picture me messin it up
her mind i corrupt with the ill c-cups
shiiit im on my day off
bullshittin hopin that the day go slow
got me like a friend what confuses me though
its kisses when we breeze tell me what the deal yo

{chorus} 2x

now why you wanna go and do that love huh
making things for me towards you harder
killing me just when i think we there
you doubts the whole vibe and it floats in the air
tellin me bout next man
but next man aint the nigga wit the plans
who got your heart in mind
its about time that you just unwind

and let it just happen make it front-free
just sweat me like money paney
diggin you gettin inside of your stee
its the quest cat keepin you company
forever or however you want it

word word
now wait a minute ma before you dead into the curb
try to make impressions which is good not the herb
but it it it aint me and i i aint blurred
ima still just chill wit you
maybe thisll change if you change your view
if not then i guess it is cool
just keep to yourself and abide by the rules

shake it out now repeats

{chorus} repeat til end
