brother brother brother lucien youre like no other
listen very close cause i dont like to boast
instead ill tell the tale of a french who prevailed
through the mr crazy rabbits who were always on his tail
when in on sale your roomie starts to wail
get caught with stolen goods and you will go to jail
if you go to jail then who will pay the bail
theyll put you back to france on a ship with a sail
escargot lucien you eat snails
hey yo tip whats wrong with snails
from the zulu nation from a town called paris
came to america to find liberty
instead of finding pleasure all you found was misery
but listen lucien you have a friend in me
oh luck luck will drive your butt batty
next time you get some wheels make it a caddy
in terms of doing good i know you wish you really could
but listen brother man i really think you can
succeed with the breed of the brothers on your back
its the creme de la creme and you can bounce with that
itll take a minute rice so take my advice
trust in us and thus you trust in your life

are you ready lu this one is for you
comin from a true-blue fits like a shoe
cómo está usted or comment allez-vous
lucien ill leave it up to you
voulez-vous  vous
rendez-vous vous
coucou cou 
les poo-poo poo
watch that lass gonna backlash fast
can you get a grip on the crackhead dip
sold you a paper bag guess he saw you comin
vcr from a neck-bone bummin
$10 brother he was hummin and strummin
only had 20 he was livin like ya slummin
gave him the money well i thought that was somethin
lookin like a kid who was lost in crumbin
dont worry about a thing i wont get specific
this is a song that is long and prolific
think of the stuff that i said if you can
figure it out compute understand
no problemo ill help you with your demo
if you go to the store for me
lucien im just kiddin - you should know

q-tip
you gotta get a grip on the missions youll be takin
not so much the mission but you got crazy ignition
sure the sugar-babies wanna give you a chance
with the french savoir faire and the sexy dance
but is she really fly or is she a guy
i wont ask why cause i know that you try
you try too hard is that the answer to the riddle
instead of doin so much why dont you do just a little
boy what a cad i guess we shouldnt treat him bad
in fact it would be nice if we understood him like
a case of positionin the feet in the shoes
sympathetic reason in the case of the blues
lucien is blue even though hes really brown
i had to make the sound his life is too profound
on the up-and-up hes somethin like a little pup
young and naive its hard to believe
as long as youre strong you can quest with the questers
jolly like a jumping bean or a jester
lucien lucien lucien lucien - you should know
