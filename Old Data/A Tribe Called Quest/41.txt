oh my god - busta rhymes 16x

phife dawg
theres a million mcs that claim they want some
but see i create sounds that make your ears go numb
peace to sayers ave yeah you know how we go
my best friend steven at the home depot
lowerton is in the house i cant forget southside
walk past mcs like that girl did the pharcyde
im labeled as the cats meow the mc with the know-how
act like you know not now but right now
beast of the east on mcs i have a feast
id eat that ass like quiche crack a smile like shanice
straight out jamaica scene jamaica queens
but you could find me out in georgia or anywhere in between
now if my partners dont look good malik wont look good
if malik dont look good the quest wont look good
if the quest dont look good then queens wont look good
but since the sounds are universal new york wont look good
picture phife losin a battle come on get off it
put down the microphone son surrender forfeit
did i hear somethin bout a crew  what they wanna do
you better call mr babyface so he can bring out _the cool in you_
or itll be a sad love song being sung by toni braxton
and ill dissect you like a fraction
oh you wannabe top cat mcs ill pop you like a zit
you wanna be the champ you more like chief some-shit
big up myself everytime when it comes to this
mcs be runnin scared as if theyre watchin the exorcist
i kick more game than a crackhead from hempstead
my styles are milk man youd think that i was breast fed
you know the steelo when the diggy dawg is on the scene
i dedicate this to all the mcs outta queens 
that goes for onyx ll run-dmc
akinyele nasty nas and the extra p
