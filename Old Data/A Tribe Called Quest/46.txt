shaheed
its a new decade
the native tongues are about to proceed with the usual lingo
the usual rhythm

q-tip
devoted tothe art of moving butts
the rhythms happenin and its movin up
the tribe has been on hold for much too long
dont fear the rhythm because its strong
on the corners brothas bop their heads
from the high-tops to the knotty dreads
im a nubian yall look what we did
took the crust away from the third eye lid
now its kinda open longs to see the site
rhythms of the tribe which is passed out right
night after night day after day
questin for the rhythms of the native tongue lay
rhythm is the key as we open up the door
things a b-boy has never seen before
polyrhythmatic with a big fat boom
you have an eargasm as you start to consume
the ghetto beat with a ghetto poem
yeah its from the heart cuz its from the home
jarobi phife ali shaheed
call me koala got what you need
youre a disc jock then jock this
rhythms cant lose rhythms cant miss
if you feel uptight and you need to freak
itll be alright once we drop this beat

chorus
i got the rhythm you got the rhythm8x

q-tip
ma ma sa ah ma ma coo sa
gets hectic freak a bourgeios
we quest around for the musical hard
on the avenues streets and boulevard
not sellin out thats a negative
lovin hip hop lovin heritage
got the instinct to travel miles and miles
gotta whole lot of room for piles and piles
now youre kinda with it wanna get the funk
from the zulu nation toppin all the junk
standin on the top like the temptations said
rhythms are obese yeah you gotta keep em fed
read what i read cant be better said
tribalic motions dabble in the head
sweetbacks bad not as bad a beat
its a stone groove baby
continue on the windy road
but im luggin a crazy big load
will we be on point for the ninety deck
is it muscle bound and will it flex
but trudgin we are used to
you dont quest alone quest with a crew
were four once more must make the tracks
you see four fronts but now you see four backs

chorusunti end
