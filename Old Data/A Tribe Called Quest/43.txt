q-tip
the deadly venom let me start from the beginning
we always hittin so yo therell be no extra innings
as i send the mic out the park like reggie jackson
you be the minor leaguer who sees no action
the coming attractionwhat
the main feature
and im a greet ya like a rhymin ass creature
lurking all up in the dark unknown parts
the brotha well prepared is the brotha who will start
and thats me aqui as long as the ladies move they bodies
well have a forum to stand
cuz that happens to be the nature of man
sexuality it is the format baby
aint no ifs no buts no ands or maybes
but i praise lord in the worlds thats unseen
respect me for that and let me do my thingjust
i said respect me for that and let me do my thing

chorus
drifting byyou know we gotta get a hold
suddenly over the illest drum rolls
suddenly drifting by just

yo how you doin let me give you an intro
my names the abstract now let me give you some info 
got the diamond in the back and the sunroof shit
that makes the hardcore mcs resort to being bitch
and i dont give a shit about being wild rich
just make me comfortable and ill deal with it
your lust for the riches make a nigga feel sick
down to his zealots upchuck and then spit
denouncin my beliefs well then your wig get split
lay your ego on the ground so that youll benefit
you can take these words and relay it to your click
take some time for your mind and get off them head trips
dont try to play me see my names not dick
the tribe is the crew that makes your mics get lit
like the fourth of july on some firework shit
my record company be on some  true jerk shit
but thats i-ight now im on some true work shit
and ima make it happen for my whole outfit

chorus
drifting byyou know we got to get control
suddenlyover the illest drum rolls
suddenly drifting by justthird verse

a-yo we just gettin started
got to redirect this vision
got the beauty of a flower
plus dimensions like a prism 
your minds are locked down like prison
yall really need to go lay down
cuz positivity has risen
we hittin
yo bust how we too strong to be broken
occasional malfunction pressure time
we aint jokin
for security we on this run like logan
kamaals doin the hustle
and you backstage voguin
we all got flaws
dont ever try to think that you perfect
we all are human beings 
theres bullshit at the surface 
sometimes i mean we rhyme 
damn we aint prophets
and if you think so you need to stop it
so jump back inside your shell
let your million dollar thoughts propel
but next man dont get jel
playa hate that all carries weight 
that we dont need
we slim with disabilities and
thick with possibilities
cuz then you cant move with agility
navigatin with good visibility
we put these tunes out in record shop facilities
lets strive to get this constant money activity
we try to stay on the scene like fidel
so if you get enraged with these names it still rebels
there aint no plan bs 
yo watch we movin through with plan a
money market doin things the right way

chorus
suddenlyyou know we got to get control
drifting by justover the illest drum roll
suddenly drifting by justx3
suddenly justx2 drifting byx2 in background 
yo bust it out section section
section linden boulevard
section on merrick
section the whole jamaica
section on flushing
