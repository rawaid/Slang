q-tip
listen up everybody the bottom line
im a black intellect but unrefined
with precision like a bullet target bound
just livin like a hooker the harlett sounds
now when i say the harlett you know i mean the hott
v-a-v-a-vader the brothers in the spot
jalick jalick ya wind up ya hit
captain of the poets im the #7 pick
licks licks licks boy on your backside
licks licks licks boy on your backside
listen to the fader shaheed lets it glide
tip the earthly body heavens on my side
even in santo domingo can i gotta gringo
we got mikes when do we go
know a little nigga who can ryhme when you ask me
short dark and plus his voice is raspy

phife dawg
1 for the treble 2 for the bass
you know the style tip its time to flip this
i like my beats hard like two day old shit
steady eatin booty mcs like cheese grits
my man al b sure hes in effect mode
used to have a crush on dawn from en vogue
its not like honey dip would wanna get with me
but just in case i own more condoms then tlc
now the formula is this me tip and ali
for those who cant count it goes 1-2-3
the answer scratch damn right im censored batty boy hiccup is who i be
brothers find its hard to do but never me
some brothers try to dis my malik you seem ditchin me

chorus
oh my god yes oh my god 8x

q-tip
complimentary it be the theif of poetry
i got a humdinger comin hook line and sinker
the timbo hits with the prints underground
timbos on the toes i like the way its goin down
down like the lady of the evenin        
when it goes in toots just beleive the sin
cuz queens is the county jamaica is the place
take off your boots cuz you cant run the race

chorus
oh my god yes oh my god 14x
