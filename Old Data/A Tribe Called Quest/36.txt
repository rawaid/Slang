q-tip
q-tip is my title
i dont think that is vital for me to be your idol
but dig this recital
if you cant envision a brother who aint dissin
slingin this and that cause this and that was missin
instead its been injected the tribe has been perfected
oh yes its been selected the art makes it protected
afrocentric livin africans be givin
a lot to the cause cause the cause has been risen
some brothers they be flammin thinkin we aint slammin
comin off like the days where we used to wear the tans and
a blue-colllar talker a hemisphere stalker
a glass of oj and a ten mile walk-a
if youre in a jeep and you dig what youre hearin
can i get a beep and a side order of cheerin
i am what i am thats a tribal man
we all know the colours we all must stand
as we start our travels things they will unravel
que sera sera for this unit is like gravel
wont be gone for long listen to the song
if you cant pull it all ya gotta do is

chorus
push it along push it along
push it along yeah push it along repeat 4x

phife dawg
put one up for the phifer its time to decipher
the ills of the world make the situation lighter
the clock is always tickin the systems should be kickin
like  ham and eggs i eat chicken chicken chicken
should i release the lever the lever of the clever
embelish on the funk as we start to endeavour
the wraughts of the rap filling up the gap
with the smash of a hand and a little toe tap

q-tip
the boom the bip the boom bip
indicates to the brothers that we be on the flip tip
phonies start to crumble funky rhythm rumbles
through the dance-hall but my anthem is humble
its the nitty-gritty my time is itty-bitty
so i kick the slash for the gipper and the witty
this aint trial and error more like tribe and error
constantly rude as some sort of tribal terror
the street cant depart from the bloody heart
repair the wear and tear dont start fore it starts
wont be gone for long listen to the song
if you cant pull it all ya gotta do is

repeat chorus

q-tip
marchin off the project we hope that you will subject
its good to be an object and never ever reject
the tribe who meanders with drunken propoganda
keep it in boom and never will we slander
 should be handed dont let me demand it
money gives a nudge to the poet star bandit
control it then recluse it follow you wont lose it
mysterious is the tribe for we choose it
although shes flippin crazy give my love to gracy
god could you help cause this quest is crazy spacey
the pigs are wearin blue and in a year or two
well be goin up the creek in a great big canoe
what we gonna do save me and my brothers
hop inside the bed and pull over the covers
never will we do that and we aint tryin to rule that
we just want a slab of the ham dont you know black
this society of fake reality
are nothin but a peg of informality
while i sing my song sing it all day long
if you cant pull it all ya gotta do is

repeat chorus
