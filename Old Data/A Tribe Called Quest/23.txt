verse one phife dawg 

went to carvel to get a milk shake
this honey ripped me off for all my loot cakes
the car oh yeah theres money in my jacket
somebody broke into my ride and cold macked it
yo tip i tell you man the devils tryin it
but im goin to stay strong cause i aint buyin it
tonight im taking sherry out i dont have jack to wear
you know i gots to look dipped in the fresh new gear
cool i found something so i ironed it
i then got caught up on the phone oh shit im fryin it
will someone tell me what did i do to deserve this
i think ill pull out my suit for sunday service
my little brother wants barney cool im gettin it
took him down to kay-bee they aint sellin it
here we go with the cryin yo hes throwin fits
my blood pressures blowin up i cant take the shit
finally got what he wanted now hes good to go
again the ride was smashed wheres my radio
one time the car was in the shop i had to borrow see
they had no mercy on the car leo will kill me
where the hell can nicki be im gonna smack her up
i got the tickets for the knicks and she cold stood me up
i need to hit a honey off jarobi pass the phone
pulled out my book of hoes oh yo sheilas home
steady smilin like a mother yo im read to bone
went down to hon shes in the red zone
stressed out more than anyone could ever be
forever tryin to clear the samples for my new lp
everybody knows i go to georgia often
got on the flight and i ended up in boston
with all these trials and tribulations yo ive been affected 
and to top it off starks got ejected

refrain phife dawg

verse two phife dawg 

just last week my girl was stressin me
now her best friend be underssin me
well i was lovin her by the moon ray
now im tricking on her like kinte cmon
bought a bag of izm from the smoke shop
walkin towards the car here come the damn cops
now im station bound for the thai sticks
i bought it for my man i dont believe this shit
coach sat me down from the ball team
cause i was breakin niggaz on the inseams
some niggaz cross town was tryin to stick me
all i had was shorts a dollar fifty
picked up this girl in the hooptie
just because i rhyme she tried to soup me
pay for this pay for that loot for nails and hair
who the hell you think i am mr belvedere
go and get a bloody job then can we look cute
even if you give me boots youll neva see my loot
she wasnt even all of that just another hooker
so i turned that ass away quick like chucky booker
sometimes you got put the hoes in their friggin place
just move from in front me with your bati face
