verse one phife dawg

aiyyo swing swing swing to chop chop chop
yo thats the sound when mcs get mopped
dont come around town without the hip in your hop
cause when the shit hits the fan that assll get dropped
mcs wanna attack me but them punks cant cope
ill have you left without a job like isaac from the love boat
so money watch your mouth or i might have to bust ya
battlin mcs from jfk to russia
back down to london sweden and brazil
do a us tour for three months and then a chill
styles be fat like jackie gleason the rest be art carney
people love the dawg like the kids love barney
i love you you love me
the shorty phife dawg is your favorite mc
so move back yaself dread you know the element
the tribe is good for your health like a can of nutriment
mcs dont have no winds mcs dont have no winds
i flips you crazier than a busload of jerrys kids
your crew dont want it man your crew dont want it
but if you feel you can swing it then money please bring it
