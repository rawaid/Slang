intro

listen you fuckers you screwheads
heres a man who wont take it anymore
a man who stood up against
the scum the cunts the dogs the filth the shit
here is some one who stood up
here is

yeah hennessy for everyone music proudly presents
xzibit movin at the speed of life
yeah check it

verse one

it took a long time comin but we waited
xzibit went from underated
to now most anticipaded
never would of thought that i would rock your set
and get love and respect without no special effects
only the rugged ruff shit that the hard rock need
lyrics must contain more then just clothes bitches and weed
thinkin how you like to see the next man bleed
tryin to glority greed
livin life at ridiculuos speed
indeed the main goal to achieve is to succeed
have it laid out for your seed
but the world gets colder every day by day
physically mentally gettin drained by la
trying to find piece of mind
is like trying to find a gold mine
it just wont happen
no time for relaxin
real soldiers of fortune
the front line of the action
so never show a nigga what you packin
you know what im sayin
its too much weight to be juggling
who do you picture when you think about struggling
kids in the bed no food stomach bubblin
niggas in the e-class heavy drug smugglin

chorus

movinyeah
yes movin
at the speed of life

verse two

and plus i feel that no style is darker than mine
there was a time it was all about beats and rhymes
but nowadays the blind just follow the blind
and when i die
niggas still recite these lines
to rock the heads waterbeds citys and towns
bringin strength to the masses that be holdin it down
the underground to upper echelon and beyond
xzibit rock and roll the streets like a vagabond
nigga wanna trip you gettin dissed like a blond bitch
mackin to farrakhan i run game like a marathon
its here today then tomorrow its gone
its the law of the land
a straight modern day babylon

chorus

movinyeah yeah like this
like thisat the speed of life
ah bring it live yeah

verse three

xzibit lookin at the earth thru wide angles
i found a stairway to heaven in a city of lost angels
where small situations turn to altercation
with a heavy ass price
cause niggas dont fight no more
before hip hop was all about drama
anything for a dollar before kane fucked madona
xzibit maintain and stayed bent like a comma
just me and my bottle
we shall lead not follow
emcees be full of shit
but they style be hollow
it seems youve bitin off more
than you can possibly swallow
just a day in the life of a man named x
only blunt and latex for the opposite sex
you see niggas comin thru to smoke and pay respect
ever since fifteen i been ready for anything
whatever they bring in any shape form or fashion
i live to the fullest and rip rhyme with a passion
but in the mean while if worse comes to worst
bust a round or bust a verse whatever comes first
yeahwe got it locked down tight
xzibit bring truth to the light
shit is movin at the speed of life

chorus

movin
at the speed of life
