i float like big spirit in this bitch im ghostly
rush me cause you aint gonna live to roast me
id have my motherfuckin ass kicked by moby
if i let some bitch in the can like bis cop over me
to do war and try to bring my crew back down
ill never stoop to that level to do that now
i got a new cat this time im pullin two gats out
with bullets i finally got somethin to shoot at now

xzibit
lets see who got they city on lock
lets see who got the better aim with the glock
lets see who come out on top
lets see who really want they name in the streets
lets see who wanna die the same time as me
and make ends meet
now was i blessed with a gift or cursed with a curse
i follow hearse after hearse with verse after verse
and ill be damned if i let belly dance dupri
or anybody swing an axe at my family tree so now

i love it when you niggaz be talkin sayin my name
seems like your mouth is not connected to your brain
two-zero-zero-three and shit it aint the same

i dont wanna hear what you meant do not explain
right before you lay in your coffin hoe say my name

why do you hate me hate me i came from nothin
blood sweat and tears you did not create me
how can you doubt me doubt me you dont know shit about me
thered be no west coast without me
cut with the bullshit bullshit i struggle for survival
and now you tryin to act like my rival
watch what you say partner its a small earth
dont play games with your life nigga its not worth
all the pain all the pain all the agony all the agony
all the horror all the horror all the tragedy all the tragedy
put your hands up people its time to fight now
i beat holes in your chest remain hostile
threaten my life cmon one day youll understand
they say that pride is the sign of a foolish man
so who the fuck who the fuck you think you talkin to
live and direct in the flesh im right in front of you

i never really smashed on jermaines ass dre smashed him
nobody ganged up til he came back and jacked him
i never really brought it to his ass i tapped him
i coulda been like treach boom-bapped and slapped him
purple for mimickin him with two rappin urkels
i coulda snapped took it past rap and hurt you
but i didnt i kept it on wax and served you
i square dance cause im sick of rappin circles
around these clowns steady tryin to call me out
its like im listenin to motherfuckin dogs meow
youd probably do better tryin to come and stomp me out
you dont want it with rap this is what im all about - cmon
i no gangsta you aint either
will but i know that i spit ether
not i shoulda crossed your belly
lose show you im not r kelly
x pass me the weed ima put my ashes out on his ass
for the last time man {*scratched* - watch your fuckin mouth}
