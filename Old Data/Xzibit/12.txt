what u see is what u get
intro xzibit j-ro

speaking
and so it was written and after all these things
i saw another angel come down from heaven
having great power and the eath was lighted with his glory
and he cried mightily with the strong voice saying babylon the great has
fallen
its fallen and has become the habitation of devils
and the home to every fowl spirit and a cage of very unclean and hateful men

what you see is what you get now
xzibit never wait around for kick downs get my own shit blowe
shot heard around the world
