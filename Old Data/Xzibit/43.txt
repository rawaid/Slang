witness the downfall of men
i wanna kill you for your land i dont mean to kill the reactor
linking in japan i am here
got the gangsta for all your chain chains

march to the heart beat of the city
you only hear the drums when they audace and they see me
you know what time it is flavor with a thousand checks
its like the ice ring surrounds my neck

i never worry about the referee
the gate keepers keep him locked for me
push all to shallow forever
always will be underground x to the motherfucker z

fold it all for the money cant team where my gangstars at
hit the park build at the car scene
blowing red everywhere look how strong we are

so there will be no war or shots
im about to give my city boiling hot and make em pray for real
and make em say my name lit up more smoke
than a power water drill concentration determination
the very thin line between paradise and incarceration

gangsters gangsters
gangsters stand up and rap what youre claiming
police roll around shake us down always playing and i
gangsters gangsters
streets made me into this man gotta represent who i am

they say right before you day you
get the irry feeling of peace then walk into the light
my soul want me take it without a fight
she says she wanna spend the whole life
but she only got me here for one night

said its time better get it in
call your best friend im a call you wonder-twins
stop and go like red light traffic
innovation made it another classic we made it happen

and big hip hop want us gut cut
niggas dare too much than offense popped up
another game fucked up cause the lanes clocked up
but the content sucks

i wanna fill up some big red trucks
tour then through the whole world motherfuckers lining up
cause these tickets wont move like crap
youre tying west coast around my back
and yall niggas saying fuck it with that

gangsters gangsters
gangsters stand up and rap what youre claiming
police roll around shake us down always playing and i
gangsters gangsters
streets made me into this man gotta represent who i am

cant even rely on your own eyes
everything fake now toast to the bad guys
that will leave a whole class swimming with the fishes
part machine part skill part intuition

i cooked my first album in my fathers kitchen
he told me how to make a living twenty grand and half a chicken
now im shitting on myself and still i let him know
that if he turn me in a turn around it kill us both

this is a cold world but im a polar bear
destroy the earth like a silver flare best beware of us
in god we trust but everybody else gotta pay cash up front
caught there they try to tear me down

im on a level now i speak like i mean it
the focus study my literature
clean house taking out the trash
im in the fly zone where you past gangsa

gangsters gangsters
gangsters stand up and rap what youre claiming
police roll around shake us down always playing and i

streets made me into this man gotta represent who i am
