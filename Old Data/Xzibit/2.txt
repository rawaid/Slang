intro
yes
1996 disfunctional member of the alkohaliks family
its xzibit bring it live one time like this

sometimes i wonder if its all worth my while
xzibit stay versitile
with million dollar lifestyle
and i could feel it as a child growin up
the niggaz that was real and the niggaz that was scared as fuck
thats why xzibit only roll with a chosen few
you aint really real i can tell when i look at you
so ease off the trigga talk you aint killin shit
its not affecting me or the niggaz that im chillin with
i dont believe the hype or buy a woof tickets
nigga you make a gang of noise and never sing like a cricket
i guess thats why we never kick it
a lot of niggaz are soft and get tossed tryin to fuck with the liquid
how many niggaz do you know like this
always claimin that theyre riding but they really turn bitch
it dont make sense
either youre a soldier from the start
or an actor with a record deal tryin to play the part
like that

its a shame
niggaz in the rap game
only for the money and the fame
extra large
its a shame
niggaz in the rap game
only for the money and the fame
paparazzi 2x

i dont need no lights no cameras
just action god dammit
never no superstar im more like a planet
so my composure is kept while others start to sweat
emergin from the fog with my fucked up dialogue
try to live high on the hog leaves you bankrupt
and niggaz you spent it on would not give a fuck
now thats deep how deep its deeper than atlantis
home of the scandalous
big bad los angeles
dangerous vandelous
yo not to be trusted
so how the fuck is you hard
not being scared by the boulevard
im pulling that card and sayin gin motherfucker
flowin like liquid soak it in motherfucker
im breakin it down my sound surrounds like death
from the west
puttin whole counties to the test
its all in perspective
break a one-nine copy
this is for the niggaz gettin caught up in the paparazzi

its a shame
niggaz in the rap game
only for the money and the fame
extra large
its a shame
niggaz in the rap game
only for the money and the fame
paparazzi 2x

niggaz smoke stress and cross dress
but i just played it back
others going through schemes and pipe dreams
for a contract
real tightly rolled fuck em all how i feel
i made a cool half mil
before i had a record deal
therefore you look and stare like its magic
but too much of anything can make you a addict
when devils be startin static bring out the automatic
i set it off straight i spread hate then i vacate but wait
who dare to cross this path
yo ill do ya like math
cut with glass make a blood bath
so on behalf of all niggaz i get drunk with
smoke them blunts with
i dispose of your punk shit
keep it all in perspective
carbon copies gettin caught up in the paparazzi
once again its the liquidation crew and we return for you 
like this

its a shame
niggaz in the rap game
only for the money and the fame
extra large
its a shame
niggaz in the rap game
only for the money and the fame
paparazzi 2x
