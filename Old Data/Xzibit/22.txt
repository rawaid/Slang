aint a damn thing promised to ya
except living your life and dying one day im just being honest to ya
it take a whole lot just to get a little 
getting caught up in the middle 
the answer to life riddles never come that easy 
but it was easy to lead me but it wasnt easy to see me
get up off the block to the tv
and sell a couple million cds best believe me
you see these calluses on my soul 
couldnt let hate and paralysis take control
i pick you up when youre down till i cant no more
my name sting in your mouth like canker sores
been at war my whole life sleepless nights endless fights 
but still cant walk to the light
cuz my work aint finished on earth for what its worth
from the cradle to the hurst god and family first for real

somewhere in the heart of man somewhere within somewhere
there comes a time when he must understand when he must understand
the strong withstand the weak will fall the strong withstand the weak will fall
cuz tomorrow may not come at all tomorrow may not come at all

life aint long its more like a snap shot
you can have the top i live for the hop
never take a day im breathing on this planet for granted
time for change time for growth peace understandin
see when niggaz keep forcing my hand disturbing my plans
bringing out the soldier in a peaceful man
its like trying to build a house on sand; youll never get a solid foundation
one man can change the nation 
yo i put that on all creation
haitian jamaican african asian caucasian indian whatever your persuasion
this is the message time is of essence
especially when youre counting your blessings
lessons learned from the deepest of pain
its not a game keep my name out of your mouth and imma keep it the same ya dig
its a shame graduated to the rap game only to find out crack and rap was the same thing damn

somewhere in the heart of man somewhere within somewhere
there comes a time when he must understand when he must understand
the strong withstand the weak will fall the strong withstand the weak will fall
cuz tomorrow may not come at all tomorrow may not come at all

who got skill who got hussle 
who got their family with them who pay for their muscle
yo its all gonna come out in the wash the lost angel 
with dirty wings bullets ricochet off my halo
i lay low for no one i love my life
aint afraid of no hard work and sacrifice
was born twice through the life of my seed 
making sure he see a side of life i was never able to see
hitting home like ground zero
move over now peace to the real heroes still underground
i put it down for the homies that cant thats hard in the paint
im living proof its never too late to be straight
once in a while i go back to the main strip
and see the same niggaz still doing the same shit
and all i can do is increase the flow
put it out let it soak in and hope they grow cmon

somewhere in the heart of man somewhere within somewhere
there comes a time when he must understand when he must understand
the strong withstand the weak will fall the strong withstand the weak will fall
cuz tomorrow may not come at all tomorrow may not come at all

somewhere in the heart of man somewhere within somewhere
there comes a time when he must understand when he must understand
the strong withstand the weak will fall the strong withstand the weak will fall
cuz tomorrow may not come at all tomorrow may not come at all
