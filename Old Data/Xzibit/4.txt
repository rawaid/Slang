xzibit
its that millennium ridiculous flow i never let go
niggaz gettin knocked out is part of my show
let em know who they fuckin with yo a rhyme wrangler
tri-angular push-up the hillside strangler
dangle a nigga by the ankle off the balcony
now let his punk ass go look out below belowwww
its a tale of two cities come out when the sun go down
we officially not fuckin around
stuck in the ground fitted with a suit in a pine box
hah with my fresh pressed khakis in a slingshot
so heatbox all day in a nigga face
and all you bitches see the dick that you shoulda ate

chorus 2x xzibit *singing*
call it what you wanna call it
im a fuckin alkaholik
bring it if you really want it
aint gotta put no extras on it

erick sermon
yo im in the zone and lyrically gone
got the spot blown boom  oklahoma
watch the aroma catch those who love me
my underground dirty cats on dune buggies
i be the type to take your watch and flaunt it
kidnap t lewis and jimmy jam on it
yo i bang a nigga head til his neck pop
do a krs-one to a black cop
x and es out for cream
get the money while you stay broker than al bundy
uhh give it to yall in any given sunday
with j foxx name the spot make it hot
i hate e so much right now blow it down hooker bounce
come off the ropes like j snooka
*x* two fly motherfuckers you cant fuck widdit
backed by +open bar+ so yall forget it

chorus

j-ro
j-mcenroe cam smashin party crashin
i eat mcs like a ration
im sockin niggaz in they goatees
i leave you stiffer than that fool on my basketball trophies
im in the room with 10 gs countin ten gs
cause we need a bag of weed can you smell it
now we need ten dimes to blow on deez like wind chimes
time to close the blinds cause you all in mines
i bought a bottle for the session and did not share it
drink so much captain mo all i need is a parrot
you took the alkaholik challenge and lost your balance
you underground we under water drinkin liquid by the gallons

tash
slurred words double vision brain bustin head rushin
since im too drunk to walk i rock a party on crutches
and still rush the roughest mc who wanna get it
forget it its likwit tha liks and xzibit
ca-tash on the blast the final piece to the puzzle
i slap bitches on the ass i slap tits up out the muzzle
i shuffle with the microphone bang rhymes consistent
you whack and im ca-tash and thats the mother fuckin difference
for instance 21 and over set your clocks back
tick tock tick tock still standin where the rocks at
two-thousand-one we still young guns thats +restless+
thirty niggaz sixty hoes and thats the motherfuckin guestlist

chorus
