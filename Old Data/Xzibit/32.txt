i was on the block picturing blocks at fifteen
i remember underage drinking at sixteen
then my nuts in cali banging at seventeen
now i got everything bitch i got everything

my back was to the wall visited all after all all i had was me
just tenacity so we all leave with a sense of sweet
then everything i write around got a cotton seat
fuck yall dry saw off and done rapidly

partner now lets be honest aint got no good intentions
the upper tune is the dudes moving in my position
but im a heavy wait humble hitting the heavy bag
waiting for the day i stumble across your fucking ass

instead i push the work in chin up and chest out
picking the shit up where i left off
you went soft intention too tenant to deal with the los angel
i admit it i bull shit and gave you the wrong angle

now i have a seat at my table let me do you the business
diversify you millions you can leave off the entrance
make every revenue street flood to where it took me
and make that money stack higher than giraffes

i was on the block picturing blocks at fifteen
i remember underage drinking at sixteen
then my nuts in cali banging at seventeen
now i got everything bitch i got everything

i used to have a glock that i would shot to at backpack
so it will leave no shells at the scene where i was getting my kid back
yeah this for the homie whack rolled to and chopped up
on hard to make the west defined a united fund

beard big light it up waiting on that vending truck
so i can crush the corner welcome to california
where people fake it till they make it or take it with their hand gun
take your chances swing try to land one

now youre in the box like a sand some i march to the madness
my symphony deliver something classic
either you aint glad or you blast it jumped in or dragged it
either way you got to salute the flag who you want it with

i acknowledge honest with whole heart and integrity
people keep telling me im about to catch a felony
stage presence reminiscent of my flash back
gave my girl a son and my last name

i was on the block picturing blocks at fifteen
and i remember underage drinking at sixteen
then my nuts in cali banging at seventeen
now i got everything bitch i got everything

theyre talking about they locked up in a coop in the mansion
im saying you cant knock me off the square that i stand in
nobody gave me nothing this is just where i landed
cause now i got everything bitch i got everything

motherfucker i live in room that look like a drive-in
when i open my eyes a bunch of bitches play violins
nothing but respect when i walk to the lights in
because i kill everything bitch i kill everything

nothing ever compares with the spring of a free mind
find the most dangerous weapon ever acquired by mankind
using to fight for your freedom and oppress your oppressors
you mould them and lead them fuck the positive message

this is a lifetime allegiance boy youre down to the essence
theres no payment for passage my immaculate presence
make every revenue street flood look where it took me
and make that money stack high and you run a pussy

i was on the block picturing blocks at fifteen
i remember underage drinking at sixteen
then my nuts in cali banging at seventeen
now i got everything bitch i got everything

theyre talking about they locked up in a coop in the mansion
im saying you cant knock me off the square that i stand in
nobody gave me nothing this is just where i landed
cause now i got everything bitch i got everything
