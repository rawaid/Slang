everyday lead to late nights
bitches on my neck like a vampire appetite
homie pass me a light i got that master kush
gave birth to you bastards told your momma the bush

now here you are i see youre feeling strong
my prediction came here tripping you wont be living long
wait i said that wrong now lets negotiate
i wait my banner a piece wont you take the paper

pussy nigga you fake cant wait for the face to face
hit you with the cage back in place rip another page off the book of life
before tonight we gonna celebrate and smoke till we elevate
my motive for motivating my niggas come on

take a look at my eyes and tell me what do you see
im going forever be me never im forever a g
all this liquor i drink and then i smoke all this weed
smoking this weed smoking is good but i got what you need

a lot of niggas are changed and they be doing what i made
wont you change i want you stay the same
but ill always be the same ill always gonna keep it g
im going forever be me therefore im forever a g

its getting hard to survive the streets that eat you alive
dumping your body your cadaver is covered with flies
too much rats are trapped inside of your rapping
niggas actually laughing at your lights camera action

do you do you
whatever the fuck you think you gotta do
cause when i bring it to the whole court
putting up a play of stats while youre hanging with the roaches
and rats were way above that

now how youre loving that
beat the breaks off the back of that bitch
i cant breathe cant make it your bitch
cant believe how deep in your shit

before tonight we gonna celebrate and smoke till we elevate
my motive for motivating my niggas come on

take a look at my eyes and tell me what do you see
im going forever be me therefore im forever a g
all this liquor i drink and then i smoke all this weed
smoking this weed smoking is good but i got what you need

a lot of niggas are changed and they be doing what i made
wont you change i want you stay the same
but ill always be the same ill always gonna keep it g
im going forever be me therefore im forever a g

the greatest trip that devil ever put together
was that self destruction is better than striving for perfection
i see the down could crawl quickly spreading like gun infection
and miss it after live use your common sense as a weapon

if you only knew half of this shit that ive been through
shoulve been a screen play when i get to
more niggas away iet quit playing games in the middle
of the street fuck yall niggas gonna say to me

we dont play the games just play for keeps and now
back for the forth fly back to the back who was back with a tour bus
get it round the world for a few months
down dead way niggas gotta dumb trunk

before tonight we gonna celebrate and smoke till we elevate
my motive for motivating my niggas come on

take a look at my eyes and tell me what do you see
im going forever be me therefore im forever a g
all this liquor i drink and then i smoke all this weed
smoking this weed smoking is good but i got what you need

a lot of niggas are changed and they be doing what i made
wont you change i want you stay the same
but ill always be the same ill always gonna keep it g
im going forever be me therefore im forever a g
