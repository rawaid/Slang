intro xzibit j-ro

i really wish i could you know at twenty-one
youknowhatimsayinhe he yo yo
ima tell you exactly why i do the things
i do youknowhatim sayin
gotta carry the weight youknowhatimsayin
go ahead
yeah i break it down like this

verse one

you see i dont like to remenisce about the past
the lower class no clout livin hand to mouth
each and every wrong move the police keep count
make it real fuckin easy to get streched out
i was at the funeral when it all began
you know the painful transition from a boy to men
i lost sight of my mother at the age of nine
didnt understand death nearly lost my mind
but see life moves on and broke niggas cant change it
age ten new step family arrangement
at thirteen i started gettin hair on my dick
and noticed me and my sister were gettin treated like shit
i would forever be hit with anything in reach
then my father would proceed to go to church and preach
about forgiveness patience all the shit that he lacked
gettin jump when he said and the head gat cracked
physical contact was in form of a slap
at the age of fifteen xzibit now hit back
courtesy of my stepbrother who taught me to scrap
left the bitch on the ground with her eyes on black
ran away from the house of teresa and nate
into juvenile detention where i built up hate
i dont remember the date of the judical debate
but legally i was now in custody of the state

chorus

and niggas wonder why i sit up in the club and drink
say whats up to xzibit and i still dont speak
im trying to contemplate the next move to make
gotta find some way to release this hate

and niggas wonder why i sit up in the club and drink
say whats up to xzibit and i still dont speak
im trying to contemplate the next move to make
gotta find some way xzibit carry the weight

verse two

and that was worse then the treatment i was gettin at home
but only now i was fucked up plus all alone
my father talkin all crazy to me over the phone
turned age sixteen now on my own
started running with cats who carried gats cause they had too
with no hesitation lock load then blast you
without a hastle we in a town of hicks
fuckin all these chicks
sellin rock by the bricks
so we feelin like we mothafuckin nino brown
at the house when the mothafuckin man touched down
screamin demands let me see your goddamn hands now
atf cause of handguns and contraban
we never kept it in the house
so of course we clounded
only found one pistol took us all down town
we be out by the end of the afternoon
gettin drunk on the strip let the system boom
who would assume mr qk would chill with a wife
ty and matt caught bodies
now they spend there life behind bars
catchin scars that will not heal
niggas dont know the half about keepin it real

chorus 1 1/2
