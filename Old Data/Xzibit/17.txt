ima clean this whole shit out like colonics
with words put together better than sony electronics
king of the jungle humbly stay honest
eat with the lions swim with piranhas

gasoline the seam strike the match
inferno im too thorough nigga so stand back
i spit shine get mine and rip rhymes
and make my career take an incline

im strict with knives straight with razors
good with grenades and great with gauges
been around the world in a million stages
watch niggas bitch up and go through changes

i had guns before thugs was in fashion
i mashed out before niggas knew mashin
i knew terror before the plane started crashin
i got punch lines and niggas aint laughin

im gon be here after the smoke die down
insomnia style i wont lie down
fight the good fight dont need no help
keep your hands up defend yo self

move like i move and live life long
cant move up if ya heart not strong
getcha own shit cuz this shits mine
every time i spit i shine

cocksucka i preach what i practise back shit up
wrap this rap shit up still actin up
get found in a trunk of an acura
yall suck like jail and dracula

x turn up the heat increase the hatred
straight stone faced dont fuck wit gay shit
so i guess that means i cant fuck wit you now
two down let off vacate to new town

it feel like bishop and juice now
got a flame thrower thatll burn big holes through your goose down
rough sound same strong background
bet on black the big boys layin chips down

my whole train of thought is
to bully any mothafuckea wit problems and not get caught
i was blessed with life but i curse ta death
ima spit ta my very last breath - fuck yall

im gon be here after the smoke die down
insomnia style i wont lie down
fight the good fight dont need no help
keep your hands up defend yo self

move like i move and live life long
cant move up if ya heart not strong
getcha own shit cuz this shits mine
every time i spit i shine

let me give this a three second look i hit a million dollar target
you aint came up yet well nigga let me show ya
come across dope like planes and boats
like balloons filled with coke down a mexicans throat

you ever seen a man get smoked they shit on they self
their body shake for a second then it gets dissected
for evidence of the weapon and the people involved
let one nigga talk everybody gettin caught fa sho

i say that to say this what
if you cant handle the time then ride the bitch
might as well touch ya tail and jump the fence
castrate ya self expose the bitch

x go head up but fuck never ran from it
i got a gauge with buck shot that you cant stomach
you aint a killa you a album filla
you aint a soldier you a rap promoter game over

im gon be here after the smoke die down
insomnia style i wont lie down
fight the good fight dont need no help
keep your hands up defend yo self

move like i move and live life long
cant move up if ya heart not strong
getcha own shit cuz this shits mine
every time i spit i shine
