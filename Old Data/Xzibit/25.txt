yeah today the big day

xzibit
been here four years eleven months and twenty-nine hot ones
one more day and im a free man walkin
leavin from behind these gates i paid my debt to the state
and ever since they took the weights
wasnt much for a nigga to do but start thinkin
wishin i was back home drinkin every weekend
remember like its yesterday eight-teen andÂ 
i cant remember the letters i just wrote a lot of them
goin for a ride that i cannot stop
set up shop in cochran connect the dots
and for those that dont know thats the pen-east to fresno
northeast to baskersfield fuck lets make a deal
livin around niggaz who kill right along with the niggaz who will
at the drop of a hat sharpen up anything hard to stab you with that
niggaz givin up the manhood they cant get back
its a sick university murder the cirriculum
concrete campuses i miss los angeles
more than that im missin my kids
missin my turf missin my bitch what could be worse
shouldnt have asked that called the bitch collect its xzibit
some nigga picked up wanted to break her neck
when kites slide up under your door you slide them back
cause when you pick em up and read em thats where youre at
and if you aint rollin with that then watch your back
level four right away gettin hit the same day
playin the price for the games you play
never realize how precious time is til you give it away
cant remember what a t-bone taste like
i stayed awake nights listening to the sounds of prison life
motherfuckers cryin shanks gettin sharpened
tacs gettin taced up plottin and talkin
sellin everything from weed to blow
when its time for you to go youre the last to know
niggaz holdin weight essays got the power
locked down one shower every seventy-two hours
top ramen tuna trigger happy sharpshooters
waitin for the jump off cant wait to thump off
had to smash a nigga readin my shit
tryin to intercept my outside and write my bitch
i seen niggaz sleep for weeks get too weak
and then physically and mentally cannot compete
find new shit to master make the time move faster
home sweet home shipped off to land caster
kept a low pro close to home and im trippin
time to catch up with all the shit that i been missin
everybody runnin they mouth pussy to count
cause bitches in cali love niggaz thats freshed out
but some of these niggaz on swipe
gettin out with the virus caught from the nigga he liked
fuck that when i touch back i got plans
if i cant rock the powder rock the fans
give my naked pictures away shake some hands
hope i never seen none of you motherfuckers again
on all times take the long walk to the front gate
dress out expandin shit today my release date
