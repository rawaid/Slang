i open my eyes to the streets where i was raised as a man
and learned to use my hands for protection
in scuffles throw all my blows in doubles
im coming from queens motherfucker carrying guns in couples
and wilding a q-u soldier
from lefrak to rockaway back to queensbridge
black its only crack sales makin niggaz act like that
back in the days we could scrap now you lay on your back
as things changed with time i traded in my knuckles for a mac-10
and rather live the life of crime
with my bed-stuy connection connected in two
its live boo start shit too wild for you
peace to baesley forty-p get down
and when you outta town represent your ground
them niggaz bleed just like us so show em where we come from
queens; leavin niggaz done son

son get that loot quick spending dough like i never had shit
im living large pushin luxury cars
though that shit is outta reach anybody in my wake gets scarred
permanently bed-ridden
and if youre pussy then motherfucker get in where you fit in
as i walk around the streets
son i got mad beef ima blast you before you blast me
thats my philosophy cause nowadays you gotta be relentless
grab my mac and slap a nigga senseless
dont try to play me if you do you better doa me
son i got em shook grab a little baby for shields
you got drama run for shelter for real
pour some beer for the ill aint no time to chill
hit em up cause im quick to erupt like this
wet em up with the mac scratch em off my list
show em the real meaning of drama you never had it
til you bumped heads with the havoc
aint nuttin soft or sweat i lift you off your feet
when i cock back the heat whole crews retreat

prodigy

everything is real inside my mind; these days
you cant make it if you aint affiliated with crime
a lifetime of street living
throughout the beef ive accumulated many slugs have been given
but wilding aint the way to be living
youre only gonna end up bloody on a floor shivering
or locked up caught inside the beast
meanwhile on the street saying no more peace
my man sto-bo kid hold your own
in a cell locked down not far from home
and at the same time on the outside im representing
still packin heat make you cowards keep stepping
getting high its cause of the lye i cant lie
i could move the crowd poppin slugs in the sky
why come around if you afraid of whats over here
my man havoc put the bug in my ear
on the real for real but wait it gets realer
real like an innocent child that turn killer
its thing like that that only makes things iller
and makin cream doin sticks if you aint a drug dealer
its only facts coming out of my mouth feeds
as far as i can see these streets is getting sour
q u too much drama to get into
and niggaz regret when they begin to
regardless of your name or what you been through
pause for a second open your eyes and think dude
life aint the game that it seems to be
fuck a fantasy im leaving in reality
caught up in this untouchable mentality
hit you up bad make you loose a few calories
i need to slow down movin through life at a high speed
watchin all the slow runners pass by me
i can see through you due to my queens education
speaking in behalf of this drug-game nation
the foundation the queens nation
