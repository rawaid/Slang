yo the saga begins beget war
i draw first blood be the first to set it off
my cause tap all jaws lay down laws
we takin whats yours we do jerks rush the doors
here come the deez tryin to make breeze and guns toss
in full force my teamll go at your main source
were not tourists hit bosses and take hostage
your whole setup from the ground up we lock shit
blood flood your eye fuck up your optics
switch to killer instincts for niggaz pop shit
yo nigga noyd whats the topic  nine pound we rocked in
ninety-six strike back with more hot shit
illuminate my teamll glow like radiation
with no time for patient or complication
lets get it done right my click airtight
trapped in a never ending gunfight so niggaz lose stripes
or lose life jail niggaz sendin kites to the street
over some beef that wasnt fully cooked finish em off
well done meat that said twenty-two slug to your head
travel all the way down to your leg

chorus together

aiyyo its hell on earth whose next or gonna be first
the projects is front lines and the enemy is one time
i aint gotta tell you
its right in front of your eyes
repeat 2x

havoc
we wreck the qbc nigga rep yours its all love
milli stacked down heavenly guarded by hollow tip slug
then crack down on wannabe thugs adapt to gat sound
and bow down slow the fuck up see how my foul now
articulate hittin body parts to start shiftin shit
never hesitant its the crack game unlimited
summon rasta we can do this forever infinite
then reminesce twenty years later how we was gettin it
either with me go against the grain you better hit me
leggin me or robbin me niggaz better body me
cause its a small world and niggaz talkin like bitches
bitches singin like snitches pointin you out in pictures
cause she rep the qbc faithfully playa hatin me
all that bullshit is just makin me

if shorty set you up you better dead her i told you

hit you with shit thatll leave a loose nigga stiff
probably thick son i solved em
pulled him in my world then evolved him to chaos
walk the beat like around the way cops the average pitstop
qbcity godfather part iii gotti gambino
and ty nitty scarface rest in peace

chorus

prodigy
yo the heavy metal king hold big shit with spare clips
you seein clips when the mac spit your top got split
layin dead with open eyes close his eyelids
turn off his lights switch to darkness cause deep in the abyss
is street life blood on my kicks shit on my knife
youse the wild child kid cold turnin men into mice
i was born to take power leave my mark on this planet
the phantom of crime rap niggaz is left stranded
shut down your operation closed for business
leave a foul taste in your mouth like guinness
pow niggaz is found mia
we move like the special forces green beret
heavily around my throat i dont play
shit brand new back in eighty-nine the same way
the god p walk with a limp see but simply
to simplify shit no man can go against me
test me you must be bent g dont tempt me
i had this full clip for so long it needs to empty
the reason why it full for so long cause i dont waste shit
you probably hid blood in your mouth so you could taste it
quiet as kept i lay back and watch the world spin
i hear thugs claimin that they gonna rob the mobb
when they see us i tell you what black heres the issue
its a package deal you rob me you take this message
along with that i aint your average cat
fuck rap im tryin to make cream and thats that
whatever it takes however it gots to go down
four mikes on stage a motherfuckin four pound
speakers leakin out sound and niggaz leakin on the ground
i could truely care less the god will get his
regardless blow for blow lets find out who wear hardest
this rap artist used to be a stickup artist
sometimes i test myself see if i still got it
a live nigga stay on point never diss
regard shit or forget the essence from which i emerged
p is sick so save that bullshit for the burbs
live up to my word if i got beef niggaz comin in herds
we flush through your click get purged
