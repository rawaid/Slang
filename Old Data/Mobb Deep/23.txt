provoking niggas shittin all over niggas
you rollin thick but sure the mobb rollin thicker
get that liquor turn your back ice pick ya
but fuck that
stickin with the gat is quicker
scared to come around my corner you ass nigga
do a jaw way all day fake shit
what you gonna do outta town play bitch
and run like a faggot switch take the whole shit
and show the world dont sweat it baby girl
i gotta hem
and pull the gat like a stem
you all fucked up like a off beat blend
i send message that you couldnt read clear
try to play the front but you got stuck in the rear
take it as a letter but im not sincere

yo
this aint rap its bloodsport
your life cut short you fell short
pressures on high full court
my team form killer instincts and fire arms
dangerous stuff mines brainstorm wars
a life of a wild rebel who run wild
clik blaow-blaow nigga lay down blaow fool stay down
appear disappear a hydro cloud
while you running at the mouth a hundred miles im out
mobb deep style from the depths of hempstead
get ninjad
i creep quiet keep the live nigga inchin
listen who are you to throw your fist in
hit like a bitch run like a faggot an take the whole shit
thats it
i had to pass here with shit
its time for showtime lets see how deep things get
you want to talk tough and get all delinquent
you find yourself all bloodied up and shameded
me and my man pioneered this violent nigga rap shit
bust a gat give me no fear of that im laughin
whats up there lets take you there and touch something
im a maniac brainiac fanatic at that
capable of combat p counterattack
in some hot wheels sendin shots out the back
it was a foul way to go kicko
you know the ropes so
bloodsport motherfucker

ay yo the rockweiler
chew in chew out ass niggas pull em on your collar
and let the lights dimmin
and youll be swimmin in a puddle of reality juice
fatality too
this rap is the bitch you shouldnt marry the two
to the set of prenumtual
got paid in too comfortable
its all good we dont want to humble
and while you shinin in the spotlight
i got this dot right
the aimed right a stoplight
the trife life aint no part twos
when its over its over you hit
now send your soldierly stool



nigga bloodsport
