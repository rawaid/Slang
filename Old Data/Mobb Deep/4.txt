verse one prodigy

it all began on the street to the back of a blue police vehicle
next come the bookends the way things is looking
its friday you in for a long stay gettin shackled on the bus
first thing come monday hoping in your mind youll be released one day
but knowing home is a place youre not going for a long while
now youre up on the isle in a position that you aint got to refusing
to smile
but keep in mind theres a brighter day after your time spent
used to be wild but locked up you cant get bent
thought you could hack it now youre requesting pee see you fragile
it aint hard to see niggas like that dont associate with me
id rather get busy to the third degree
cause the war populations are
if this was the street my razor would be a mack demon
hit you up leave your whole face screaming what you in for kid
busting nuts taps heard of million street stories caught inside this trap
who are you to look at me with your eyes like that
wising up young blood before you make things escalate and i would hate
to set your crooked ass straight

chorus 

make your moves at night pack your heat in this warzone niggas is trife
runnin from one time aint no time to slip make one false move
and its a up north trip
livin the high life make your moves at night pack your heat in this warzone
niggas is trife runnin from one time aint no time to slip make one
false move and its a up north trip

verse two havoc

you tried to dip duck but still got bucked you talk too much shit
you should have kept your mouth shut all that gossip
motherfucker dont you know my glock kicks hollow tips
to your body mad toxic i fade you blow you with a rusty-ass razor
did you a favor tried to wet you but i grazed you
pop goes the glock when theres beef on the block chill for a while
make them think the beef stop then i creep like a thief in the night
its only right aint no turnin back its on tonight and if i get caught
then my ass is up north straight on the course for upstate new york
stress smokin back to back cigaretttes it popped off gon point in
the mess hall
but to avoid that from head to toe dipped in all black hit them niggas
where they pump they cracks at havoc with the murder masterplan
keep my nine up to par so my shit wont jam god forbid if my shit do
run behind a tree fix my shit then hit you slugs in your body
mainly in your brain tissue witness from the scene get ghost stash
the pistol
so simple then watch my back lay up and relax roll a sackÂ k-a black
find a shorty intact

chorus

verse three prodigy

i got the powder combine wit the powder and water it oughtta
drop in a half and hour in the form of oil watch the cocaine boil
keep my eye on it so the shit wont spoil then i pause
and ask god why did he put me on the serve just so i could die
i sit back and build on all the things i did wrong why im still breathing
and all my friends gone i try not to dwell on the subject for a while
cause i might get stuck in this corrupt lifestyle but my
heart pumps foul blood through my arteries and i cant turn it back
its a part of me too late for cryin im a grown man struggling
to reach the next level of life without fumbling down to folding
i got no shoulder to lean on but my own all alone in this danger zone
time waits for no man the streets grow worse fuck the whole world kid
my money comes first cause im out for the gusto and trust nobody
if youre not family then you die by me cause niggas will have you
locked up
the snitch be a man givin police the run down on your plans
were never goin down like that so i shut my mouth and hold my words back
the legal business forever mine fuck payin taxes the last kid that shitted

and gave police access to my blueprints used names as evidence
skipped town and i havent seen the snitch nigga ever since
the moral of the story is easy to figure out a lesson that you cant
live without

repeat chorus once
*livin the high life
