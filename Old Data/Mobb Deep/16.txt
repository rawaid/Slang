[chorus]
as time goes by an eye for an eye
we in this together son your beef is mines
so long as the sun shines to light up the sky
we in this together son your beef is mines

let me start from the beginning at the top of the list
knowhatimean have a situation like this
another war story from a thirsty young hustler
wont trust ya id rather bust ya and leave your corpse
for the cops to discover while i be dippin in the range rover
all jewelled like liberace

you watch me while jakes tryin to knock me and lock me
but ill be on the low sippin asti spumante
niggaz try to creep on the side of my jeep
stuck the heat through the window rocked they ass to sleep
over a 3-pack it was a small thing really yeah
but keep lettin them small things slide and be a failure

if im out of town one of my crewll take care of ya
the world is ours and your teams inferior
you wanna bust caps i get all up in your area
kidnap your children make the situation scarier
life is a gamble we scramble for money
i might crack a smile but aint a damn thing funny

im caught up in the dirt where your hands get muddy
plus the outcome turns out to be lovely
got gs in my pocket hit off my main squeeze
push back the sunroof let the cold air breeze
through the butter soft leather upholestry
but mostly keep the gat closely cuz niggaz wanna toast me

yo i gotta get mines no matter what the con-sequences
count up my blessings add up my weapons
cock back the gat and let my nine serve purpose
sling do my thing organize fiend servants
tryin to make a mil is stress you know the deal
so we sling drills get your cap peeled cuz everything is real
cause i wanna chill laid up in a jacuzzi

sippin bubbly with my fingers on the uzi
try to infiltrate my fort get caught
dead up in new york my brain is packed with criminal thoughts
get your life lost never found again my friend
mission completed watch you drop in less than ten

on my road to the riches hittin snitches off with mad stitches
your last restin placell be a ditch kid
no one can stop me try your styles sloppy
want to be me youre just an imitation copy
my theme is all about making the green
livin up in luxury pushin phat whips and livin comfortably

[chorus]

a drug dealers dream
stash cream keys on a triple beam
five hundred sl green ninety-five nickle gleam
condominium thug dressed like a gentleman
tailor made ostrich chanel for my women friend
murderin numbers on your head while im burglarin
shank is servin em whassup to all my niggaz swervin in
new york metropolis the bridge brings apocalypse

shoot at the clouds feels like the holy beast is watchin us
mad man my sanity is goin like an hourglass
gun inside my bad hand i sliced tryin to bag grams
i got hoes that used to milk you
niggaz who couldve killed you
is down with my ill crew of psychoes
nas escobar movin on your weak production
pumpin corruption in the third world we just bustin

hold up and analyze the wildcats slang cracks
they swing an axe the new routines be my eyes blacks
playin corners glancin all up in your cornea
corner ya seen cats snatch monies up on ya
but late night candlelight fiend with a crack right
its only right feelin higher than an airplane right
word yo i want to get this money then blow

take my time blast a nine if you front you go
sip beers the german ones hand my guns to sons
shaolin and queensbridge we robbin niggaz for fun
but still write my will out to my seeds then build
mahalia sing a tale but the real we still kill

[chorus x2]

uhhh
lay back
word up just bless em
with the bulletproof
mobb deep nas chef creation
for your nation
yeah
