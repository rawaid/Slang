forever wild from the cradle to the grave
kid watch your back one time its comin always
they lock me up for 12 days i cant comprehend
now im a free man on the streets again
chasin st ides down with some seagrams gin
life is like a dice game and im into win
on the scene from the 41st side of queens
we get the cream laid up love love for dame
cause i mean what i meanim out to claim king
doin my thing do wild stakes my namell reign

to all my peoples locked down comin back to life
in the world once again though ya fear was trife
while you was gone we was goin to war and even more
saw my man layin dead on the floor kid i swore
that our crew will live forever i guess i was wrong
no until we meet againhold ya head and stay strong yeah
yogot my mind on a place to hide from policewhere
sweatin dogs as im runnin cross 12th street
just as i approach the block
i spot a jake on the creep down by vicks weed spotso what
made a you-ey up the hill plus a change of plans
i had to hurry back so i could warn my man

ya had me stressin little son had my heart rapidly pumpin
niggas start a guttin behind the bushes duckin
my ears rungi punch a clip into the guns
got in the arm one slug hit my son
he was bleedin from the head i couldnt believe it
we was defeated if it was a case i couldnt beat it
felt like cryin the temperatures risin
i saw my man helpless damn near on the verge of dyin
so to p i passed the iron

kid you aint lyin
i went to stash the murder weapon plus im relyin
on a door to be open goin in the building its a trap
police buckin at me they try to twist my tongue back
jetted up the staircase to the third floor
reached behind the sink throw the heater on the floor
locked the door police grabbed me up and tried to break my jaw
so wheres the gun we saw i dont know
we know you was there at the homicide scene i know nuttin
and if it wasnt you was somebody from ya team

[chrous]
from the cradle to the grave
from the cradle to the grave

[repeat x2]
straight from the motherfuckin cradle to the grave

yo its the real drama kills nobody moves stand still
bottle you drop that ass off in a land fill
son bless me with the iron i got beef
with some niggas from the other side over some weak shit
load up the heaters greet em with the hollow tips
flip em like the gotti clip my crew shift the body shift
the cradle to the grave is where ill end up
fuck gettin sent up north son im better
doin my dirt on a low
fuckin wit them mobbers like a crowd
no doubt you gonna blow you never know
he didnt even have to go there
unprepared now hes six below
why know im chillini gots no time for catchin feelings
get that money i wants some brothers want to act funny
but its all good i still die for the hood

for my peoples yeah knock on wood
triple l rollin dice while i put you on
to the drama what i gotta say is short not long
this nigga that im beginning to dislike he got me fed
if he doesnt discontinue his bullshit he might be dead
know him well and probably go way back
but i dont care if hes your man doin shit like that
i hope the word gets back to him cause i screw him
he shitted on my man and we got plans to do him
lets get it over with quickim tired of waitin
aint no fair overhead there we just debatin on when and how
later on right now spoke to killa yesterday

he said to chill for a while
but its hard acting like everything is alright
i get the chills when i see that nigga in my sight
a dead man walking not only that hes still talkinabout what
about how what he did buried off and you dont know
how much i fiend to put his ass in a coffin
one day my man and the next hes not
didnt know him long anyway so fuck it
its funny how things changeword up

[chorus]

word up man
why know what im sayin we gonna die
its for real kid no games bein played
