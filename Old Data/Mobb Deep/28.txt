havoc
sometimes i wish i had three different faces
im going to court for three cases in three places
one in queens manhattan one in brooklyn
the way things is looking im ma see central bookings
facing 3 3 to 9 is mad time
after reconcurrence for assault 2 9
i gotta maintain cause stress on the brain
can lead to a mothefucka suicide thing
and plus my provation a ill violation
how the fuck did i get in this tight situation
im going all out you know moves i never fake
and fuck the jake digger catch me at my way
and if i did burn a bag of blade
put the light in the air sometimes i just dont care

prodigy
son i got plans power movements get on some real shit
i keep living like this i might loose it
my man is coming home from doing long ass bids
what up kiko i aint seen your ass since we was kids
its all strange my niggas locked down thinking long range
and see their names in the daily news third page
they sent a kite to my nigga killa
it only took one sword to put seven holes in his squila
a 3 to 9 spending most of his time inside the bin
reclined and still came home with a shine
