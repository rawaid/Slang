i got my clique ready ready for hand-to-hand combo
harms break em down rapper noyd cut his throat
don swoop em up or gotti stomp em out
each twin grab a arm pick this nigga up
knitty turn his face to me let me break him up
i throw him up against the wall and put a hole in his face so big
it almost took his whole face off
we got to take position ready for faceoff
with blitz like dallas aint no superbowl faceoff
we form like niggas in the yard up north
with long swords ready for war who paid cost
and take ya life lost never found again boss
a job well done relax throw back fifths
of bacardi limon fifteenths of hash get lit
fuckin with the fabulous mobb yeah you were sick
lunatic nigga jump up or got hit 
with max and teks and silencers spit
shots whiz past your earlobe and shit
thats the sound of a nigga who almost felt it
got you runnin dodgin coverin shelterin
bullets rippin thru the fabric of ya shirt its meltin it
you bleed again we just another nigga dealt with
intruder alert our house is nothin like the covenant
we hold big shit like a bitch hold one in the oven

well if it aint drama money above broke bitches
simple minded niggas alpha have it positioned
thats opposition wetttin me competition
suddenly and outta tha blue and now i see
by myself by myself and rollin mad trees
paranoid on point and now i see whos who
this thing was fake ones outta the immediate crew
life i take one if you jeopardise my do
youre small mi-nute gotta death to deal with aces up
you overbidded and in the bridge you go stuck
this aint a card game but in perspective its the same
put two and two together-mobb deep with one name
contain drama like outbreak you order drama
we outtake and then take you out
keep it real and throw the fake out
raise the stakes up hit you off from the waste up
thats how it is and how it is is kinda fucked up
butter beats bangin got ya whole clique singin
on a corner while its rainin 4 pound left cha ears ringin
delete those and keep my shit discrete niggas is trash rhyme
totally offbeat and outta sync with they light
e &amp; j bent tight niggas slow ya roll
yaÂ  now ya bleedin tonight for no reason
wanna be max and does get smacked show no love
crush ya team like the bear hug
the infamousll do dirt dead as smear like mud
new york new get-it-greens i feel no pity
no remorse takin it to the source of course
bare that ass thug real kid its only your mask
that you wear take off
cop out feel the blast boom on top boom boom gat-for-gat
and all the rules got the drop on you
and let the nickel nine pop on you

prodigy

yo
my crew in the front got it locked
my live niggas in the back got the gats blowin outcha back
what the deal what them tough looks and eye contact
starin all up in ya cornea ya cornea lack
the look of a true-to-life crime niggas attack
go at the first nigga that front and overread
ya get dealt with

chorus

dealt with quick
eye position get melted by hot shit he felt it
