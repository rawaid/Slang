prodigy
its just another day drownin my troubles with a forty
thats when i got the call from this brownskin shorty
she asked me wheres my crew at  said we could do whatever
she got her crew too and said that we should get together
i said aight -- just call me back in a hour
so i can take a shower and gather up the manpower
then i hung up the horn
and i thought to myself that it might be on
cause this trick aint pick up the phone to call me in years why
ever since i left the hoe lonely in tears
aint no tellin what her friends puttin up in her ears
ideas of settin me up im not tryin ta hear
check it out son  so we take the gats for precautions
plus this trick live in brooklyn home of the coffin
she might got a whole batallion of bucktowners
waitin for us to get up off the train and surround us
or maybe im blowin this shit out of proportion
but this shit do happen to niggaz very often
so fuck it a nigga gotta do what he meant to
my crew got my back fuck the world is my mental
we put together five soldiers the bitch called
my blood curdled told me to meet her on myrtle
got to the plaza were waitin for the g train
we put a plan together just in case the beef came
now we bed stuy bound
far from home and on unknown ground
but together we six deep with fire piece nuttin sweet
first nigga frontin gettin lifted off his fuckin feet
it took eternity we reached our destination
my heartbeat is racin like a cardiac patient
we finally got to myrtle outside the train station
i saw not a soul told my peoples to be patient
but hold up thats when a black caravan rolled up
my legs then froze up i grabbed my pound
told my man eyes open cause it might go down
said he dont like the way the shit is startin to sound
evey angle of the car was smoked out and tinted
so we couldnt tell if the enemy was in it
it mighta been tnt i wasnt tryin to wait and see we
jetted thru marcy cause dees aint baggin me
word son they got us on the run dunn see yo

chorus

sippin hennessey with my mind on some crime shit
one-time searchin me but never ever find shit
its the everyday get the loot then breeze
though my goal is to leave outta state push kis
but all this bullshit holdin me down i cant leave
fuck a 9-to-5 i get the loot with ease
dont even need a degree to earn a six-digit figure
i get mines slingin on the corner with my niggaz
pullin the trigger when the drama appears 
cause that nigga worse enemy is fear
so yo

chorus

no doubt so what can kill you is what you dont know
ad lib to outro
