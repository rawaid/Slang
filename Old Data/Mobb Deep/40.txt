awright now pay attention to the crime rhyme houdini p
keepin you niggaz in perspective
mobb representative call me the specialist
professional professor at this rap science
up in the labratory heres why your small rhyme bore me
store bought rap aint shit my category
is that of an insane who strike back what
i draw first blood its over with and thats that
you wanna square off forsake and slice that cat
you get splashed from back of your head to ass crack
surgical signs to the end with iron map
which bring apocalypse to this game called rap
not a game but quite serious and yo in fact
youll be runnin for dear life so far you might fall off the map
fuckin with p you need a gat
at least to have the opportunity to bust back
first shot the motherfucker pack around world premier
shook individual bound from blind fear
scared to death niggaz fall to they worst fear
my retails in braille for vision impaired
you lookin for p well you can find him everywhere
in a project near you ill be right there
i was brought up and taught to have no fear now
live wire niggaz stay behind me in the rear now
cowardly hearts step aside stand clear fear
my bloodthirsty niggaz got they eyes on you
qbc lime bacardia god father pt iii
on some hashish to embassy suite crash your party

chorus repeat 2x

verse two havoc

yeah yo lime bacardi gettin bent crash the party
handle b-i bringin it to anybody
physical damage crowd control handle cannons
hittin you ripped leave your bloodstream contamin-ed
while you actin out of character we observin
drillin em down so hard i know we felt you comin at em
hennessee raps float like the phantom
runnin you up out of the spot in which you standin
never second-guess a cat who hold gat
concealed but easily revealed and fast
body castin raps to get your back snapped in half
and severed impossible pain beyond measure
sheisty living brought him to his last bread bread
life changed around quick to one stead stead
face full of fear conquerin your ice grill grill
tragedies put him to sleep like nyquil nyquil
givin a overdose of this rap potent
potentially dangerous fatally left open
for the roaches scavengers thats ems
funeral homes anticipatin your death
thats the dead truth check in the morgue youll find proof
enough to make you think and stop before your ship sink
to the bottom night owl leave the mark and spot him
you know the routine face up before i shot him

chorus repeat 4x
