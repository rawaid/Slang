check it out now
word up say it to them niggas check this out its a murda

prodigy
i got you stuck off the realness
we be the infamous - you heard of us
official queensbridge murderers
the mobb comes equipped with warfare beware
of my crime family who got nuff shots to share
for all of those who wanna profile and pose
rock you in your face stab your brain wit your nosebone
you all alone in these streets cousin
every man for theyself in this land we be gunnin
and keep them shook crews runnin like they supposed to
they come around but they never come close to
i can see it inside ya face youre in the wrong place
cowards like you just get theyre whole body laced up
with bullet holes and such
speak the wrong words man and you will get touched
you can put your whole army against my team and
i guarantee you itll be your very last time breathin
your simple words just dont move me youre minor were major 
you all up in the game and dont deserve to be a player
dont make me have to call your name out; your crew is featherweight 
my gunshotsll make you levitate
im only nineteen but my mind is old
and when the things get for real my warm heart turns cold
another nigga deceased another story gets told
it aint nothin really hey yo dun spark the phillie
so i can get my mind off these yellowbacked niggas
why they still alive i dont know go figure
meanwhile back in queens the realness is foundation
if i die i couldnt choose a better location
when the slugs penetrate you feel a burning sensation
getting closer to god in a tight situation now
now take these words home and think it through
or the next rhyme i write might be about you

chorus
son they shook
cause aint no such things as halfway crooks
scared to death scared to look 
they shook
cause aint no such things as halfway crooks
scared to death scared to look 

livin the live that of diamonds and guns
theres numerous ways you can choose to earn fundsearn funds
some of em get shot locked down and turn nuns
cowardly hearts end straight up shook onesshook ones
he aint a crook son hes just a shook oneshook one

havoc
for every rhyme i write its 25 to life
yo its a must the gats we trust safeguardin my life
aint no time for hesitation that only leads to incarceration
you dont know me theres no relation
queensbridge niggas dont play i dont got time 
for your petty thinking mind son im bigga than those 
claimin that you pack heat but youre scared to hold
and when the smoke clears youll be left with one in your dome
13 years in the projects my mentality is what kid
you talk a good one but you dont want it
sometimes i wonder do i deserve to live
or am i going to burn in hell for all the things i did
no time to dwell on that cause my brain reacts
front if you want kid lay on your back
i dont fake that kid you know i bring it to you live
stay in a childs place kid you out o line
criminal minds thirsty for recognition
im sippin; e&amp;j got my mind flippin
im buggin; think im how bizarre to hold my hustlin
get that loot kid you know my function
cause long as im alive ima live illegal
and once i get on ima put on on my people
react mix to lyrics like macks i hit your dome up
when i roll up dont be caught sleepin cause im creepin

chorus

son they shook
cause aint no such things as halfway crooks
scared to death and scared to look 
hes just a shook one
they shook
cause aint no such things as halfway crooks
scared to death and scared to look
we live the live that of diamonds

they shook
cause aint no such things as halfway crooks
scared to death and scared to look
they shook
cause aint no such things as halfway crooks crooks

livin the live that of diamonds and guns
theres numerous ways you can choose to earn fundsearn funds
but some of em get shot locked down and turn nuns
cowardly hearts end straight up shook onesshook ones
