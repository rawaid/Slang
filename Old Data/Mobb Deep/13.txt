yea yea check it out
now run for your life or you wanna get your heat whatever
we can die together
as long as i send your maggot ass to the esscense
i dont give a fuk about my prescence
im lost in the blocks of hate and cant wait
for the next crab nigga to step and meet fate
im lethal when i see you there is no sequel
24-7 mac 11 is my people
so why you wanna end your little life like this
cuz now you bump head wit kids thats lifeless
i live by the day only if i survive the last night
damn right i aint trying to fight
we can settle this like some grown men on the concrete floor
my slugs will put a stop to your hardcore
ways of action i grab the gat and
aint no turning back when i start blasting
pick up the handle and insert the potion
cock the shit back in a calm like motion
no signs of anger or fear cuz you the one in danger
never share your plans wit a stranger word is born

chorus
i put the glock on you kid now i got you
you got the heart to get busy without your crew
lets get it on nigga do what we gotta do
you bucking me im bucking right back at you

chorus

havoc
fuk where youre at kid its where youre from
cuz where im from niggaz pack nuthin but the big guns
around my way niggaz dont got no remorse for out of towners
come through fronting and get stuffed wit the 3 pounder
the loud sounder ear ringer
and im a point the finger on all you wannabe gun slingers
you got a real ice grill but are you really real
step to the hill and im a test your gun skills
cuz real niggaz dont try to profile
you just a chump who needs to get drunk to buckwhyle
but swing that bullshit this way
and im a make your visit to the bridge a muthafuking short stay
queensbridge thats where im from
the place where stars are born and phony rappers get done
6 blocks and you might not make it through
what you gonna do when my whole crew is blazing at you
wit macs and tecs to lend to get your dome crush
you thought that you could come around my way you big stupid fuk
what the hell you smoking what the fuk possessed you
to come out your face now i have to wet you
throw on my tims black mask and black serpent
twist a nigga cap then jump in the j-30

chorus

rae and ghostface
whos the richest nigga in the project who got it live
rocking convertibles frop tops and mad high
peace to that whiz kid and playas on his team
whos organize all eyeballs is on cream
and yyour whole clique got nuthin but raw shit
whip after whip stay flashing your dick on tricks
your whole crews ravishing teams untouchable
in the jungle banging nas mobb deep and wu
theres money out there guns catch crumbs those are your sons
jums is in the mailboxes bitches holding your guns
you know whats out there thousands of gram wrapped in siran
sealed tight keep the freshness thats how we expand
masked avenger drop your gun son now surrender
get ninjaed on the island plus the bridge boy remember

big noyd
my little thugs selling drugs and hes struggling
the game got him bugging i tried to tell him slow down cousin
but he vexed and niggaz getting wet up in the projects
but wit no doubt shorties out for his respect
but is his brain insane from the lye
from smoking that 118 chiny tye
why a nigga just died last week
as he swore he was growing hes a thug in the street
but its like that my crew pump cracks and we pack mac
his eyes is wild wit the rezzy monkey on his back
but im stressed and he need to be blessed
wit a firepack dont even go there cuz it aint like that
slow down baby he said what you trying to play me
you must be crazy pulled out the heat and almost blazed me
then he was swayze the shot must of dazed me
thugs selling drug busting slugs but he aint crazy
