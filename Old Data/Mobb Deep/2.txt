yeah sendin this one out to my man killa b
no doubt indeed without weed knowhatimsayin 
that old real shit

prodigy
theres a war goin on outside no man is safe from
you could run but you cant hide forever
from these streets that we done took
you walkin witcha head down scared to look
you shook cause aint no such things as halfway crooks
they never around when the beef cooks in my part of town
its similar to vietnam
now we all grown up and old and beyond the cops control
they better have the riot gear ready
tryin to bag me and get rocked steady
by the mac one-double i touch you
and leave you with not much to go home wit
my skin is thick cause i be up in the mix of action
if im not at home puffin lye relaxin
new york got a nigga depressed
so i wear a slug-proof underneath my guess
god bless my soul before i put my foot down and begin to stroll
and to the drama i built and all unfinished beef
you will soon be killed put us together
its like mixin vodka and milk
im goin out blastin takin my enemies with me
and if not they scarred so they will never forget me
lord forgive me the hennesey got me not knowin how to act
im fallin and i cant turn back
or maybe its the words from my man killa black
that i cant say so its left a untold fact until my death
my goals to stay alive
survival of the fit only the strong survive

chorus mobb deep

yo yo
we livin this til the day that we die
survival of the fit only the strong survive
we still livin it
we livin this til the day that we die
survival of the fit only the strong survive
thug life we still livin it
we livin this til the day that we die
survival of the fit only the strong survive
we still livin it
we livin this til the day that we die
we livin this til the day that we die
survival of the fit only the strong survive
survival of the fit only the strong

havoc
im trapped in between two worlds tryin to get dough yknow
when the dough get low the jewels go but never that
as long as fiends smoke crack
ill be on the block hustlin countin my stacks
no doubt watchin my back and proceed with caution
five-oh lurkin no time to get lost in -- the system
niggaz usin fake names to get out quick
my brother did it and got bagged with two ounces
i-llegal world where squads hit the block hard
ask my man twin when he got bagged that fucked me up god
but shit happens for a reason
you find out whos your true peoples when youre upstate bleedin
you cant find a shorty to troop your bid witchu
hit wit a 2 to 4 its difficult
wild on the streets i try to maintain
tight with my loot cause hoes like to run game
some niggaz like to trick but i aint wit that trickin shit
im like a jew savin dough so i can big whip
pushin a lex now im set ready to jet
no matter how much loot i get im stayin in the projects forever
jakes on the blocks we out-clever
if beef we never seperate and pull together
when worse comes to worse and my peoples come first
try to react and get them motherfuckin feelings hurt
my crews all about loot
fuck lookin cute im strictly timb boots and army certified suits
puffin ls laid back enjoyin the smell
in the bridge gettin down it aint hard to tell
you better realize

chorus mobb deep

we livin this til the day that we die
survival of the fit only the strong survive
we still livin it
we livin this til the day that we die
survival of the fit only the strong survive
thug life we still livin it
we livin this til the day that we die
survival of the fit only the strong survive
we still livin it
we livin this til the day that we die
survival of the fit only the strong survive
thug life we still livin it
the strong survive
