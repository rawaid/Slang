verse 1 prodigy

here come the vultures the mobb-laced potent rap shit
perhaps kid make it happen start the flippin
you fuckin comic who you kidding
my niggas laughing blood bathin the worlds greatest
in-famous crime-zanous
to interfere would be dangerous
plane descent stand clear save your strength
you couldnt do the limp if you was coked up
by my zd up whatever the fuck who gives a fuck you get fucked
my coalition specialises in collision
the clash of the cliques the duel o the iron mac spit
and leave ya half-split
youll be missin much more than a fraction
when its time for action
hit em while a man down make that nigga backspin
trapped up aÂ  madman
we blastin youre collapsin heavily light my gold mac 10
get imprisoned with dem raps they have you relapsin
you get castin the mobb deaf and assin
we face splashin dope fakes ice-pick stabbin
he slow leakin he ternally bleedin for speakin
outta place niggas get placed back indecent
live at the main event may i present
screamin out loud for any squad thats deaf
my infamous mobb ya heart throb hold ya breath
its ko from dead arm rights and hard lefts
another satisfied consumer who got blessed
single out ya army til theres no man left

chorus

man down man down down down down
*repeat x3*

verse 2 havoc

infamous cartel visible evidence

never hesitant opposition get settled here with
sharp shit thatll rip thru
one hundred layers of kevlar sharp like the jim star
exiled son he get sent far
hes the foulest qbc gat bust the loudest
below profile peep style thirsty prowlest
catchin court cases pay for your legal aid
son thats money wasted i aint got time for that
invest third place on my best sold rap
on the scrap from the ignorant cats

couldnt bust his gat right yo yknow what
but now you bucked your own man amatuer ass
homeboy take that ass to class

chorus

verse 3 big noyd

or you can snatch the mac for the faggot ai
