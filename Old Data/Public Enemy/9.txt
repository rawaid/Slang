i got a letter from the government
the other day
i opened and read it
it said they were suckers
they wanted me for their army or whatever
picture me given a damn - i said never
here is a land that never gave a damn
about a brother like me and myself
because they never did
i wasnt wit it but just that very minute
it occured to me
the suckers had authority
cold sweatin as i dwell in my cell
how long has it been
they got me sittin in the state pen
i gotta get out - but that thought was thought before
i contemplated a plan on the cell floor
im not a fugitive on the run
but a brother like me begun - to be another one
public enemy servin time - they drew the line yall
to criticize me some crime - never the less
they could not understand that im a black man
and i could never be a veteran
on the strength the situations unreal
i got a raw deal so im goin for the steel

they got me rottin in the time that im servin
tellin you what happened the same time theyre throwin
4 of us packed in a cell like slaves - oh well
the same motherfucker got us livin is his hell
you have to realize - what its a form of slavery
organized under a swarm of devils
straight up - wordem up on the level
the reasons are several most of them federal
here is my plan anyway and i say
i got gusto but only some i can trust - yo
some do a bid from 1 to 10
and i never did and plus i never been
im on a tier where no tears should ever fall
cell block and locked - i never clock it yall
cause time and time again time
they got me servin to those and to them
im not a citizen
but ever when i catch a c-o
sleepin on the job - my plan is on go-ahead
on the strength ima tell you the deal
i got nothin to lose
cause im goin for the steel

you know i caught a c-o
fallin asleep on death row
i grabbed his gun - then he did what i said so
and everymans got served
along with the time they served
decency was deserved
to understand my demands
i gave a warnin - i wanted the governor yall
and plus the warden to know
that i was innocent -
because im militant
posing a threat you bet its fuckin up the government
my plan said i had to get out and break north
just like with olivers neck
i had to get off - my boys had the feds in check
they couldnt do nuthin
we had a force to instigate a prison riot
this is what it takes for peace
so i just took the piece
black for black inside time to cut the leash
freedom to get out - to the ghetto - no sell out
6 c-os we got we ought to put their head out
but ill give em a chance cause im civilized
as for the rest of the world they cant realize
a cell is hell - im a rebel so i rebel
between bars got me thinkin like an animal
got a woman c-o to call me a copter
she tried to get away and i popped her
twice right
now who wanna get nice
i had 6 c-os now its 5 to go
and im serious - call me delirious
but im still a captive
i gotta rap this
time to break as time grows intense
i got the steel in my right hand
now im lookin for the fence

i ventured into the courtyard
followed by 52 brothers
bruised battered and scarred but hard
goin out with a bang
ready to bang out
but power from the sky
and from the tower shots rang out
a high number of dose - yes
and some came close
figure i trigger my steel
stand and hold my post
this is what i mean - an anti-nigger machine
if i come out alive and then they wont - come clean
and then i threw up my steel bullets - flew up
blew up who shot
what who the bazooka was who
and to my rescue it was the s1ws
secured my getaway so i just gotaway
the joint broke from the black smoke
then they saw it was rougher thatn the average bluffer
cause the steel was black the attitude exact
now the chase is on tellin you to cmon
53 brothers on the run and we are gone
