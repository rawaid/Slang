go go go go go go
take a look at his style
take a check of the sound
off the record people keep him down
trick a chick in miami
terminator x packs the jams
whow gives a fuck about a goddamn grammy
anyway and i say the ds defending the mike
yeah who gives a fuck about what they like
right the power is bold the rhymes politically cold
no judge can ever budge or ever handle his load
yes the coming is near and hes about to become
the one and only missionary lord son of a gun
going on and on back trackin the whack
explain the knack yall for the actual fact cmon

terminator x go off 4x
go go go go go go

he goes on and on till he reaches the coast
tired wired of his own race playing him close
understand his type of music kills the
plan of the klan
you know the pack attack the man
with the palm of his hands
police wild beasts dogs on a leash
no peace to reach - thats why hes packin his black piece
terminator x yellin with his hands
damn almighty rulin ready to jam
but his cuts drive against the belt
sheethes bad by his damn self
yeah his one job cold threatens the crowd
the loud sound pound to make brothers proud

terminator x go off 4x
go go go go go go

gettin small makin room for it all
flavors on the phone so he can
make the call
i know youre clockin the enemy
you should be clockin the time
checkin records im wreckin you
for defecting my rhyme
no provokin no jokin you know the stage is set
if youre thinkin im breakin
he aint rocked it yet
my education is takin you for a long ride
ill have you brain slip and do the slide
glide into infinity its infinite
with your hands in your pockets
i know your money is spent
like this like that butter for the fat
if you kill my dog ima slay your cat
its like that yall can you handle it son
im public enemy number one

terminator x go off 4x
go go go go go go
