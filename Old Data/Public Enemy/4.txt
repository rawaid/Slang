back
caught you lookin for the same thing
its a new thing - check out this i bring
uh oh the roll below the level
cause im livin low next to the bass cmon
turn up the radio
they claim that im a criminal
by now i wonder how
some people never know
the enemy could be their friend guardian
im not a hooligan
i rock the party and
clear all the madness im not a racist
preach to teach to all
cause some they never had this
number one not born to run
about the gun
i wasnt licensed to have one
the minute they see me fear me
im the epitome - a public enemy
used abused without clues
i refused to blow a fuse
they even had it on the news
dont believe the hype

yes
was the start of my last jam
so here it is again another def jam
but since i gave you all a little something
that we knew you lacked
they still consider me a new jack
all the critics you can hangem
ill hold the rope
but they hope to the pope
and pray it aint dope
the follower of farrakhan
dont tell me that you understand
until you hear the man
the book of the new school rap game
writers treat me like coltrane insane
yes to them but to me im a different kind
were brothers of the same mind unblind
caught in the middle and
not surrenderin
i dont rhyme for the sake of of riddlin
some claim that im a smuggler
some say i never heard of ya
a rap burgler false media
we dont need it do we
its fake thats what it be to ya dig me
dont believe the hype

dont believe the hype - its a sequel
as an equal can i get this through to you
my 98s boomin with a trunk of funk
all the jealous punks cant stop the dunk
comin from the school of hard knocks
some perpetrate they drink clorox
attack the black cause i know they lack exact
the cold facts and still they try to xerox
leader of the new school uncool
never played the fool just made the rules
remember theres a need to get alarmed
again i said i was a timebomb
in the daytime the radios scared of me
cause im mad plus im the enemy
they cant cmon and play with me in primetime
cause i know the time plus im gettin mine
i get on the mix late in the night
they know im livin right so here go the mike sike
before i let it go dont rush my show
you try to reach and grab and get elbowed
word to herb yo if you cant swing this
just a little bit of the taste of the bass for you
as you get up and dance at the lq
when some deny it defy if i swing bolos
then they clear the lane i go solo
the meaning of all of that
some media is the whack
you believe its true it blows me through the roof
suckers liars get me a shovel
some writers i know are damn devils
for them i say dont believe the hype
yo chuck they must be on a pipe right
their pens and pads ill snatch
cause ive had it
im not an addict fiendin for static
ill see their tape recoreder and grab it
no you cant have it back silly rabbit
im going to my media assassin
harry allen i gotta ask him
yo harry youre a writer are we that type
dont believe the hype
i got flavor and all those things you know
yeah boy part two bum rush and show
yo griff get the green black red and
gold down countdown to armageddon
-88 you wait the s1ws will
rock the hard jams - treat it like a seminar
teach the bourgeoise and rock the boulevard
some sau im negative
but theyre not positive
but what i got to give
the media says this
