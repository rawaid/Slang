in this corner with the 98
subject of suckers object of hate
whos the one some think is great
im that one son of a gun
driving by waving my fist
making em mad when im going like this
top gun never on the run
they know not to come cause they all get some
going quicker in the speeding lane
jealous cant do it and its causing them pain
caught in my smoke all they did was choke
look at my spokes you know im no joke
out that window middle finger for all
jealous at my ride stereo and blackwalls
suckers they got the nerve and gall
to talk about the car when theyre walking tall

suckers to the side i know you hate my 98
youre gonna get yours 
suckers to the side i know you hate my 98
youre gonna get yours

pulling away every day
leaving you in the dust so you know i get paid
on the mile ego trip and 5-0 tailing on my tip
watch me burn rubber fall in my flame
this episode is always the same
seeing no comp coming like im blind
all left back trailing my behind
i go faster cops try to shoot me
theyll get theirs when they try to get me
ill let it go my turbo
run em in the river cause theyre moving too slow
laughing hard at their attempt
so what if the judge charges me contempt
ill rub my boomerang cause im feeling proud
and i wouldnt even hear em cause my radios loud

suckers to the side i know you hate my 98
youre gonna get yours 
suckers to the side i know you hate my 98
youre gonna get yours

cruising down the boulevard
im treated like some superstar
you know the time so dont look hard
get with it the ultimate homeboy car
all you suckers in the other rides
wherever im coming get to my side
my 98 is tough to chase
if youre on my tail better watch your face
smoke is coming when i burn
rubber when my wheels turn
tinted windows so super bad
looking like the car the green hornet had
its the reason im ahead of the pack
its the reason i left them back
its the reason all the people say
my 98 olds blows em all away

my 98 oldsmobile is su-su-su
my 98 oldsmobiles so su-su-su
my 98 oldsmobile is su-su-su
my 98 oldsmobiles like super sporm

suckers to the side i know you hate my 98
youre gonna get yours 
suckers to the side i know you hate my 98
youre gonna get yours

understand i dont drive drunk
my 98s fly i dont drive no junk
no cop got a right to call me a punk
take this ticket go to hell and stick it
put me on a kick but line up times up
this government needs a tune up
i dont even know whats happening whats up
gun in my chest im under arrest
sidewalk suckers wanted to spill me
so i got my crew and posse
took the girls and got them to thrill me
stepped outside got in my ride
drove them around and i looked around town
caught em out there cold ran em over and down
they didnt get me and thats the truth
cause my 98-o is bullet proof

my 98 oldsmobiles so su-su-su
my 98 oldsmobile is su-su-su
my 98 oldsmobiles so su-su-su
my 98 oldsmobiles like super sporm
