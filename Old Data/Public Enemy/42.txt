runnin for your life by the knife
runnin from your wife  yipes
you shouldve stuck with home
your mind to blow your dome
it was you that chose your due
you built a maze you cant get through
i tried to help you all i can
now i cant do nuttin for you man

i cant do nuttin for ya man
you got all these people on your back now
i cant do nuttin for ya man
flavor flav got problems of his own
i cant do nuttin for you man

go lean on shells answer man
i cant do nuttin for ya man
you jumped out of the jelly into a jam

make ya love the wrong instead of right
not a thief cat burglar through the night
cop told your girl her name was shirl
about a rooftop crime to steal her pearls
oozy down the bullets in the gun

just microwave themselves a ton
the you tried to help them all they can
but they couldnt do nuttin for ya man

i cant do nuttin for ya man
they couldnt do nuttin for ya man

flavor flav is the sun
public enemy number one
gotcha runnin from the gun pow
of a brain that weighs a ton

cause you want a hand out for your wealth
eatin welfare turkey out of the can
i cant do nuttin for ya man

i cant do nuttin for ya man
you want six dollars for what
i cant do nuttin for ya man
