man you aint gotta
worry bout a thing
bout your daughter
nah she aint my type
but supposin she said she loved me
are you afraid of the mix of black and white
were livin in a land where
the law say the mixing of race
makes the blood impure
shes a woman im a man
but by the look on your face
see ya cant stand it

man calm your ass down dont get mad
i dont your sistah
but supposin she said she loved me
would you still love her
or would you dismiss her
what is pure  who is pure
is it european state of being im not sure
if the whole world was to come
thru peace and love
then what would we made of

excuse us for the news
you might not be amused
but did you know white comes from black
no need to be confused

excuse us for the news
i question those accused
why is this fear of black from white
influence who you choose

man cmon now i dont want your wife
stop screamin its not the end of your life
but supposin she said she loved me
whats wrong with some color in your family tree
i dont know

im just a rhyme sayer
skins protected gainst the ozone layers
breakdown 2001
might be best to be black
or just brown countdown

ive been wonderin why
people livin in fear
of my shade
or my hi top fade
im not the one thats runnin
but they got me one the run
treat me like i have a gun
all i got is genes and chromosomes
consider me black to the bone
all i want is peace and love
on this planet
aint that how god planned it

excuse us for the news
you might not be amused
but did you know white comes from black
no need to be confused

excuse us for the news
i question those accused
why is this fear of black from white
influence who you choose
