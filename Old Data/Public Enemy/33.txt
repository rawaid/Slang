bass in your face
not an eight track
gettin it good to the wood
so the people
give you some a dat
reactin to the fax
that i kick and it stick
and it stay around
pointin to the joint put the buddha down
goin goin gettin to the roots
aint givin it up
so turn me loose
but then again i got a story
thats harder than the hardcore
cost of the holocaust
im talin bout the one still goin on
i know
where im from not dum diddie dum
from the base motherland
the place of the drum
invaded by the wack diddie wack
fooled the black left us faded
king and chief probably had a big beef
because of dat now i grit my teeth
so heres a song to the strong
bout a shake of a snake
and the smile went along wit dat
cant truss it
kickin wicked rhymes
like a fortune teller
cause the wickedness done by jack
where everybody at
divided and sold
for liquor and the gold
smacked in the back
for the other man to mack
now the story that im kickin is gory
little rock where they be
dockin this boat
no hope im shackled
plus gang tackled
by the other hand swingin the rope
wearin red white and blue jack and his crew
the guys authorized beat down for the brown
man to the man each one so it teach one
born to terrorize sisters and every brother
one love who said it
i know whodini sang it
but the hater taught hate
thats why we gang bang it
beware of the hand
when its comin from the left
i aint trippin just watch ya step
cant truss it
an i judge everyone one by the one
look here come the judge
watch it here he come now
i can only guess whats happnin
years ago he woulda been
the ships captain
gettin me bruised on a cruise
what i got to lose lost all contact
got me layin on my back
rollin in my own leftover
when i roll over i roll over in somebody elses
90 f--kin days on a slave ship
count em fallin off 2 3 4 huned at a time
blood in the wood and its mine
im chokin on spit feelin pain
like my brain bein chained
still gotta give it what i got
but its hot in the day cold in the night
but i thrive to survive i pray to god to stay alive
attitude boils up inside
and that aint it think ill every quit
still i pray to get my hands round
the neck of the man wit the whip
3 months pass they brand a label on my ass
to signify
owned
im on the microphone
sayin 1555
how im livin
we been livin here
livin aint the word
i been givin
havent got
classify us in the have-nots
fightin haves
cause its all about money
when it comes to armageddon
mean im getting mine
here i am turn it over sam
427 to the year
do you understand
thats why its hard
for the black to love the land
once again
bass in your face
not an eight track
gettin it good to the wood
so the people
give you some a dat
reactin to the fax
that i kick and it stick
and it stay around
pointin to the joint put the buddha down
goin goin gettin to the roots
aint givin it up
so turn me loose
but then again i got a story
thats harder than the hardcore
cost of the holocaust
