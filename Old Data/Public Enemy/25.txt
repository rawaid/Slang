when im talkin rhyme time
to blow your mind time some say
its nothing worse than a verse
to hear some nigger curse
they call me rude some dudes fiery attitude
claimin i boast and smoke
and sometimes sing the blues
i twang metal and settle
try to never back pedal
from the power some got
to get a nigger shot
the null and void i avoid
i test the paranoid
never had to be bad
my mama raised me mad
so what i got is hot
i love my life a lot
im never sad just glad
thats why i thank my dad
once they never gave a fuck about
what i said
now they listen and they want my head

instead of peace the police
just wanna wreck and flex
on the kid
what i did was try to be the best
so they fingered the trigger
figured i was a bigger nigger
and started to search
an so i headed west
went to cally a rally
was for a brothers death
it was the fuzz who shot him
an not da blood or cuzz
i wondered why it was like
so i just held my mike
but in my mind i was blind
so i just tried to find
a reason we was quick
just the way that we was
so i just stayed in the crib
until i got a buzz
