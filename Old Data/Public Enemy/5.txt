brothers and sisters brothers and sisters 
i dont know what this world is coming to

yes - the rhythm the rebel
without a pause - im lowering my level
the hard rhymer - where you never been im in
you want stylin - you know its time again
d the enemy - tellin you to hear it
they praised the music - this time they play the lyrics
some say no to the album the show
bum rush the sound i made a year ago
i guess you know - you guess im just a radical
not a sabbatical - yes to make it critical
the only part your body should be parting to
panther power on the hour from the rebel to you

radio - suckers never play me
on the mix - just ok me
now known and grown when theyre clocking my zone its known
snakin and takin everything that a brother owns
hard - my calling card
recorded and orderd - supporter of chesimard
loud and proud kickin live next poet supreme
loop a troop bazooka the scheme
flavor - a rebel in his own mind
supporter of my rhyme
designed to scatter a line of suckers who claim i do crime

terminator x

from a rebel its final on black vinyl
soul rock and roll comin like a rhino
tables turn - suckers burn to learn
they cant dis-able the power of my label
def jam - tells you who i am
the enemys public - they really give a damn
strong island - where i got em wild and
thats the reason theyre claimin that im violent
never silent - no dope gettin dumb nope
claimin where we get our rhythm from
number one - we hit ya and we give ya some
no gun - and still never on the run
you wanna be an s1 - griff will tell you when
and then youll come - youll know what time it is
impeach the president - pullin out the ray-gun
zap the next one - i could be youre sho-gun
suckers - dont last a minute
soft and smooth - i aint with it
hardcore - rawbone like a razor
im like a lazer - i just wont graze ya
old enough to raise ya - so this will faze ya
get it right boy and maybe i will praise ya
playin the role i got soul too
voice my opinion with volume
smooth - no what i am
rough - cause im the man

no matter what the name - were all the same
pieces in one big chess game
yeah - the voice of power
is in the house - go take a shower boy
pe a group a crew - not singular
we were black wranglers
were rap stranglers
you cant angle us - i know youre listenin
i caught you pissin in youre pants
youre scared of us dissin us
the crowd is missin us
were on a mission boy

terminator x

attitude - when im on fire
juice on the loose - electric wire
simple and plain - give me the lane
ill throw it down your throat like barkley
see the car keys - youll never get these
they belong to the 98 posse
you want some more son - you wanna get some
rush the door on a store - pick up the album
you know the rhythm the rhyme plus the beat is designed
so i can enter your mind - boys
bring the noise - my time
step aside for the flex - terminator x
