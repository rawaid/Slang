with vice i hold the mike device
with force i keep it away of course
and im keepin you from sleepin
and on stage i rage
and im rollin
to the poor i pour in on in metaphors
not bluffin its nothin
that we aint did before
we played you stayed
the points made
you consider it done
by the prophets of rage
power of the people say

i roll with the punches so i survive
try to rock cause it keeps the crowd alive
im not ballin im just callin
but im past the days of yes yallin
wa wiggle round and round
i pump you jump up
hear my words my verbs
and get juiced up
i been around a while
you can descibe my sound
clear the way
for the prophets of rage
power of the people say

i rang ya bell
can you tell i got feelin
just peace at least
cause i want it
want it so bad
that im starvin
im like garvey
so you can see b
its like that im like nat
leave me the hell alone
if you dont think im a brother
then check the chromosomes
then check the stage
i declare it a new age
get down for the prophets of rage
keep you from gettin like this

you back the track
you find were the quotable
you emulate
brothers sisters thats beautiful
follow a path
of positivity you go
some sing it or rap it
or harmonize it through go-go
little you know but very
seldom i do party jams
about a plan

im considered the man
im the recordable
but god made it affordable
i say it you play it
back in your car or even portable
stereo
describes my scenario
left or right black or white
they tell lies in the books
that youre readin
its knowledge of yourself
that youre needin
like vescey or prosser
we have a reason why
to debate the hate
thats why were born to die
mandela cell dweller thatcher
you can tell her clear the way for the prophets of rage
power of the people you say

its raw and keepin you on the floor
its soul and keepin you in control
its pt 2 cause im
pumpin what youre used to
until the whole juice crew
gets me in my goose down
i do the rebel yell
and im the duracell
call it plain insane
brothers causein me pain
when a brothers a victim
and the sellers a dweller in a cage
yo run the accapella
power of the people say
