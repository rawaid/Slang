our father 
who art in heaven 
please watch over me 
24/7 
please give me 
something to believe in 
im either driven or crippled by these demons 
sometimes it feels like the power i wield is a blessing and a curse 
and i wanna shine up on my brothers like the sun 
but when my light is gone

change to be ugly 
i wanna be happy i dont wanna hurt the ones i love 
they the ones who only getting hurt the most 
please send your angels 
to save me from myself 

i wanna feel free 
i wanna feel please 
well i can feel pleased 
if im feeling guilty

please forgive me 
for all my sins please 
and forgive them who keep sinning against me 
may my enemies live long so they can see me progress 
i know that my biggest enemy is me and that pain is weakness leaving my body 
and if i dance with the devil in the pale moonlight its alright 
but deliver me from evil with my soul intact 
and no regrets 
amen
