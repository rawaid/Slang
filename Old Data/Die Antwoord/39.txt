ninja bout to kick a little story bout miranda
i was out dopping by the purple turtle hanging wif some homies
skopped one too many dops damn i need to go pee
im on my to take a piss and i see this $copie
she looked just like a coloured angelina jolie
the cherry looked very happy to see me mister

i couldnt help staring at those nice tits
chilling just below them big fat blow job lips
plus a g-string all up in that salty crack
i said shit i need to piss but ill be back
that night was a fuckin jol think it was a thursday
dj bumped some 50 go shorty its your birthday
miranda asked me in when i dropped her back at her place
on the veranda ninja fucked miranda on the first date
and everything was hunky fuckin dory
then comes the twist to this funky little story
at my next live show
guess whos in the front row staring at me like a psycho
mirandas big green hawk eyes
glued to the ninja like a red beam all night
after the show ninja gets rushed by a bunch of poppies
i tell miranda heres some money go buy yourself a doppie
so im there signing autographs smoking a doobie
can i get your autograph sure show me your boobies
all of a sudden miranda busts in making a spectacle
grabs me by the nuts and starts breaking my testicles
jassis i nearly klapped her cos
those heavy fuckin claws digging
into my balls was very fuckin sore
eweskielik n hele klomp fokken koppe draai
miranda says tsy vat jy my vir n fokken naai

there by dj hi-teks crib
when she says to me cant we be alone
so i took her to hi-teks room
about to close the door and drop the bomb
i said i got the bong she said i got the herb
i told dj hi-tek do not disturb
then bada-bada-bing bada-bada-bomb
i put the flame on the motherfuckin bong
like bubble bubble now the heat is on
lazaan told me she wanted me to be the one
i started slow and sexy yo ima getting some
punani-nani punani-num-num
like bada-bada-bam bada-bada-boom
when hi-tek walked in the motherfuckin room
there i was giving it to her from behind
i said whats the matter bro
dj hi-tek you wanna have a go
lazaan starts having this moerse fuckin freak out
there i am standing like a doos with my dick out
shes kicking me slapping teeth flaring swearing
