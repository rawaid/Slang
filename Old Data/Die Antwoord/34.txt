all my fokken life i lived a normal fokken life
till i went and got myself caught up with the mic
and the beast coming dope with the rhymes and the flows
a real life trying to cope with the highs and the lows
i got sick and tired of getting treated like a stupid fuck-up
so i fucked my enemies up one time and blew the fok up
before it was like yo whos that stupid weirdo
now its like its a new breed a rap superhero
to defeat these devils ninja becomes a devil
these god-forsaken wretches will never be on my level
wies jy fok you and your whole crew
i got you stressin double guessin
cause i wont do what im supposed to
i dont know you poppie say hello to
my little two friends im telling you and i told you
wat you try to speak but your tongues frozen
in south africa i sleep with both my eyes open

fok julle naaiers fok julle naaiers
fok julle fok julle fok julle naaiers

motherfuckers tell me to slow my role
but sorry no can do my style is so brand new
i try to make you understand it
im here to steal the fokken show
cause baby im a bandit
now youre standing looking at me 
like the aliens have landed
all hail the great white ninja
every poes with a phone wants to take my picture
ninja jas i dig that oke
is it real no its just a big black joke
when dealing with an idiot theres really nothing you can say
next time you ask me is it real
im gonna punch you in the face
to help you feel me bitch i get paid to be funky
be nice or im gonna change to be ugly
im zef like a young hugh hef oh yes
may my enemies live long so they can see me progress
put the pedal to the metal
and im scorching my tires
middle finger in the air
yeah fok julle naaiers

fok julle naaiers fok julle naaiers
fok julle fok julle fok julle naaiers
