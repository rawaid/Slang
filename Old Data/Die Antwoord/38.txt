synth voice 
i dont need you i dont need you youre like see thru i dont see you x 2

chorus 
i dont need you
i dont need you
youre like see through
i dont see you

i dont need you
i dont need you
youre like see through
i dont see you

im a playa
folding paper
from the golden acre
to the over seas
move over please
the over taker
hot boude shaker
the fucking answer
youre fucking last year
dit was lekker maar dis nou klaar [it was nice but its now finished]
you got your pat on the back but you cant fuck with the roger ballen of rap

dont speak to me
did somebody say something
with the bass pumping
the place jumping

i dont need you
i dont need you
youre like see through
i dont see you

i dont need you
i dont need you
youre like see through
i dont see you

you got no fucking voice
got no fucking face
i dont love you
im above you 

i dont need you
i dont need you
youre like see through
i dont see you 

i dont need you
i dont need you
youre like see through
i dont see you

i dont need you
i dont need you
youre like see through
i dont see you
