i bear my soul niggas wouldnt dare my role 
gives a nigga a heart of gold but with a hole 
lost all control my shoulders hold a lot of weight 
just like first time soldier eighth done told us not to hate 
but then its out of state and its too late 
for change is to be made 
thats what i get for fucking with strangers in the shade 
this is it that niggas got to give me a place 
for the same reason that fate chose to give me away 
take away hate now im supposed to love the one that cursed me 
the one that wouldnt give me a cup of water when i was thirsty 
it was always his versus me but now i gotta teach him 
personal feelings put aside cuz now i gotta reach him 
what id like to do is turn my head like i dont know him 
but it seems like ive been called on to show him 
so ima show him 
and if you never met me then youve no right to judge me 
ive got a good heart but this heart can get ugly 

look in my eyes see what i see 
do what i do be what i be 
walk with my shoes that hurt your feet 
and know why i lurk the streets

look in my eyes see what i see 
do what i do be what i be

and know why i lurk the streets

feel the pain feel the joy of a man who was never a boy for real
