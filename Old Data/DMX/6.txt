to find my way and now i know that happy days are not far away
if im strong enough ill live long enough to see my kids
doing something more constructive with they time
than bids i know because i been there
now im in there sit back and look
at what it took for me to get there
first came the howll the drama with my mama
she got on some fly shit what til i split
and said that ima be that seed
that doesnt need much to succeed
strapped with mad greed and a heart that doesnt bleed
im ready for the world or at least i thought i was
baggin uhh when i caught a buzz
for thinking about how short i was
going too fast it wouldnt last but yo i couldnt tell
group homes and institutions prepare my ass for jail
they put me in a situation forcin me to be a man
when i was just learnin to stand without a helpin hand
damn was it my fault somethin i did
to make a father leave his first kid at 7 doin my first bid
back on the scene at 14 with a scheme
to get more cream than id ever seen in a dream
and by all means i will be living high off the hog
and i never gave a what about much but my dog
thats my only howll i had offered my last
just another little come on headed nowhere fast

ay yo im slippin im fallin i cant get up
ay yo im slippin im fallin i cant get up
ay yo im slippin im fallin i gots to get up
get me back on my feet so i can tear shit up

actions become bolder heart got colder
chip on my shoulder that i dared a uhh to touch
didnt need a click cause i scared a uh huh that much
one deep went to &lt;edited&gt; for kicks
catchin vicks throwin bricks gettin by bein slick
used to get high to get by used to have to howl
in the morning before i get fly
i ate something a couple of forties made me hate somethin
i did some arf now im ready to take something
3 years later showing signs of stress
didnt keep my hair cut or give a come on how i dressed
im possessed by the darker side livin the cruddy life
what like this kept a nigga with a bloody knife
wanna make records but im wheeewd up
im slippin im fallin i cant get up

ay yo im slippin im fallin i cant get up
ay yo im slippin im fallin i cant get up
ay yo im slippin im fallin i gots to get up

wasnt long before i hit rock bottom
howll was like damn look how that how that got him

sayin to myself that couldve been yo &lt;edited&gt; on the tv
believe me it could be done somethins got to give
its got to change cause ive got a son
ive got to do the right thing for shorty
and that means no more getting high drinking forties
so i get back lookin type slick again

and much respect to all my come on that kept it real
