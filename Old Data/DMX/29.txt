look in your eyes and thank the lord for my child 
meanwhile somethin i gotta show you an i hope you can take it 
gonna leave you in the desert an i hope that you make it 
gotta put you on your ass to see what it does to you 
when you stand up an see that im just showin love to you 
other niggas would put a slug through you over your ends 
caps i fucked with are real but hey

takes another dog to be able to hear my silent screams 
the devil got a hold on me an he wont let go 
i can feel the lord pullin but he movin dead slow 
let em know that amidst all this confusion 
some of us may do the winnin 
but we all do the losin its just who does the choosin 
easy goin up or down what have you been provin 
jus that you were fuckin ground 
bitch seen the bullshit but never spoke on it 
an i know that deep down you really dont want it 
i woulda traded the chance of bein the child with a father 
movin talent and bein able to survive when its harder 
my balance on the high beams of life keep my dreams in strife 
thats why i hit these motherfuckin streets at night
