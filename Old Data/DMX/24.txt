same old shit dog just a different day
you know how niggas do when we play how we play
it is not a fucking game
a mans gotta do what a mans gotta do
if its fuck me nigga then you know its fuck you

i kick it to shorty to try to help him understand uuh
hit him with work cause yo thats my little man uh-uhh
he asked a few questions bout the game and i told him 
and when he made a bad move it was my place to scold him aight
never told nutting wrong i kept it fair
he didnt listen  so i might as well have been talking to the air damn
everybody makes mistakes and mistakes is aight
but if it aintima tell you straight time to say goodnight
nobody likes to be played regardless of the relationship
but shortys fucking up big time i hate this shit
im caught in the middle of having love for a lil nigga
knowing whats expected of me as a real nigga damn
my next move is crucial wat do i do
how do i keep real to my shorty and my crew
didnt want to kill him so instead of putting the mac on him
i did the only thing i could do turn my back on him
