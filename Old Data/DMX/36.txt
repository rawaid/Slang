you tell me that theres love here 
but to me its blatant 
nothin but all the blood here 
im dealin with satan 
plus with all the hatin 
its hard to keep peace uh huh 
thou shall not steal 
but i will to eat 
i tried doin good but 
goods not too good for me 
misunderstood 
why you chose the hood for me 
me im aiight 
i just had to work hard at it 
went to grama for answers 
she told me that god had it 
so now here i am 
confused and full of questions 
am i born to lose 
or is this just a lesson 
and who its goin choose 
when it gets turned around 
and will it be 
layin in my own blood 
and on the ground 

my child 
ive watched you grow up 
and ive been there uh huh 
even at those times 
you least suspected it 
i was there 
and look at what ive given you 
a talent to rhyme 
i may not come when you call 
but im always on time 

somebodys knockin 
should i let em in 
lord were just startin 
but where will it end 
somebodys knockin 
should i let em in 
lord were just startin 
but where will it end 
but when the funds are low 
the gunsll blow 
lookin for that one that owe 
make em run that dough 

no 
put down the guns 
and write a new rhyme 
youll get it all in due time 
youll do fine 
just have faith 
cuz you mine uh huh 
and when you shine 
its goin be a sight to behold 
so dont fight to be old 
or lose sight when its cold 
see that light down the road 
its goin guide you there 
two sets of footprints 
i was right beside you there 

but what about them times i 
only saw one 
those were the times that i was 
under the gun 

it was then i carried you my son 
led you to safety 
it just wasnt your time to face me uh huh 

ayo a few of them times i thought you would erase me 
but all you did was embrace me 
prepared me for the worst 
offered me eternal light 
and scared me with the hearse 
and the curse 
turned to grace 
when the hurt 
turned to faith 
no more runnin uh huh 
and slidin in the dirt 
cuz im safe 

somebodys knockin 
should i let em in 
lord were just startin 
but where will it end 
somebodys knockin 
should i let em in 

so if im yo man 
im in yo hand 
wus yo plan 
never had a friend 
cuz you couldnt trust your man 
learned to stand before i crawled 
things were twisted 
and if you showed me anything at all 
then i missed it 
looked the wrong way uh huh 
ive done some wrong things true 
kept a bad attitude 
but thats what wrong brings 
and now you mean to tell me that 
after all this time 
it was you that kept the dog from goin out of his mind 
it was you that breathed life 
into my lungs when i was born 
and it was you that let me know 
what was right 
from what was wrong 
and it was you that let me do 
what i knew what could be done 
and it was you that gave me a good wife 
and a beautiful son 
and its been you speakin to me 
inside my mind 
and its been you who has forgiven 
time after time 
it was you who opened my eyes 
so i could see 
and it was you who shined yo 
light on me
