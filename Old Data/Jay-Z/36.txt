have you ever have you ever
have you ever have you ever

have you ever been to heaven
have you ever seen the gates
have you bowed unto your highness
and do you know how heaven taste
lie me down

arm leg leg arm head -- this is god body
knowledge wisdom freedom understanding -- we just want our equality
food clothing shelter -- help a nigga find some peace
happiness for a gangsta aint no love in the streets

conspiracy theorist screaming illuminati
they cant believe this much skill is in the human body
hes 62 how the fuck he fit in a new bugatti
aw fuck it you got me

question religion question it all
question existence until them questions are solved
meanwhile this heretic i be out in marrakesh
morocco smoking hashish with my fellowship

yall dwell on devil shit im in a diablo yellow shit
color of jello-o shit
hello bitch its me again
fresh in my easter clothes feeling like jesus and

have you ever been to heaven
have you ever seen the gates
have you bowed unto your highness
and do you know how heaven taste
lie me down

thats me in the corner
thats me in the spotlight
losing my religion

getting ghost in the ghost
can you see me can you see me
have mercy on a judas angels wings on a ghini
im secular tell the hecklers settle down
yall religion creates division
like my maybach partition and
god is my chauffeur
boy they loves hova
from the south side of chi
to brooklyn where i growed up

i confess god in the flesh
live among the serpents turn arenas into churches
im like michael recycled
these are not 16s these are verses from bible

tell the preacher hes a preacher
im a motherfucking prophet
smoke a tree of knowledge
drink from a gold chalice

you gotta love it
i arrive at pearly gates i had luggage
meaning i had baggage
niggas asking me questions i dont answer to these busters
only god could judge us motherfuckers

have you ever been to heaven
have you ever seen the gates
have you bowed unto your highness
and do you know how heaven taste

heaven or hell
the cards weve been dealt
are the cards that we play play play
double what you believe
only one god receives
when the shots spray spray spray
lie me down

have you ever been to heaven
have you ever seen the gates
have you bowed unto your highness
and do you know how heaven taste
knock me down
