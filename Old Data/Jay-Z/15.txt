it makes it easier easier to bear
you wont regret it no no
no girl they wont forget it
love is their home
happiness yeah
sq-sq-sq-squeeze her dont tease her
never leave herâ€¦

sounds so soulful dont you agree

i invented swag
poppin bottles puttin supermodels in the cab proof
i guess i got my swagger back truth
new watch alert hublots
or the big face rollie i got two of those
arm out the window through the city i maneuver slow
cock back snap back
see my cut through the holes

and pray that all of their pain be champagne
