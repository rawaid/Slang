this time its for the money my nigga
brooklyn stand up

[verse one]
theres never been a nigga this good for this long
this hood
or this pop this hot
or this strong
with so many different flows
this ones for this song
the next one ill switch up
this one will get bit up
these fucks
too lazy to make up shit
they crazy
they dontpaint pictures
they just trace me
you know what
soon they forget where they plucked
they whole style from
and try to reverse the outcome
im liketough
im not a biter
im a writer
for myself and others
i say a big verse im only biggin up my brother
biggin up my borough
im big enough to do it
im that thorough
plus i know my own flow is foolish
so them rings and things you sing about
bring em out
its hard to yell when the bar-rels in your mouth
im innew sneakers
deuce seaters
few divas
what more can i tell you
let me spell it for you
w-i-double l-i-e
nobody truer than h-o-v
and im back for more
new yorks ambassador
prime minister back to finish my business up

[chorus singing]
what more can i say
what more can i do
i give this all to you
i know this much is true
my life
look at my life
see what i see

[verse two]
you already know what im about
flyin birds down south
movin wet off the step
purple rain in the drought
stuntin on hoes
brushin off my shirt
but aint nothin on my clothes
cept my chain
my name
young h-o
pitch the yay faithful
even if they patrol i make payroll
benz paid for
friends they roll
private jets down the turks and caicos
cris case loads
i dont give a shit
nigga one life to live i cant let a day go
by
without me being fly
fresh to death
head to toe until the day i rest
and i dont wear jerseys im thirty plus
give me a crisp pair of jeans nigga button ups
s dots on my feet
make my sight complete
what more can i say guru play the beat im livin

we gonna let this ride into the hook
imma snap my fingers on this one
what more can i say to you
get my grown man on
lets go
what more can i say

[verse three]
now you know ass is willie
when they got you in a mag
for like half a billi
and your ass aint lilly
white
that mean that shit you write must be illy
either that or your flow is silly
its both
i dont mean to boast
but damn if i dont brag
them crackers gonna act like i aint on they ass
the martha stewart
thats far from jewish
far from a harvard student
just had the balls to do it
and no im not through with it
in fact im just previewin it
this aint the show im just eqin it
one two and i wont stop abusin it
to groupie girls stop false accusin it
back to the music
the maybach roof is translucent
niggas got a problem houston
what up b
they cant shut up me
shut down i
not even pe
imma ride
god forgive me for my brash delivery
but i remember vividly
what these streets did to me
so picture me
lettin these clowns nit pick at me
and paint me like a pickiny
i will literally
kiss tee-tee in the forehead
tell her please forgive me
then squeeze into your forehead
im not the one to score points off
in fact
i got a joint to knock your points off
young
hova the god nigga blasphamy
im at the trump international
ask for me
i aint never scared
im everywhere
you aint never there
nigga why would i ever care
pound for pound im the best to ever come around here
excluding nobody
look what i embody
the soul of a hustler i really ran the street
a ceos mind
that marketing plan was me
and no i aint get shot up a whole bunch of times
or make up shit in a whole bunch of lines
and i aint animated like say a busta rhymes
but the real shit you get when you bust down my lines
add that to the fact i went plat a bunch of times
times that by my influence on pop culutre
i supposed to be number one on everybody list
well see what happens when i no longer exist
fuck this man

what more can i say
