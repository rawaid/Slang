human beings in a mob
whats a mob to a king
whats a king to a god
whats a god to a non-believer who dont believe in anything
will he make it out alive
alright alright no church in the wild

jay-z
tears on the mausoleum floor
blood stains the colosseum doors
lies on the lips of a priest
thanksgiving disguised as a feast
rolling in the rolls royce corniche
only the doctors got this i’m hiding from police
cocaine seats all white like i got the whole thing bleached
drug dealer chic i’m wondering if a thug’s prayers reach
is pious pious cause god loves pious
socrates asked whose bias do yall seek
all for plato screech
i’m out here balling i know yall hear my sneaks
jesus was a carpenter yeezy he laid beats
hova flow the holy ghost get the hell up out your seats preach

kanye west
coke on her black skin made a stripe like a zebra
i call that jungle fever
you will not control the threesome
just roll the weed up until i get me some
we formed a new religion
no sins as long as there’s permission
and deception is the only felony
to never fuck nobody without telling me
sunglasses and advil
last night was mad real
sun coming up 5 am
i wonder if they got cabs still
thinking bout the girl in all leopard
who was rubbing the wood like kiki shepard
two tattoos one read no apologies
the other said love is cursed by monogamy
it’s something that the pastor don’t preach
it’s something that a teacher can’t teach
when we die the money we can’t keep
but we probably spend it all cause the pain ain’t cheap preach
