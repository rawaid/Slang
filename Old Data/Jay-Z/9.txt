cant none of yall mirror me back
yeah hearin me rap is like hearin g rap in his prime
im young ho raps grateful dead
back to take over the globe now break bread
im in boeing jets global express
out the country but the blueberry still connect
on the low but the yacht got a triple deck
but when you young what the fuck you expect yep yep
grand openin grand closin
god your man hov cracked the can open again

just draw off inspiration

cheap imitations for dese generations

cookin raw with the brooklyn boy
so for one last time i need yall to roar
now what the hell are you waitin for chester
after me there shall be no more
so for one last time nigga make some noise

now what the hell are you waitin for chester

sighs look what you made me do look what i made for you
knew if i paid my dues how will they pay you
when you first come in the game they try to play you
then you drop a couple of hits look how they wave to you
from marcy to madison square
to the only thing that matters in just a matter of years yea yea
as fate would have it jays status appears
to be at an all-time high perfect time to say goodbye
when i come back like jordan wearin the 4-5
it aint to play games witchu
its to aim at you probably maim you
if i owe you im blowin you to smithereeens
cocksucker take one for your team
and i need you to remember one thing one thing mike
i came i saw i conquered
from record sales to sold out concerts
so muhfucker if you want this encore
i need you to scream til your lungs get sore

chester
im tired of being what you want me to be
feeling so faithless lost under the surface
dont know what youre expecting of me
put under the pressure of walking in your shoes
caught in the under toe just caught in the undertow mike
every step that i take is another mistake to you
caught in the under toe just caught in the undertow mike
and every second i waste is more than i can take
ive become so numb
i cant feel you there
become so tired
so much more aware
im becoming this
all i want to do
is be more like me
and be less like you

become so numb

mike jay-z
can i get an encore
do you want more more more more

ive become so numb

mike jay-z
one last time i need yall to roar
one last time i need yall to roar
