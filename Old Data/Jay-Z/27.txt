they cant keep a gooda man down
always keep a smile when they want me to frowns
keep the vibes and they stood my grounds
they will never ever take my crown
who jah bless i say no man curse
things gettin better when they thought it would be worse
here comes the officers askin for a search
they found no weapon just only a draw of herbs
