i just want a picasso in my casa
no my castle
im a hassa no im an asshole
im never satisfied cant knock my hustle

i wanna rothko no i wanna brothel no
i want a wife that fuck me like a prostitute
lets make love on a million in a dirty hotel
with the fan on the ceiling

all for the love of drug dealing
marble floors gold ceilings
oh what a feeling
fuck it i want a billion

jeff koons balloons i just wanna blow up
condos in my condos i wanna row of
christies with my missy live at the moma
bacons and turkey bacons smell the aroma

oh what a feeling
picasso baby ca picasso baby
ca ca ca picasso baby ca ca ca picasso baby
oh what a feeling
picasso baby ca picasso baby
ca ca ca picasso baby ca ca ca picasso baby

it aint hard to tell im the new jean michel
surrounded by warhols my whole team ball
twin bugattis outside the art basel
i just wanna live life colossal

leonardo da vinci flows
riccardo tisci givenchy clothes
see me thrown at the met
vogueing on these niggas champagne on my breath yes

house like the louvre or the tate modern
because i be going ape at the auction
oh what a feeling
aw fuck it i want a trillion

sleeping every night next to mona lisa
the modern day version with better features
yellow basquiat in my kitchen corner
go ahead lean on that shit blue you own it

oh what a feeling
picasso baby ca picasso baby
ca ca ca picasso baby ca ca ca picasso baby
oh what a feeling
picasso baby ca picasso baby
ca ca ca picasso baby ca ca ca picasso baby

okay i never stuck my cock in the foxs box but
damned if i didnt open pandoras box
they try to slander your man on cnn and fox
my miranda dont stand a chance with cops

even my old fans like old man just stop
i could if i would but i cant im hot
and you blow im still the man to watch
hublot on my left hand or not

soon i step out the booth
the cameras pops niggas is cool with it
till the canons pop
now my hand on the bible

on the stand got your man in a jam again
got my hands in cuffs
im like god damn enough
i put down the cans and they ran amok

my hairpin piece skin rupture spleens
cracks rips go through cribs and other things
no sympathy for the king huh
niggas even talk about your baby crazy
eventually the pendulum swings
dont forget america this how you made me
come through with ye mask on
spray everything like samo
though i wont scratch the lambo

whats it gonna to take for me to go
for yall to see
im the modern day pablo
picasso baby
