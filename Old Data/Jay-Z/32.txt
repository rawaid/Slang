this shit is wicked on these mean streets
none of my friends speak
were all trying to win but then again
maybe its for the best though cause when theyre seeing too much
you know theyre trying to get you touched
whoever said illegal was the easy way out couldnt understand the mechanics
and the workings of the underworld granted
nine to five is how you survive i aint trying to survive
im trying to live it to the limit and love it a lot
life ills poison my body
i used to say fuck mic skills and never prayed to god i prayed to gotti
thats right its wicked thats life i live it
aint asking for forgiveness for my sins endz
i break bread with the late heads picking their brains for angles on
all the evils that the gamell do
it gets dangerous money and power is changing us
and now were lethal infected with devils

we used to fight for building blocks
now we fight for blocks with buildings that make a killing
the closest of friends when we first started
but grew apart as the money grew and soon grew black-hearted
thinking back when we first learned to use rubbers
he never learned so in turn im kidnapping his babys mother
my hand around her collar feeding her cheese
she said the taste of dollars was shitty so i fed her fifties
about his whereabouts i wasnt convinced
so i kept feeding her money til her shit started to make sense
who could ever foresee we used to stay up all night at slumber parties
now im trying to rock this bitch to sleep
all the years we were real close
now i see his fears through her tears know shes wishing we were still close
dont cry it is to be
in time ill take away your miseries and make em mine devils

my flesh no nigga could test
my soul is possessed by devils in the form of diamonds and lexuses
the exorcist got me doing skits like homie
you dont know me but the whole world owe me

was thought to be a pleasant guy all my fucking life
so now im down for whatever aint nothing nice
throughout my junior high years it was all friendly
but now this higher learning got the remy in me
liquors invaded my kidneys
got me ready to lick off mama forgive me
i cant be held accountable devils beating me down boo
got me running with guys making gs telling lies that sound true
come test me i never cower
for the love of money son im giving lead showers
stop screaming you know the demon said its best to die
and even if jehovah witness bet hell never testify devils
