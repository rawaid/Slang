yeah hah yeah roc-a-fella
we invite you to somethin epic yall knowsomething something
well we hustle out of a sense of hopelessness
sort of a desperationlive nigga
through that desperation we come addicted
sorta like the fiends we accustomed to servin
but we feel we have nothin to loseeverything to gain
so we offer you well we offer our lives right
what do you bring to the table

while im watchin every nigga watchin me closely
my shit is butter for the bread they wanna toast me
i keep my head both of them where they supposed to be
hoesll get you sidetracked then clap from closed feet
i dont sleep im tired i feel wired like codeine these days
a brother gotta admire from four fiends away
my pain wish it was quick to see from sellin caine
til brains was fried to a fricaisse cant lie
at the time it never bothered me at the bar
gettin my thug on properly my squad and me
lack of respect for authority laughin hard
happy to be escapin poverty however brief
i know this game got valleys and peaks expectation
for dipsfor percipitation we stack chips hardly
the youth i used to be soon to see a millin
no more big willie my game has grown prefer you call me william
illin for revenues rayful edmund-like
channel 7 news round seven jews hand dead on the mic
forgettin all i ever knew convenient amnesia
i suggest you call my lawyer i know the procedure
lock my body cant trap my mind easily
explain why we adapt to crime
id rather die enormous than live dormant thats how we on it
live at the main event i bet a trip to maui on it
presidential suites my residential for the weekend
confidentially speakin in codes since i sense you peekin
the in excess rental dont be fooled my game is mental
we both out of town dog what you tryin to get into
viva las vegas see ya later at the crap tables
meet me by the one that starts a g up
this way no fraud willies present gambling they re-up
and we can have a pleasant time sippin margaritas
ge-ge-geyeahhh can i live
can i live

my mind is infested with sick thoughts that circle
like a lexus if driven wrong its sure to hurt you
dual level like duplexes in unity my crew and me
commit atrocities like we got immunity
you guessed it manifested intangible goods
platinum rolexed it we dont lease
we buy the whole car as you should
my confederation dead a nation explode
on detonation overload the mind of a said patient
when it boils to steam it comes to it
we all fiends gotta do it even righteous minds go through this
true this history school us to spend our money foolish
bond with jewelers and watch for intruders
i stepped it up another level meditated like a buddhist
recruited lieutenants with ludicrous dreams of
gettin cream lets do this against t-d-s
so i keep one eye open like c-b-s ya see me
stressed right can i live
can i live
can i live
can i live
ha-hah roc-a-fella yall
