thank you thank you thank you youre far too kind

[chorus jay-z w/ kanye voiceover]
now can i get an encore do you want more
cookin raw with the brooklyn boy
so for one last time i need yall to roar

now what the hell are you waitin for
after me there shall be no more
so for one last time nigga make some noise

[verse one]
who you know fresher than hov  riddle me that
the rest of yall know where im lyrically at
cant none of yall mirror me back
yeah hearin me rap is like hearin g rap in his prime
im young ho raps grateful dead
back to take over the globe now break bread
im in boeing jets global express
out the country but the blueberry still connect
on the low but the yacht got a triple deck
but when you young what the fuck you expect  yep yep
grand openin grand closin
god your man hov cracked the can open again
who you gon find doper than him 
with no pen just draw off inspiration
soon you gon see you cant replace him
with cheap imitations for these generations

[chorus] - 1/2

{what the hell are you waiting forrrr}

[verse two]
{*sighs*} look what you made me do look what i made for you
knew if i paid my dues how will they pay you
when you first come in the game they try to play you
then you drop a couple of hits look how they wave to you
from marcy to madison square
to the only thing that matters in just a matter of years yea
as fate would have it jays status appears
to be at an all-time high 
perfect time to say goodbye
when i come back like jordan wearin the 4-5
it aint to play games witchu
its to aim at you probably maim you
if i owe you im blowin you to smithereeens
cocksucker take one for your team
and i need you to remember one thing one thing
i came i saw i conquered
from record sales to sold out concerts
so muhfucker if you want this encore
i need you to scream til your lungs get sore

[interlude dj]
owwww  its star time
this man is made  hes killin all yall jive turkeys

[verse three]

and thats two point four and im only doin two

you wanna be in the public send your budget
well fuck it i aint budgin

record companies told me i couldnt cut it
now look at me all star-studded
golf 4 above par like i putted
all cause the shit i uttered was utterly ridiculous

send hip a grip then you got spit
a little somethin like this woo

{what the hell are you waiting forrrr}
{*piano plays out as crowd cheers loudly*}
