air all my laundry in the streets dirty or clean
give it up for fame
but i still dont know why why i love it so much
yeah

and baby its amazing im in this maze with you
i just cant crack your code
one day you screaming you love me loud
the next day youre so cold

one day you here one day you there
one day you care youre so unfair
sipping from your cup till it runneth over
holy grail

blue told me to remind you niggas

caught up in all these lights and cameras
but look what that shit did to hammer

god damnit it i like it
the bright lights enticing
but look what it did to tyson

thirty mil for one fight
but soon as all the money blows
all the pigeons take flight

and baby its amazing im in this maze with you
i just cant crack your code
one day you screaming you love me loud
the next day youre so cold

one day you here one day you there
one day you care youre so unfair
sipping from your cup till it runneth over
holy grail

psycho bitches in my lobby
i got haters in the paper
photo shoots with paparazzi

sliding by in that big body
curtains all in my window

this fame hurt but this chain works
i think back you asked the same person
if this is all you had to deal with
nigga deal with it this shit aint work

this light work
camera snapping my eyes hurt
niggas dying back where i was birthed
fuck your iris and irs

you got the shit that niggas die for dry yours
why you mad take the good with the bad
dont throw that baby out with the bath water

living the life
vanilla wafers in a villa
illest nigga alive
michael jackson thriller

and baby its amazing im in this maze with you

one day you screaming you love me loud
the next day youre so cold

one day you here one day you there
one day you care youre so unfair
sipping from your cup till it runneth over
holy grail

you take the blade right out of my heart just so you can watch me bleeding
i still don’t know why why i love you so much

one day you screaming you love me loud

sipping from your cup till it runneth over
