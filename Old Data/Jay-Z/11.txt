take the bassline out uh huh
jigga uh huh uh huh uh huh

its the hard knock life for us
its the hard knock life for us
stead of treated we get tricked
stead of kisses we get kicked
its the hard knock life

from standin on the corners boppin 
to drivin some of the hottest cars new york has ever seen 
to droppin some of the hottest verses rap has ever heard 
from the dope spot with the smoke glock fleein the murder scene you know me well 
from nightmares of a lonely cell my only hell
but since when yall niggas know me to fail fuck naw
where all my niggas with the rubber grips bust shots
and if you with me mama rub on ya tits and what not
im from the school of the hard knocks we must not
let outsiders violate our blocks and my plot
lets stick up the world and split it 50-50 uh huh
lets take the dough and stay real jiggy uh huh
lets sip the cris and get pissy pissy
flow infinitely like the memory of my nigga biggie baby
you know its hell when i come through
the life and times of shawn carter nigga volume 2 - yall niggas get ready

its the hard knock life for us
its the hard knock life for us
stead of treated we get tricked
stead of kisses we get kicked
its the hard knock life

i flow for those droed out
all my niggas locked down in the 10 by 4 controllin the house
we live in hard knocks we dont take over we bomb blocks
burn em down and you can have em back daddy id rather that
i flow for chicks wishin they aint have to strip to pay tuition
i see you vision mama
i put my money on the long shots all my ballers thats born to clock
now ima be on top whether i perform or not
i went from lukewarm to hot sleepin on futons and cots
to king size green machines to green 5s 
ive seen pies let the thing between my eyes analyze lifes ills
then i put it down tight real
im tight grill with the phony rappers you might feel we homeys 
im like still you dont know me shit
im tight real when my situation aint improvin
im tryin to murder everythin movin feel me

its the hard knock life for us
its the hard knock life for us
stead of treated we get tricked
stead of kisses we get kicked
its the hard knock life for us
its the hard knock life for us
stead of treated we get tricked
stead of kisses we get kicked
its the hard knock life

i dont know how to sleep i gotta eat stay on my toes
got a lot of beef so logically i prey on my foes
hustlin still inside of me and as far as progress
you be hard-pressed to find another rapper hot as me
i gave you prophecy on my first joint and ya all lamed out
didnt really appreciate it til the second one came out
so i stretched the game out xed your name out
put jigga on top and drop albums non-stop for ya nigga

its the hard knock life for us
its the hard knock life for us
stead of treated we get tricked
stead of kisses we get kicked
its the hard knock life for us
its the hard knock life for us
stead of treated we get tricked
stead of kisses we get kicked
its the hard knock life
its the hard knock life
