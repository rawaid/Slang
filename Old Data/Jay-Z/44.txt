[intro notorious big interview]
well im basically tryin to stay above water yknow
just stay busy stay workin
puff told me like the key to this joint
the key to staying on top of things
is treat everything like its your first project knahmsayin
like its your first day like back when you was an intern
like thats how you try to treat things like just stay hungry

[verse one jay-z]
uhh uhh yes yes
yall wanna know why he dont stop
yall wanna know why he dont flop
let me tell you pe-peeople why
came from the bottom of the block i
when i was born it was sworn i was never gon be shit
had to pull the opposite out this bitch
had to get my ri-ide on
eyes on the prize shawn knew i had to
had to had to get these chips
had to make moves like olajuwon
started out sellin dimes and nicks
graduated to a brick
no exaggeration my infatuation with the strip
legendary like a schoolboy
crushin merely nearly every every chick
heavy shit - thats how schoolboy got whipped
and got left on some just +me myself and i+
on some trugoy shit
had your boys threw place up to a place of no return
had to play with fire and get burned
only way the boy ever gon learn
had to lay way in the cut til i finally got my turn
now im on top in the spot that i earned

[chorus]
its my life - its my pain and my struggle
the song that i sing to you its my ev-ery-thing
treat my first like my last and my last like my first
and my thirst is the same as - when i came
its my joy and my tears and the laughter it brings to me
its my ev-ery-thing

[verse two jay-z]
like i never rode in a limo
like i just dropped flows to a demo
like its ninety-two again and
and i got os in the rental
back in the stu again no prob livin was a whole lot simpler
when you think back you thought that
you would never make it this far then you
take advantage of the luck you handed
or the talent you been given
aint no half steppin aint no no slippin
aint no different from a block thats hidden
gotta get it while the gettings good
gotta strike while the irons hot fore you stop
then you gotta bid it good riddance
goodbye this is my second major breakup
my first was with a pager
with a hooptie a cookpot and the game
this ones with the stool with the stage with the fortune
maybe not the fortune but certainly the fame

[chorus]
its my life - my pain and my struggle
the song that i sing to you its my ev-ery-thing
treat my first like my last and my last like my first
and my thirst is the same as - when i came
its my joy and my tears and my laughter it brings to me
its my ev-ery-thing
treat my first like my last and my last like my first
and my thirst like the first song i sang
