i am a roc representer
hov summer to winter hov dead or alive
twenty-four/seven three-sixty-five
one cd or three-hundred and sixty pies
whassup to e and kirk  welcome home to taj
let no amount of money ruin this thing of ours
we run streets like drunks run street lights
we collidin with life as we speak
we knee deep in coke we ki deep in ice
we flood streets with dope we keep weed to smoke
we all fish better teach your folk
give him money to eat then next week hes broke
cause when you sleep hes reachin for your throat
word on the skreet you reap what you sew
not out of fear but love love for the game
roc family first we never change mayn

whats up to my miami and st thomas connects whattup
ill never mention your name i promise respect
death before dishonor correct - yup
thats what you promised me since the lee
along with if we stay strong
we can get paper longer than pippens arms
plead the fifth when it comes to the fam
im like a dog - i never speak but i understand
where my dogs at  where my soldiers at war
where your balls at  whoa gotta pause that - whoa
lost 92 bricks had to fall back
knocked a nigga off his feet but i crawled back
had a-1 credit got more crack
from the first to the fifth gave it all back
if im not a hustler what you call that
this is before rap this is all fact
i never change
