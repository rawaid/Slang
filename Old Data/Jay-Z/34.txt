hood could swallow a man bulletsll follow are followin me
theres so much coke that you could run the slalom
and cops comb the shit top to bottom
they say that we are prone to violence but its home sweet
where personalities clash and chorme meets chorme
the coke prices up and down like its wall street homes
but this is worse than the dow jones your brains are now blown
all over that brown brome one slip you are now gone
welcome to hell where you are welcome to sell
but when them shells come you better return em
all scars we earn em all cars we learn em like the back of our hand
we watch for cops hoppin out the back of van
