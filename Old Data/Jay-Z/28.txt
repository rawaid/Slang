just let me be great
let me be great
i feel like mothafuckin cassius clay right now genius

dont be good my nigga be great
after that government cheese we eating steak
after the projects now we on estates
im from the bottom i know you cant relate

fuck up the world
lets fuck up this world
fuck up the world
me and destiny got a date

martin had a dream hov gotta team
my chain already heavy dont let me get a ring
parades down flatbush confetti on my fur
turn right on red hook niggas heavy on the curve

see most of my niggas died early twenties or late teens
im just trying to come from under the thumb of this regime
1% of a billion is more then niggas even seen
still they wanna act like its an everyday thing clean

fuck up the world
lets fuck up this world
fuck up the world
fuck up the uh

high yellow sky dweller and the rose gold
legend of the summer in the rose bowl
came thru pasadena in the low low
just to show respect to the cholos

feelin like a stranger in my own land
got me feeling like brody in homeland
i just want my shot to show my genius
standing on the top hold my penis

america tried to emasculate the greats
murder malcolm gave cassius the shakes
wait tell them rumble young man rumble
try to dim your lights tell you be humble

you know im gon shine like a trillion watts
you know a nigga trill as michael jackson socks
send a light to compton and the hundred blocks
lil bastard boy basking on top

fuck up the world
lets fuck up this world
lets fuck up the world
lets fuck up this world
fuck up the uh

sipping duss√© boy this aint your daddy yak
he in a cadillac; me im in the maybach
this aint grey sweat suits and white tube socks
this is black leather pants and a pair of stance

socks is my synopsis is clear
got stripclubs feeling like oxford i swear
teacher teacher i trying to unteach ya
all the shit they taught ya they got you all in the bleachers

when you front row at the knicks game those the spike lees
you front row every where you in the hovs
jordan 1s and dungarees
and thats just the half of my warpath

make a million another million let my niggas make a million
till we all check a billion shit its just the way im feeling
we have yet to see a ceiling we just top what we top
cause the bars dont struggle and the struggle dont stop

lets fuck up this world
lets fuck up this world
lets fuck up the world
lets fuck up the world

its our time now
lets fuck up the world
fuck up this world
