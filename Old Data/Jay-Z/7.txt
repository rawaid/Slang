[jay-z]
holla at me
i do this for my culture
to let em know what a nigga look like when a nigga in a roaster
show em how to move in a room full of vultures
industry shady it need to be taken over
label owners hate me im raisin the status quo up
im overchargin niggaz for what they did to the cold crush
pay us like you owe us for all the years that you hoed us
we can talk but money talks so talk mo bucks

[chorus]

[jay-z]
yeah
hov is back life stories told through rap
niggaz actin like i sold you crack
like i told you sell drugs; no hov did that
so hopefully you wont have to go through that
i was raised in the pro-jects roaches and rats
smokers out back sellin they mamas sofa
lookouts on the corner focused on the ave
ladies in the window focused on the kinfolk
me under a lamp post why i got my hand closed
cracks in my palm watchin the long arm of the law
so you know i seen it all before
i seen hoop dreams deflate like a true fiends weight
to try and to fail the two things i hate
succeed in this rap game the two things thats great
h to the izz-o v to the izz-a
what else can i say about dude i gets bu-sy

[chorus]

*girls singing*
h to the izz-o v to the izz-a *repeat 4x to fade*
