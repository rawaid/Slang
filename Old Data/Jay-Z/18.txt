makes a mill up off a sorry hoe
then sit back and peep my sce-nawr-e-oh

now these motherfuckers know we carry mo heat than a little bit
we dont pull it out over little shit
and if you catch a lick when i spit then it wont be a little hit
go read a book you illiterate son of a bitch and step up yo vocab

and you see us comin down on yo slab
livin ghetto-fabulous so mad you just cant take it
