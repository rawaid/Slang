rock on roc-a-fella yall
the saga continues

ahh who wanna bet us that we dont touch leathers
stack cheddars forever live treacherous all the et ceteras
to the death of us me and my confidants we shine
you feel the ambiance yall niggaz just rhyme
by the ounce dough accumulates like snow
we dont just shine we illuminate the whole show; you feel me
factions from the other side would love to kill me
spill three quarts of my blood into the street let alone the heat
fuck em they hate a nigga lovin his life
in all possible ways know the feds is buggin my life
hospital days reflectin when my man laid up
on the uptown high block he got his side sprayed up
i saw his life slippin this is a minor set back
yo still in all we livin just dream about the get back
that made him smile though his eyes said pray for me
ill do you one better and slay these niggaz faithfully
murder is a tough thing to digest its a slow process
and i aint got nothin but time
i had near brushes not to mention three shots
close range never touched me divine intervention
cant stop i from drinkin mai-tais with ta ta
down in nevada ha ha poppa word life
i dabbled in crazy weight without rap i was crazy straight
potnah im still spendin money from eighty-eight what

chorus

geyeah know what ill make

roll like monopoly advance you copy me
like white crystal i gross the most
at the end of the fiscal year than these niggaz can wish to
the dead presidential canidate
with the sprinkles and the presidental ice thatll offend you
in due time when crime flees my mind
all sneak thieves and playa haters can shine
but until then i keep the trillion cut diamonds shinin brilliant
ill tell you half the story the rest you fill it in
long as the villian win
i spend japan yen attend major events
catch me in the joints convinced my iguanas is bitin
