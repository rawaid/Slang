hey sucka nigga
where ever you are
i thought about ya fool
while i was driving my car

i wonder if you fools realize how far
you are
youre nowhere in my rear mirror

your last shit aint better than my first shit
your best shit aint better than my worst shit
the truth in my verses
versus
your metaphors about what your net worth is
