but he also got a righteous cause for sinnin

but vengance is mine said the lord

breathin off res-por-rators

on permanent hiatus as i skate
in the mabach benz
flier than sanaa lathan
pumpin brown sugar by dangelo
in los angeles

i can introduce you to your maker
bring you closer to nature
ashes after they cremate you bastards
hope you been readin your psalms and chapters
payin your tithes being good catholics

[verse two]
yes
this is holy war
i wet cha all with the holy water
spray from the heckler koch auto
matic all the static shall cease to exist
like a sabbatical i throw a couple at you
take six
spread love to all of my dead thugs
ill pour out a little louis til i head above
yes sir
and when i perish
the meek shall inherit the earth
until that time its on a poppin - church
like don bishop
the fifth upon cock either
lift up your soul or give the holy ghost please
i leave ya in somebodys cathedral
and stuntin like evil kenevil
ill let you see where that bright light lead you
the more you talk the more you irkin us
the more you gonna need memorial services
the black albums second verse is like
devils pie save some dessert for us

[breakdown]
man i gotta get my soul right
i gotta get these devils out my life
these cowards gonna make a nigga ride
they wont be happy til somebody dies

man i gotta get my soul right
for im locked up for my whole life
every time it seems its all right
somebody want they soul to rise
ill chase you off of this earth

[verse three]
i got dreams of holdin a nine milla
to bobs killa
askin him why as my eyes fill up
these days i cant wake up with a dry pillow
gone but not forgotten holmes i still feel ya
socurse the day that birthed the bastard
who caused your church mass
reverse the crash
reverse the blast
and reverse the car
reverse the day and there you are
bob allah
lord forgive him we all have sinned
but bobs a good dude please let him in
and if you feel in my heart that i long for revenge
please blame it on the sun of the morning
thanks again
