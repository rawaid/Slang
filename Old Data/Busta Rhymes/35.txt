yo i walk through brick walls
fuck around hijack your whole shopping malls

when i tumble and drive then you reply my my my my my my
yo i execute all plans
run up in two bitches for me and my mans
ha breakin flows ha for my fans
in return they just give me the ha sound stand
strike matches golden egg hatches
request line is open send all your faxes
freaks the flows with no rehearsin
rollerskate backwards which when the beat start reversin
you so wack you make people start cursin
flows contradict worser than the king james version
turn on the mic but your shit will stop workin
beats brutalized your whole rhyme your head hurtin
broom sticks and britches from rags to riches
forget mad love

amateur why wont you look right at the calender
a matter of time before i start to damage ya
so starting to just bust my rhyme calibre
consecutive wounds like a nigga stabbin ya

with rhymes galore busta rhymes be embassador

bounce on the beat and watch how a nigga work it
buck wild makin ya speaker short circuit
this heavyweight tip the scale on the triple beam

fuck what you heard we aint heard this before
