where my thuggers and my cripples and my bloodles and my brothers
when you niggas gon unite and kill the police mothafuckas
or take over a jail give those cos hell
the burnin of the sulfur god damn i love the smell
like its a pillow torchin where the fuck the warden
and when you find him we dont kill him we just waterboard him
we killin em for freedom cause they tortured us for boredom
and even if some good ones die fuck it the lordll sort em

el-p killer mike

a wise man once said we all dead fuck it
just spit it disgusting youngin and hold your nuts while youre gunnin
i listened tatted a sentence on my dick last summer
now ill never get that phrase off my brain its no wonder
im here to buy hearts i got hundreds honey
the cheaper the parts the better buy for the money
im trained in vagina whisperin glistenin
waitin for their christenin i know the neighbors cant help but listen in
a dirty boy who come down on a side of dissonance
i cant even relax without sirens off in the distances
not shittin you little buddy this fuckin islands a prison
the only silence i have is an act of conjugal visitin

killer mike el-p
my solitary conditions preventin conjugal visits
go mane and missin my misses they keepin me from my children
conditions create a villain the villain is givin vision
the vision becomes a vow to seek vengeance on all the vicious
liars and politicians profiteers of the prisons
the forehead engravers enslavers of men and women
includin members of clergy that rule on you through religion
so strippin kids to the nude and then tell em godll forgive em

my battle status is burnin mansions from dallas to malibu
check my résumé your residence is residue
call her a skin job and my honey dipll backflip for you
you playin god your eye sockets she gon rip in two
we sick of bleedin out a trace spray a victim you
done dyin phillip ak dickin you
with clips in the bottom we dippin from gotham
yes eclipsed by the shadows a dark dance to the coffin
im a fellow with melanin suspect of a felony
ripped like rakim allah feds is checkin my melody
yes aggressively tested well bump stretchers and penalties
dump cases with face and the cop pleas when we seizing a pump
with reason to dump on you global grand dragons
still pilin fast plus afghani toe taggin
now they trackin me and we bustin back see
the only thing that close quicker than our caskets be the factories
