big l
i drive up and down harlem blocks iced out watch
knots in my socks cops think im selling rocks
pulling me over too see if im drunk
but im sober they wouldnt f**k with me if i drove a nova
listen columbo youre mad because your money come slow
and what you make in a year i make in one show
now you wanna frisk me and search my ride
call me all kinda names try to hurt my pride
youre just mad cause im a young cat pockets dumb fat
talkin bout where the gun at i been there and done that
im through with that illegal life im stayin legit
i love to see cars come cruisin bye and playin my shit
i walk around with six thou without a pist-al my whole clicks wild
im rich pal no more sticks im makin hits now
i drink cristal im through breakin laws
i dont sell coke anymore i do tours
so get that flashlight out of my face
to bring me down them jakesll do whatever it takes
word up them federals got my phone and my house tapped
praying that i fall for the mouse trap i doubt that

chorus big l

why do i end up in so much shit
i done came way too far to be callin it quits


jake wanna lock me up even though im legit
they cant stand to see a young brother pockets get thick

fat joe
aiyyo enoughs enough federals try to set me up
put me in cuffs and crush what i lust into dust
plus they want a nigga sewed but they know
big joey crack aint never rat a cat that he know
fo sho death before dishonor; i left the streets alone
since tone deceased it almost killed his mama
so ima keep doin what im doin
pursuin my dream til there enough cream to start my own union
and show these kids how legit it is
shit is real i used to steal but now i own several businesses
so wheres your witness that you claim to have sayin that im takin half
extortin new york and not payin tax
im layin back playin the role playin the low
but its the same ol joe so dont get kod
hey yo im gonna fry for what i never did
or catch a heavy bid why dont they just let a nigga live 

chorus 2x

what would you do
if the vicious enemy suddenly started comin at you
armed to the teeth and ready to kill you
