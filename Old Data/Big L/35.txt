crooked corrupted criminal crime boss with cream
cocaine hustler blowing out the brains of busters
being my mansion chilling inhalin the ganja smoke
counting mad cream weighin tons of coke
guarded by thugs and rottweilers

this money be temptin me to jump out the mpv empty 3
clips of hollow tips with no sympathy
since 14 i sold morphine for more green
kept open a nautica coat under the draw sting
and watched out for cops squad cars and beamerz
and laundry ninas
flea the country to argentina
laid back in the beach yeah
coastin with commuters
smokin the buddahs on the cruiseline boat to aruba
for awhile yo pump the vowel so i can pile dough
then become a harlem kingpin just like al po
get paid so i can lay low in san diego
with yay-o so i can ship it out whenever i say so

chorus
yo makin this money is the american dream

with all kinds of amazing flows
money surrounded i counted with bathing with asian hoes
back home niggas is after me

coke factory fiends baggin up crack for me
from cutting up rocks to investing in stocks
nautica yachts and knots busting outa my socks
now thats bloods play the chub
all the ladies love me they hate who made me hubby
behind my back they say my babys ugly
each night i sleep with freaks with lamborghini jeeps
neighbors be sneaking peeks how my semen leaks between the sheets
mess up my loot i cut your collars juan
cause these is modern times and the only thing i see is dollar signs

chorus
yo makin this money is the american dream
east coast to west coast you know what i mean
whether its uptown downtown you pick the scene
you gots to get your own scheme
we aint splitin this cream
