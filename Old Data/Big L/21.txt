still run with the same clan used to be a kane fan

whats this motherf**kin rap game without l 
yo thats like jewels without ice
thats like china without rice
or the holy bible without christ
or the bulls without mike
or crackheads without pipes
the village without dykes
or hockey games without fights
dont touch the mic if you unable to spit
flamboyant is the label im with motherf**ker
