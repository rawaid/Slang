yo yo yo
im from a place where them niggaz dont talk no shit
where them wigs get split where the guns forever click
where the track stars come to warm up for a race
blue and whites ride by and niggaz yell fuck them jakes
so much respect i can lay dough on the floor
walk away and come back without cats runnin off
im a model hoes wet dream in her sleep
performin x-rated fuck scenes me goin deep
oc the starchild let your cameras record
im like a man bein honored at the grammy awards
i pitch lines like fastballs
mush-out rap my ass off
knuckle gaze crumblin your glass jaw
supreme figure drink liquor what team thicker
the big picture be the motherfuckin theme nigga
flamboyant forever this is how it goes
pray we dont clap your way when the gats explode

chorus remi martin and oc repeat 2x

where im from dudes get sliced cause crews is trife
and you might lose your life for your jewels and ice
ima slide to the telly and abuse your wife
if i got one rubber ima use it twice
i give young fools advice about the rules of heist
when i rock gators hoes be like them shoes is nice
dimes im willin to hit i stay drillin a chick
they all know i aint shit but they still on my dick
and i never walk the streets without the vest and the chrome
cause all my jewels be rocky like sylvester stallone
i blast the tech at your dome to leave you restin alone
go home and puff a fat bag of sess til im gone
you got this nigga frontin like he the main event
