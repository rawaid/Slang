and listen real closely how i break this slang shit down

check it my weed smoke is my lye 
a ki of coke is a pie

cars is whips and sneakers is kicks
money is chips movies is flicks
also cribs is homes jacks is pay phones
cocaine is nose candy cigarettes is bones
a radio is a box a razor blade is a ox
fat diamonds is rocks and jakes is cop
and if you got rubbed you got stuck 
you got shot you got bucked
and if you got double-crossed you got fucked
your bankroll is your poke a choke hold is a yoke
a kite is a note a con is a okey doke
and if you got punched that mean you got snuffed
to clean is to buff a bull scare is a strong bluff
