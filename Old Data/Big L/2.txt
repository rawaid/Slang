aiyyo you betta flee hobbes or get your head flown three blocks
l keep rappers hearts pumpin like reeboks
and every year i gain clout and my name sprouts
some brothersd still virgins if the crack never came out
i got the wild style always been a foul chil
my guns go poom-poom and yo guns go pow-pow
im known to have a hottie open i keep the shottie smokin
front and get half the bones in your body broken
and when it comes to getting nookie im not a rookie
