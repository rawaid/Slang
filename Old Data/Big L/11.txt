everybody everywhere is scratching for what they can get
did you think anybody in this town is any different
they dont give a damn who gets killed
just as long as the dice keep rollin
the hoes keep hoein
and the money keeps flowin

my name is l and im from a part of town where clowns 
get beat down and all you hear is gunshot sounds
on 139 and lennox ave theres a big park
and if youre soft dont go through it when it gets dark
cause at nighttime niggas try to tax
theyre sneakier than alley cats
thats why i carry gats
yo im a muthafuckin fugitive
buckwild and foul is the lifestyle that i choose to live
because to me its all about a buck
i used to have a partner in crime by the name of chuck
we stormed the city shootin shit up like frank nitty
we robbed kids and split the dough 50/50
one day we stuck a dice game on the ave and split the cash
then i murdered his ass and took his half
because im all about ends and skins
when you got dough you dont need no muthafuckin friends
if i catch you on a late night black youre gettin stuck jack
my moms told me to get a job fuck that
aiyo picture me gettin a job
takin orders from bob sellin corn on the cob
yo how the hell ima make ends meet
makin about 120 dollars a week
man i rather do another hit
i want clean clothes mean hoes and all that other shit
yo i admit im a sucker
a low down dirty sneaky double-crossin canivin muthafucka
breakin in cribs with a chrome bar
i wasnt poor i was po i couldnt afford the o-r
i used to wait until it gets dark
and tell a nigga to strip i wanna see some birthmarks
like a ninja dressed in black with a ski mask
i take all the funds then i run down the street fast
i vicked this nigga named eugene
took his brand new ring
cause stickin ups a everyday routine
once i was crusin in a beat-up ride
saw this nigga named clyde
and snuck up on him from the blind side
i told him give up the dough before you get smoked
oh youre broke  *shots*  now youre dead broke
the big l was cold crazy
a top-notch crook snatchin pocket books from old ladies
i dont care ill do anything to get a buck
even rob a miller truck cause i dont give a fuck
some say im ruthless some say im grim
once a brother done broke into my house and i robbed him
plenty and many brains i bust
cause i was livin the lifestyle of the poor and dangerous

word
all of us from harlem
139
thats livin the lifestyle of the poor &amp; dangerous
