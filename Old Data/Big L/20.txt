i just finished doin a song
now im ready for sleep
but first i want spaghetti to eat
in this good italian restaurant right up the street
so i jumped in the jeep stash the heat under the seat
then i got a beep
my voice is harsh barely can speak
i called back on the cell
its coley mad as hell
he told me to listen well as he started to yell
i just seen mike and ben with your wife and a friend
and they just got a room in the holiday inn
its my wife you sure

i saw the whore as soon she walked through the door

we goin hurt those hoes
and hurt both of them kids
now im in the range
switchin lanes doin a buck n change
i cant wait to touch the lames and them fuckin dames
reach the destination grab the heat without no hesitation
these niggas fuckin up my reputation
i saw coleone holdin the chrome
ice-grill lookin like he had a license to kill
and he had somebody else with em playin the cup
lookin like he cant wait to start sprayin shit up

and pull our gats out and throw our mask on
we aint leavin till everyones dead and all the cash gone
we goin to get our laugh on when were through
but right now we got a job to do
so lets do it
hey yo i stepped to the deskclerk
put the gat to her dress-shirt
told her to listen up before she get hurt
they just walked in party of four two chicks two males
what room they got
she paused and said 212
took the steps now im out of breath
i gotta stop smokin
them cigarettes goin be the cause of my death
my heart beatin fast now cause its about to pop off
saw the door let the glock off tore the lock off
took a deep breath then ran inside at a quick pase
i felt disgraced i shouldve shot the bitch in the face
then my other two niggas ran in
each had a cannon
ready to take care how we done planned it
these two crab cats we know they hustle upstate
we know they got stacks
cause they dont move with nothin but weight
we got the cuffs and the ducktape and put it to use
then told em when this is over we be lettin em loose
hey man i kicked mike in his face
so i just had your back
you wanna live and tell my nigga where the stash at
he gave me the address then i ran outside
but first i took the keys to his van outside
and when i got there i found 50 keys in a stash
a 100 pound of grass and 2 million in cash
i was dumb glad
the sit didnt fit in one bag
so i got three filled em all up to the teeth
and put the bags in the van then i locked the truck
when i got back coley done popped them punks
hey yo fuck it l we might as well pop these studs

and after that we aint sleep for three days
we hit the pjs split the money threeways
