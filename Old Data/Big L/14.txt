when me and my crew hit the clubs we go straight to the bar
leave em empty i cruise through harlem in an m3

[big l]
yo its corleone and queens most we bust till your whole team ghost
everywhere we go we must bring toast forever
popping the chrome always dropping a poem
i can write it or recite it off the top of the dome
however you want it is how im gonna give it to you big l style
they brought it back to the streets cause that shit sell now
so pal back up a bit give me some elbow space
i represent harlem world not melrose place
so im a lace the jewels up with nice brigettes
flamboyant is the label that writes the checks
yall niggas better stop fronting cause i might get vexed
and im a run up on yall and slice ya necks
with the machete pockets heavy slang more cane than eddie
i represent uno trece nueve
time is money so i stay late im quick to sign a playmate
bust off like a tre-eight then vacate uh
