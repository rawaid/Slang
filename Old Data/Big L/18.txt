hey yo the streets love me man
and i love the streets
so i know ya aint think i was comin with some fruitcake shit
ya know me better than that

ayo i shoulda been out
im deadly when i pull the pin out
keep frontin ima try yo chin out
i knocked a lot of men out
i left em on the floor spittin phlegm out
its either that or ima squeeze the gat and pop ten out
you see corleone ice spinnin jigged out white linen
and if a bitch dont like me she must like women
every time i come around you see your wife grinnin
dont be mad cuz yo careers in the ninth innin
its over now nigga leave the game
im from the danger zone where emcees get slain
were thugs that never hesitate to squeeze the flame
were niggaz be takin drugs just to ease the pain
hustlers flip cokey 48 hours like nick nolte
when i was ot your bitch rode me
first day home i dived in it
left her thighs dented
now that bitch be pagin me every five minutes
emcees i squash and disgrace its all about the benjis
so why your bills got washingtons face
a lot of cats be frontin
made singles wit a fifty on top
l tryin to have the city on lock
peace to biggie and pac cuz they really were hot
rap game heavy hitters its a shame they no longer wit us
niggaz wanna be l ladies wanna see l
if i go to jail youll wear a shirt sayin free l
what

word up man them niggaz is hungry
they ready to bite a nigga arm off

chorus repeat 2x

all my wolves in the house are you live or what
see harlem bout to get it all eyes on us
only ghetto niggaz shine who gon rise wit us
and the first cat who act we gon size em up

ayo i hear a lot of bitch in your talk
see a lot of switch in your walk
only thugs get rich in new york
time is runnin out
niggaz likel when you comin out
because they sick of all this drag queen shit
your wifes missin im the nigga she was last seen wit
me and ron hit it up on some tag team shit
a buncha niggaz got smoked for the cash
used to ride greyhounds wit dime holes and stuff the coke in they ass
crazy beefs got provoked in the past lot of wigs got split
a lot of innocent kids got hit
harlem world be the place of my birth believe me son
we breed the smoothest niggaz on the face of the earth
mics i steadily smoke rhymes cleverly wrote
as long as i can rock a crowd ima never be broke
some hoes treated me like a bum nerve when i was unheard
now im icey i aint gotta say one word you dumb bird
i push whips while you walk all day
and i hate when strange niggaz wanna talk all day
clown ass shit hate to be around that shit
you dont know me just say whatsup gimme a pound thats it
when i was at the steak house pullin cake out
you was at some cheap chinese shit gettin take out
how you make out you took the fake route you oughta break out
you couldnt get a bitch before you put your tape out
what

fuckin punks
niggaz like you will get robbed everyday

chorus 2x
