yo fuck all the glamours and glitz i plan to get rich
im from new york and never was a fan of the knicks
and im all about expandin my chips
you mad cause i was in the van with your bitch
with both hands on her tits
corleone hold the throne that you know in your heart
i got style plus the way that i be flowin is sharp
a while back i used to hustle sellin blow in the park
countin g stacks and rockin ice that glow in the dark
forever - hottie huntin trigger temper im quick to body somethin
you lookin at me like im probably frontin
i fuck around and throw three in your chest and flee to my rest
im older and smarter this is me at my best
i stopped hangin around yall cause niggaz like you
be prayin on my downfall hopin i flop
hopin i stop you probably even hope i get locked
or be on the street corner with a pipe smokin the rock
i got more riches than you fuck more bitches than you
only thing i havent got is more stitches than you

and if you think i cant fuck with whoever put your money up
put your jewels up no fuck it put your honey up
put your raggedy house up nigga or shut your mouth up
before i buck lead and make a lot of blood shed
turn your tux red im far from broke got enough bread
and mad hoes ask beavis i get nuttin butt-head
{*laughter*} my game is vicious and cool
fuckin chicks is a rule
if my girl think im loyal then that bitch is a fool
how come you can listen to my first album
and tell where a lot of niggaz got they whole style from
