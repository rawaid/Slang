verse one

let me get to the point real quick when ya pockets are thick
mad chicks be on a brothers tip
when ya sporting jewels and driving in a groovy car
all the hos go sweat you like a movie star
to get in ya pockets thats what the girls wanna do
but if you not rich them chicks gonna front on you
no matter how strong your rap
you only nock boots when you got loot and your on the map
cause if you broke youll get a wack slut
if you got dough you get a ho with a fat butt
with fresh gear long hair and a cute face
and if ya live alone shes gonna pack her suit case
and move in then ya start losing all ya bucks
soon your brothers a joke a not a rut
then she takes off and brakes off ya hos gone so long dear
im outta here a good relationships been torn
cause when you on top everythings ok
but when you broke you get no play

chorus

if you dont got endz you wont be gettin no skinz
and if you dont got money you wont skoop a honey
if you dont got cash you wont be gettin no ass
and if your not clocking loot you wont be knockin no boots

verse two

girls of the 90s aint nothing but crooks
its all about whats in ya pockets not how ya look
thats why you cant talk to just any whore
leaving brothers for the next man cause hes got a penny more
they want a drug dealer not a scholar
some girls barely speak but always asking for a dollar
and if you pushing a fresh benz theyll be ya best friends
yeah as long as you collect ends
you think shes all yours but as soon as your dough go
your ho go now you solo
but when you was makin papers sucker jumped hos
you bought dumb clothes for all of them bum hos
and you was taking em to the movies every weekend
now that you dead broke the girls not speaking
cause nowadays girls want you to crook
the only thing they can get from big l is a big
cause when you on top everythings ok
but when you broke you gets no play

chorus 2x

verse three

i tell it how it is cause im a goldfigga
and i hate a money hungry girl aka golddigger
it aint even funny
some girls dont even know me asking me can they get some money
im looking nothing like ya poppa
i wouldnt give a chick 10 cent to put cheese on a whopper
they wanna know why im so fly
a girl ask me for a ring and i put one around her whole eye
chicks used to diss but now they wanna kiss
yo showbiz ima break it down like this

chorus 2x

outro

its like that yall and thats a fact yall
i hit hoes from the back and dont give a jack yall
its big l yall im livin swell yall
i do my famous spell my name ring bells yall
if you dont got endz
girls be frontin
if you dont got endz
they aint givin up nuthin
if you dont got endz
all the girls they ignore you
if you dont got endz
they act like they never saw you
if you dont got endz
