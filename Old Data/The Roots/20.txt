youll soon depart *echoes from the last track*

chorus malik b 2x

yo the feet that i walk with
the ears that i hear with the eyes that i see with
the mouth that i talk with the terror that i stalk with
now its time to spark shit

malik b
look god i walk around a little edgy already
yall mcs come into my face but my aims steady
m-illitant is skilled in most strategic plan
i float across seas and breezed across land
standin in these thoughts of murder within
the structure of this world thats corrupted with sin
im always hittin to leave mcs guessin
for any transgression in my perimeter
there will be a blessing and your explicit intoxicated
buddha session to stop stressin
me with the madness puttin niggaz on my had list
no sadness is felt you shuffled and your cards get dealt
jim carrey ass niggaz start to melt
impact like a buckle bein swung from off a belt
any help for shelter when in the realms of a welter
my weight will tilt ya hold alignments and change your filter
my attitude a product of society
so sometimes for gratitude you know you cant rely on me
niggaz eyein me with looks of they anxiety
wonderin whats in my heart velocity or piety
yo it depends on which one you bring to surface
at times i get trife but what to worship is my purpose
malik b blend with the tree to spot an enemy
you cloggin me up cat now vacant the vicinity

chorus

malik b
im symbolic to a ballot its abdul malik
dont approach with bullshit im quick to call it invalid
route through your district we keep it simplistic
no need for the rapper to talk put it on halt
show me the vault or the safe cause im on the paper chase
wade through route states for bout thirty down my waist
im tryin to get it these rain bottlin thoughts become acidic
with one in the chamber ready to aim and spit it
a girlfriend and team made nigga cash just splintered
i take what you got to give cause i got to live
the last hour i bet your assÂ 
might act up but i still can pass dowa
im usin new ways to try to reach these better days
instead of tryin to take you under i just make you wonder
i still fast make salaat and pay zakaat
i didnt make haj yet but thats my next project
livin two lives one of turn and one with true lies
keepin a hoe knowin these hands into my dua
in the quarters livin modest with my nigga trotter
i circle my foes like tawaf around the kaba
i used to live life like there was no manana
now im treatin every breath like it was your honor
im mill-itill-itant with the fifth that stand firm
like a pillar im i and t-l like manilla

chorus 2x

this is what its all about 7x
