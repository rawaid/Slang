i hear somebody screaming
again racing for the fall
close my eyes but i never wonder
i have seen it all

they dont remember
was it coming was it going
running from the sun
listen through the morning

im coming
take my chance my footsteps in the road
no one sees and no one knows
im coming
im coming
im coming

i hear somebody screaming
again racing for the fall
close my eyes but i never wonder
i have seen it all
