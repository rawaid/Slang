the sole missin link what could mcs who listen think
its black thought open your eyes and dont blink
yo to rock this mic is like a basic instinct
but yo in-in-tro-tro-duc-ducing

elo
behind thee the mic champ-ion
more than a step-ion
mothafuckers sweatin me beggin me just to get me on
macro-cosmic micro-master

black thought
aiyyo im all the way way phil phil-lay-lay
people wanna see the way the illadel play
yo look in the mirror watch what yourself say
im from s-p no mortal man can test me
thought i keep a lin-e in upper eschulone-in
heineken hold the rhymin in flows remindin em
cats that hear me up some shit from back in the past
your half-steppin ass could never fathom a grasp because 

elo
yo we got a doctrine in cold-rockin it
bringin this apocalype nigga you mad topical
*bitch* my raps trick your optical
mister superficial im rippin apart your heart tissue
this is your official dismissal
i dont study the artificial who fuckin wit the dark crystal
yo where are is you im movin like a smart missle
aimed and guaranteed to hit you

black thought
word up but when the fifth do get on and perform you in for it
it aint no way to cen-sor it my style metaphoric
to bricks and ten tons stacks hard to lift
the artist comin out the fifth darkness

elo
we go back like ancients while you aint shit
sub-terrainean never against the grain-ean
afro-american slash half-blade-ean
in your universe my stars the most radiant

chorus

black thought
aiyyo its all the way live from 2-1-5
plus admission is denied so just wait outside
two extremes collide like jekyl and hyde
and i provie you wit the swerve you need but take heed
you travellin like speed
iller than adventures you might read
o-fficial original breed the just-ice league yo its the p-5-d
style fashionist other mcs they actresses

elo
yo its the high-opposed you bout to get shot down
tryin to fly above this illa-fifth compound
youve known since the get-go i rock your disco
aint nobody badder but yo you get my gist so
i represent so you gotta squint
as far as how i do it you aint compen-sate
we causin nui-sance and get in-decent so save your two cents
dont come in my district kickin that *bullshit*

black thought
yo its all simplistic limited click get
lyrically lifted touchin the fifth shit
trenches of the mentally twisted you enlisted
5 was the emblem on the mic you got hit wit

elo
and i stomp ya till you call me conqueror
back-slappin all the niggas that slept
thinkin that elo could ever disappear
im strippin they vi near
wit this non ether reefer quiet frequent premiere

chorus 2x
