[verse 1 big krit]
i did it all for the money lord its what it seems
well in the world of night terrors its hard to dream
holln cash rules everything lets call it cream
cause when it rises to the top you get the finer things
oceanfronts rollin blunts with model chicks
and sayin grace over lobster and steak
like please forgive us for ridin benzes with camera plates
too busy lookin backwards for jackers to pump my brakes
for help sign to symbolize the lives that hunger takes
addicted to the green if i dont ball ill get the shakes
id give it all for peace of mind for heavens sake
my hearts so heavy that the ropes that hold my casket break
cause everything that wasnt for me i had to chase
i had to chase

[chorus dice raw]
they told me that the ends
wont justify the means
they told me at the end
dont justify the dreams
that ive had since a child
maybe ill throw in the towel
make my make my
make my make my
hardship from the world

[verse 2 black thought]
trying to control the fits of panic
unwritten and unraveled its the dead mans pedantic
whatever see its really just a matter of semantics
when everybodys fresh out of collateral to damage
and my splayin got me praying like a mantis
i begin to vanish feel the pull of the blank canvas
im contemplatin that special dedication
to whoever it concern my letter of resignation
fadin back to black my dark coronation
the heat of the day the long robe of muerte
that souls in the atmosphere like airplay
if theres a heaven i cant find a stairway

[chorus dice raw]
they told me that the ends
wont justify the means
they told me at the end
dont justify the dreams
that ive had since a child
maybe ill throw in the towel
make my make my
make my make my
hardship from the world
