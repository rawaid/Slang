you are all
we dont even come to see our own man
listen freddy listen
if we had to depend upon black people to eat
we would starve to death
youve been out there
you on the bandstand
you look out there what do you see
you see japanese you see you see west germans 
you see slobovic you know anything except our people man
it makes no sense it incenses me that our own people
dont realize our own heritage our own culture
this is our music
thats bullshit
why
thats all bullshit everything everything you just said is bullshit
youre complaining about-
im talking about the audience
thats right
the people dont come because you grandiose motherfuckers dont play
shit that they like if you played the shit that they liked 
then the people would come
simple as that

inevitably hip-hop records are treated as though they are disposable
they are not maximized as product not to mention as art
