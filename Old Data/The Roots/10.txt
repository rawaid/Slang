first thing they teach us not to give a fuck

[black thought - rapping]
yo 
when you on the corners theres too much drama 
livin with the police right behind ya
its always more than a slight reminder 
we livin in a war zone like rwanda 
before i go back to the heavenly father 
pray for me if it aint too much bother 
whatever dont break me a-make me stronger 
i feel like i cant take too much longer
its too much lyin and too much fightin 
im all cried out cause i grew up cryin 
they all got a sales pitch i aint buyin 
they tryin to convince me that i aint tryin 
we uninspired we unadmired 
and tired and sick of being sick and tired
of livin in the hood where the shots are fired 
we dyin to live so to live we dyin 
you just like i am

[black thought - singing]
somebodys gotta care
and i swear it isnt fair
in suspended animation we aint tryin to go nowhere
out here in these streets were so young and all alone
we aint even old enough to realize were on our own
livin life in these hard streets
where its like they lost they mind
is there anyway to find
are we runnin out of time out here

when you whylin out runnin round in these streets
