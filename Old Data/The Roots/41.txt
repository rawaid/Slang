yo mountain high and valley low and river winding to the beat
i have traveled chasing demons screaming all i find i keep
if you dont pay like you lay alright okay thats fine with me
ima just spray my heat and say my piece and lay you down to sleep
aint nobody tell you clowns to speak
im an ak you down the street
draw that bump thats built for the riots see how quiet yall can keep
aint no wilding it aint no problem
it aint no question it aint no beef
cut that check then things are sweet
ima go buy some diamond teeth
ill be damned if my setback gonna help you get back on your feet
no surrender no retreat
nigga we out here trying to eat
hashtag diamond dog tag
money bag nice swag pockets need an ice bag
toe tag body bag
niggas lose their lives sad
rockets in their flight path
breaking bad make them bad
choices out here thinking fast
smoking wet and drinking bad
soaking wet and sinking fast
shoot them niggas making cash
stick them niggas take their stash
the law of gravity meets the law of averages
aint no sense in attempting to civilize savages
even though i wish i could be spared my embarrassment
im a nigga other niggas pale in comparison
we out in paris yet but still a nigga perishing
no idea how much times left fuck trying to cherish it
a life in times unchecked now thats american
inherit the wind pressure in everything

the world aint ready for someone like me
and life is sex stress drama and im hookin out 3
id rather od than be the next og
than fronting for a whore that already chose me
one man revolution thats supportin prostitution
im trying pimp the game where balling dont mean hooping
and riding dont mean cruising
it mean keep your bitch-ass moving
if you aint built for bruising redrum aint in your blueprint
in a jungle made of concrete every animal jumanji
on easy-e and pcp ass-cash or ebt
how you monetize pigeons on a power line
on a road to the riches every dudes a dollar sign
i dont mind i dont mind long as all the smoke is mine
and the liquor store delivers faster than a papa johns
and i heard that def-ass caller moneys on the other line
the last episode of good times is my life

freeze they say in the streets when the young players
get rich or die trying
but the funny thing about that phrase to me
is that these little niggas be lying
cause dont nobody wanna die
but everybody trying to get rich though
but the fucked thing about that
these lil niggas dont how to get rich so
i still run with those angels
man i still p for those angels
speaking with guns sticking in tongues
talking that arabic and that yiddish
riding them trains stashing them chains bangles
yeah i play for those gangsters
my tag on the wall you niggas look up
you can still see my name yo
how did i end up where im at
its kind of hard to explain yo
i remember all i wanted was a gold chain and a kangol
i remember all i wanted was a gold chain and some jordans too
crossed that bitch then i got that bitch
now all i want from hers an abortion
my mind filled with distortion
my eyelids say caution
yeah i sold crack to get my soul back
they say its gonna cost a fortune
and i wonder if the lord take debit
cause a nigga got real bad credit
if not i aint got a whole lot so a nigga like me just can forget it
