dear god i’m trying hard to reach you
dear god i see your face in all i do
sometimes it’s so hard to believe it…
but god i know you have your reasons
uh huh

[verse 1]

they said he’s busy hold the line please
call me crazy i thought maybe he could mind read
who does the blind lead
show me a sign please
if everything is made in china are we chinese

and why do haters separate us like we siamese
technology turning the planet into zombies
everybody all in everybody’s dirty laundry
acid rain earthquakes hurricane tsunamis

terrorist crime sprees assaults and robberies
cops yellin’ stop freeze
shoot him before he try to leave
air quality so foul i gotta try to breath
endangered species
and we runnin’ out of trees

if i could hold the world in the palm of these
hands i would probably do away with these anomalies
everybody checkin’ for the new award nominee
wars and atrocities
look at all the poverty

ignoring the prophecies
more beef than broccoli
corporate monopoly
weak world economy
stock market topplin’
mad marijuana oxycotton and klonopin
everybody out of it

[hook]

well i’ve been thinkin’ about
and i’ve been breakin’ it down
without an answer

i know i’m thinking out loud
but if you’re lost and around
why do we suffer
why do we suffer
uh huh

[verse 2]

yeah… it’s still me one of your biggest fans
i get off work
right back to work again
i probably need to go ahead and have my head exam
look at how they got me on the def jam payment plan

well i’m in the world of entertainment and
trying to keep a singing man sane for the paying fans
if i don’t make it through the night slight change of plans
harp strings angel wings and praying hands

lord forgive me for my shortcomings
for going on tour and ignoring the court summons
all i’m trying to do is live life to the fullest
they sent my daddy to you in a barrage of bullets

why is the world ugly when you made it in your image
and why is livin’ life such a fight to the finish
for this high percentage
when the sky’s the limit
a second is a minute every hour’s infinite

[outro]

dear god i’m trying hard to reach you
dear god i see your face in all i do
sometimes it’s so hard to believe it
