black thought

mos def

all you high noon riders better rally at the summit
its me and tariq and your fleet outnumbered
cross the membrane barkin big game and get hunted
eyewitness account say it happened so sudden
just slid off to the side didnt really say nuttin
then blaow blew away the 1900th

black thought

mos def

of the black thought and the black man from black star
illadelph and vietnam we conference accomplish
even with stakes inclined i get mine regardless

black thought
yo a lot of smurfette mcs carry purses
and rock uniforms thats made for nurses

only touchin surface the fucks the purpose

mos def

and make sure beans dont burn in the kitchen
these gased up niggas just aint fuel efficient
i play the winter breeze then choke hold your prisoner
now you niggaz cant make pole position
classy chasis cant hold the transmission
crew pit useless they got they tools missin
watch me grand prix champy for wealth driven

black thought
yo you go one for my hustle hustle
two to rock rhyme two to rock rhyme
from the muscle kid im one of the illets of all time
i swing from chandeliers and wall climb
and specialize in warfares of all kind
a lot of mcs said im a run it down rhyme
but half the time they run it down one of mine
thought suffocatin em with yet another stunnin line
you dumb and blind kid its enlarged and underlined

mos def
what i memorized leave your whole staff pressurized
melt down all of your artificial lies
yall niggaz is faker than yellow no 5
swine like mono and diglyceride
my vocals got texture you just texturized
im nicer than your writtens even when im improvised
step into my zone get flown like fly
by the b-boy lazarus who just wont die

black thought
yo me and kamal and leanord hubbardÂ uestlove and malik
we go back to dollar holdings and tahitian treat
or like toast in the oven with government cheese bubblin
me and dante like marvin the troublemen travellin

b-boy business off the top actin and battlin
servin them cats that forgot
but dont get too close because you might get shot

both interwined
like blaow-ba-dow-da-da-dow-da-dah-ow
either stand tall or sit the fuck down
all the way from the 2-1-5th to bucktown

mos def
say heres a little story that must be told
about two young brothers who got so much soul
they takin total control of the body and brain
flyin high in the sky on a lyrical plane
its just two bad brothers who will never quit
mos def and tariq from the 2-1-5th
they rock beginnin to end on a spiritual blend
and everybody who forgot then baby tell em again
its just me and tariq with ahmir on the beat
the roots crew baby yo we got to make it unique
we got the soul-shockinest body-rockinest
non-stoppinest _fortified live_ survive the apocalypse
rhymes we say the perfect blend
because we know how to rock when the beat come in
