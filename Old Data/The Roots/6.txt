[chorus aaron livingston]
like when autumn leaves fall
down from the trees
there goes my honey bee
i’ve lost a lot of sleep to dreams
and i do not miss them yet
i wouldn’t wish them on than worst of enemies
let them burn go from here
like when autumn leaves

[verse 1 black thought]
to catch a thief who stole the soul i prayed to keep
insomniac bad dreams got me losing sleep
i’m dead tired my mind playing tricks deceit
a face in the glass unable to admit defeat
all that i am all that i was is history
the past unraveled adding insult to this injury
i’m fighting the battle for the soul of the century
destiny is everything that i pretend to be
look and what i did came back to me eventually
the music played on and told me i was meant to be awake
it’s unresolved like everything i had at stake
illegal activity controls my black symphony
orchestrated like it happened incidentally
oh there i go from a man to memory
damn i wonder if my fam will remember me

[chorus aaron livingston]
i’ve lost a lot of sleep to dreams
and i do not miss them yet
i wouldn’t wish them on than worst of enemies
let them burn go from here
like when autumn leaves
