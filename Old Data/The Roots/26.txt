hey whats for breakfast
same as yesterday
oh thats right cheeseburger and a 40 ounce
hey whats for dinner nothing nigga
but last night i had dreams of a porterhouse
for real for real i feel like
cattle in a slaughterhouse
but fuck that grow another heres a quarter ounce
it aint no hydro but it gets you high though
them niggas look like casper what the fuck do i know

at the end of this tunnel its red and blue lies
you got to pay the price you can never do right
one thing i know all i did is wrong
maybe there aint nowhere i belong
the only thing in front of me is a bullet in the head
they hoping one day that they find me dead
until then i make a place in this world
for me and my baby girl

yo the dead drop way until the am
mumbo jumbo niggas onomatopoeian
call it how i see them aint no rhyme or reason
im on some different bullshit everyday just like per diem
i damn with animal anguish
so love no bitch die richer than language
guilty of sin depending on the reeds shaking in the wind
just a question never answered out here looking for its end

at the end of this tunnel its red and blue lies
you got to pay the price you can never do right
one thing i know all i did is wrong
maybe there aint nowhere i belong
the only thing in front of me is a bullet in the head
they hoping one day that they find me dead
until then i make a place in this world
for me and my baby girl
