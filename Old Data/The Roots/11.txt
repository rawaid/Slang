[verse 1 black thought]
i drew a 2 of hearts from a deck of cards
a stock trick from my empty repertoire
another hopeless story never read at all
i’m better off looking for the end where the credits are
it’s a pain living life against the grain
i’m looking back and y’all look the same
troy mark and little what’s his name
memory is rerunning it all
it’s the flight of my fall and it’s right on the wall

[chorus]
i remember
can you remember
how it was
i do
remember
do you
[x2]

[verse 2 black thought]
i used to ride the train to the same two stops
and look at the graffiti on the rooftops
like the same song playing on the jukebox
joint called faded polaroids in a shoebox
regardless to what the cadence is
it can’t be forgotten like old acquaintances
i realize how depressing of a place it is
and when i notice my reflection whose face it is

[chorus]
i remember
can you remember
how it was
i do
remember
do you
[x4]

[verse 3 black thought]
it’s only human to express the way you really feel
but that same humanity is my achilles’ heel
a leopard can’t change his spots and never will
so i’m forever ill now i can never chill
what’s keeping me from breaking out like benadryl
when my baptism of fire resulted in a kill
sometimes it’s as cut and dry as a business deal
you gotta cause the blood of a close friend to spill
but you remember still
