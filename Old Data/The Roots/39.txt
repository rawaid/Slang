if you can‘t swizzim then ya bound to drizzown
passing out life jackets bout to go didown
get down with the captain or go down with the ship
before the dark abyss i’m gon’ hit you wit’ dis

[chorus dice raw]
and no one’s in the lighthouse
you’re face down in the ocean
and no one’s in the lighthouse
and it seems like you just screamed
it’s no one there to hear the sound
and it may feel like there’s no one there
that cares if you drown
face down in the ocean

[verse 1 dice raw]
smoking cheap weed sipping on cheap vodka
you pick your poison down davey jones’ locker
it’s rum we be wanting by the tons my consumption
take a look at my lungs and my liver it’s disgusting
take a look at the man in the mirror we start fussing
only one person gets hurt when throwing the punches
me and the man behind the glass just laughs
the waves come over my head and just crash
my hand start bleeding water starts receding
a feeling comes into my heart i start believing
that i actually might survive through the evening
survive on my own thoughts of suicide that’s competing
with thoughts of tryna stay alive which been weakened
by the feeling of putting on a smile while being beaten
the fear of drowning still diving in the deep end
the waters carried me so far you can’t reach ‘em
and it feels like there’s no one

[chorus dice raw]
no one’s in the lighthouse
you’re face down in the ocean
and no one’s in the lighthouse
and it seems like you just screamed
it’s no one there to hear the sound
and it may feel like there’s no one there
that cares if you drown
face down in the ocean

[verse 2 black thought]
after the love is lost
friendship dissolves and even blood is lost
where did it begin the way we did each other wrong
troubled water neither one of us could swim across
i stopped holding my breath now i am better off
there without a trace and you in my head and all
the halted motion of a rebel without a pause
what it do is done till you dead and gone
the grim reaper telling me to swim deeper
where the people go to lo and behold the soul keeper
i’m not even breaking out in a sweat or cold fever
but i’m never paying up on my debt or tolls either
i’ll leave the memories here i won’t need them
if i stop thinking and lie now that’s freedom
your body’s part of the maritime museum
face down in the past is where i’m being

[chorus dice raw]
and no one’s in the lighthouse
you’re face down in the ocean
and no one’s in the lighthouse
and it seems like you just screamed
it’s no one there to hear the sound
and it may feel like there’s no one there
that cares if you drown
face down in the ocean

[dice raw]
if you can‘t swizzim then ya bound to drizzown
passing out life jackets bout to go didown
get down with the captain or go down with the ship
before the dark abyss i’m gon’ hit you wit’ dis
