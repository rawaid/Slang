*the game of chess is like a swordfight
you must think first before you move
toad style is immensely strong and immune to nearly any weapon
when its properly used its almost invincible*

[verse six masta killa]
homicides illegal and death is the penalty
what justifies the homicide when he dies
in his own iniquity its the
master of the mantis rapture comin at cha
we have an apb on an mc killer
looks like the work of a master
evidence indicates thats its stature
merciless like a terrorist hard to capture
the flow changes like a chameleon
plays like a friend and stabs you like a dagger
this technique attacks the immune system
the styles like alive paralyzin the victim
you scream as it enters your bloodstream
erupts your brain from the pain these thoughts contain
movin on a nigga with the speed of a centipede
or ninja any motha fuckin contender

[chorus method man]
my peoples are you with me where you at
in the front in the back killa-bees on attack
my peoples are you with me where you at
smokin meth hittin cats on the block with the gats
