intro roxanne

its wu motherfuckers ah wu-tang motherfuckers 3x
its wu ah goin on

verse one the genius/gza

reunited double lp were all excited
struck a match to the underground industry ignited
from metaphorical parables to fertilize the earth
wicked niggaz come try to burglarize the turf
scattin off soft-ass beats them niggaz rap happily
tragically that style deter-iate rapidly
uncompleted missions throwin your best known compositions
you couldnt add it up if you mastered addition
where i come from gettin visual is habitual
de-mon-strate walkin on hot coal in rituals
i splash the paint on the wall it formed the mural
he took a look saw the manifestation of it was plural
rhymin while impaired dart hit your garment
pierced your internal streamlined compartments
just consider the unparallel advantage
of a natural disaster thats impossible to manage

verse two ol dirty bastard/osirus

bitch ass niggaz counterfeit the funk
i smoke the bead and the skunk tree top of the trunk
moonshine drunken monk yahead get shrunk
the touch of skunk i be fuckin bitches by the chunk
my name black do words wanna play in my dirt
bitch stop my momma serve free lunch from the church
i come like a thousand doves
bitch you quiet at the bus makin the fuss i gots tough love
unglove the news watch a nigga transfuse
dirty add to the fuse heavy at the booze
i dont walk i get carried
gold and platinum frisbees on my wall lookin properly
but come-ly i ufo you wright brothers
the indian that sold manhattan to the white man
my grandfather step up and get knocked right the fuck out
come to the cook-out dirty bitch at the mouth
you scared  run around like a plane about to crash

*sound of a plane crashing and explosion*

roxanne wu-tang motherfuckers 2x
yeah and rza

verse three rza

yo yo the riddler funny bone tickler freak caligula
bigger dick sex enigma pistol fertilize your stigma
stinkbox order from pink dot
mcs get stuck on ink blots as i plug to the sinkbox
wu-tang incorp take your brain on spacewalk
talk strange like b-jork great hero jim thorpe
how can i put it  life is like video footage
hard to edit directors that never understood it
im too impulsive my deadly corrosive dosage
attack when you least notice through explosive postage
i dont play the rap souflee sautee for the day
ruler zig-zag-zig a leg leg arm head
spread like plague we drink hennessee by the jig
i got the golden egg plus the goose
eighty proof absolut mixed with cranberry fruit juice
ginseng boost i got yo neck in a noose
keep my money wrinkled the rap star twinkle killer instinct
sixteen bar nickle sell more copies than kinko
grow like a fetus with no hands and feet to complete us
and we return like jesus when the whole world need us

verse four method man/iron lung

is it appetite for destruction
slap a murder rap on this production i touch somethin trust nuttin
iron lung/twisted metal
i see em duckin my dart gun bustin from every angle
worldwide total carnage the sickest flow
that be code named agent orange killin you slow
its only right you pay homage
to those thats bout to blow like that shit up your nose solid
as a rock when i strike target ver-bal
be screamin on you like a drill sargeant her-bals
got me where i wanna be right now dont know the time
check the hour on your sundial watch me shine
drunk off of cheap wine
each line be on point when i speak mine
on behalf of my crew suuuuuuuuuuu enter the wu
thirty-six more deadly chambers to take you through
