on 34th street in the square of herald
i gamed ella the bitch caught a fitz like gerald --
-- ine ferraro whos full of sorrow
cuz the hoe didnt win but the sun will still come out tomorrow
and shine shine shine like gold mine
here comes the drunk monk with a quart of ballentine
pass the bone kid pass the bone
lets get on this mission like indiana jones the gza
one who just represent the wu-tang click
with the game and soul of an old school flick
like the mack and dolemite who both did bids
claudine went to cooley high and had mad kids
so stop the life you save may be your motherfuckin own
ill hang your ass with this microphone
make way for the merge of traffic
wu-tangs comin thru with full metal jackets
god squad thats mad hard to serve
come frontin hard then bernhard goetz what he deserves

chorus

gza
the response while i bomb that ass you aint shit
your wack ass town had you gassed
egos is somethin the wu-tang crush
souped up niggaz on a stage get rushed
i dont give a god damn on the shows you did
how many rhymes you got or who knows you kid
cuz i dont know ya therefore show me what you know
i come sharp as a blade and i cut you slow
you become so pat as my style increases
whats that in your pants ahhh human feces
throw your shitty drawers in the hamper
next time come strapped with a fuckin pamper
how ya sound b  youre better off a quitter
im on the mound g and its a no-hitter
and my dj the catcher hes my man
anyway hes the one who devised the plan
he throws the signs i hook up the beats with clout
i throw the rhymes to the mic and i strike em out
so it really doesnt matter on how you intrigue
you cant fuck with those in the major leagues
