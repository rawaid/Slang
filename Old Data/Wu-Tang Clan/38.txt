shake them niggaz
scary hours no money out smash the guinness stout
play the outfield lucille switched cracks on shields
shes a rich fiend sacrifice her fam shift them niggaz
to queens guess jeans she charged thirty-five beans
hit the cell phone regulate with well known tone
a wally kingpin who also slam and strike edition
whattup corleone smoke the bone tone phone me
whattup he tried to slang there address him with chrome only
grady with the gray beard transport for him
rockin nike at rastafarianburg pipin that
switchin benzes ten carat nigga with gold lenses
frontin like hes sittin on a lump hes sittin on junk
you wanna pull a heist draw guns and robberies
you wanna rock rep step in yellow wallabies
names arraigned the century fox little glocks
them niggaz with stocks wail on your blocks
rich lifestyle small like an ordinary white child
but right now son is still shine shed light now
breakdown liquidate god fuck it grab the nickel plate
spencer for hire tension when we mention dryer
hes a slave cop behave pop
blue suits who bay stop us blow that cat
at the purple haze spot

method man
i remember stickin fiends at the one-six-ooh
when we was starvin duckin five-oh payin em dues
times is hard in the slums im from they got us barred in
we warrin and cage dodgin rippin and robbin
got the narc sabotagin slippin cracks in
your camoflougin now you snitchin on the squadron
thats somethin niggaz cant pardon
city overrun by young gun with bad intention and wu-wear garment
so i see no need to mention the potency
of a sting from a killa bee kickin the battery
out the back of them wisecracks
distorted for your get high you hijack
these friendly skies aint for you they for me and mine
this the year of the grimy nigga ragtime
keep these niggaz on the run peep my clan emblem
iron lung aint got to tell you where its comin from

catch us swimmin with these sharks now you rap villains
i feel the same way you niggaz feelin
we feel the same way you feelin let it be known let it be known
*together* what the blood clot you niggaz dealin you crash dummies
cash rules still dont nuttin move but the money

ghostface
aiyyo strongarm that kid right there with wavy hair
billy johnson snatched him out his whip in times square
took his pumas nameplate dude lost weight
summer eighty-eight started a fight that cant wait
ask dorothy same kid pussy up in marsey
blazin that tad rossi up in the marquis
he lost like a hundred ounces jake rushed his houses
had him on the porch ass no trousers
this souped up individual stuck the new stuff
same kid cryin on the stand with judge cuffner
kissed him with art num its three to nine style
before he left he flashin his face like denzel
richard dale took his beaver off the wall pullin his whip
mussy dropped and split his wig with the heater
his safe butt was all fucked up as he had me laughin
god you see how he was laid out in the grass
with dirt in his mouth slim woke him up told him he wild out
blood leakin from his teeth he smiled like he gunned out
big bolo stackin his shit financed a volvo
he copped his shit from a small coffeeshop in soho
he still pussy he sell his dust up on the lower east
posin like he rappin out
