aint sayin cash bite my style ill bite your motherfuckin ass

ghostface killah
for cryin out loud my style is wild so book me
not long is how long that this rhyme took me
ejectin styles from my lethal weapon
my pen that rocks from here to oregon
heres mordigan catch it like a psycho flashback
i love gats if rap was a gun you wouldnt bust back
i come with shit thats all types of shapes and sounds
and where i lounge is my stompin grounds
i give a order to my peeps across the water
to go and snatch up props all around the border
and get far like a shootin star
cause who i are is dim in the light of pablo escobar
point blank as i kick the square biz 
there it is youre fuckin with pros and there it goes

rza
yo chill with the feedback black we dont need that
its ten oclock hoe where the fucks your seed at
feelin mad hostile ran the apostle
flowin like christ when i speaks the gospel
stroll with the holy roll then attack the globe with the buckus style
the ruckus ten times ten men committin mad sin
turn the other cheek and ill break your fuckin chin
slayin boom-bangs like african drums well be
comin around the mountain when i come
crazy flamboyant for the rap enjoyment
my clan increase like black unemployment
yeah anotha one dare g-gka-genius
take us the fuck outta here

genius
the wu is too slammin for these cold killin labels
some aint had hits since i seen aunt mabel
be doin artists in like cain did abel 
now they moneys gettin stuck to the gum under the table
thats what yeh get when ya misuse what i invent
your empire falls and ya lose every cent
for tryin to blow up a scrub
now that thought was just as bright as a 20-watt light bulb
should of pumped it when i rocked it
niggaz so stingy they got short arms and deep pockets
this goes on in some companies
with majors theyre scared to death to pump these
first of all whos your a&amp;r
a mountain climber who plays an electric guitar
but he dont know the meanin of dope
when hes lookin for a suit &amp; tie rap
thats cleaner than a bar of soap
and im the dirtiest thing in sight
matter fact bring out the girls and lets have a mud fight

*sounds of fighting*

rza you best protect ya neck
meth watch ya step kid
