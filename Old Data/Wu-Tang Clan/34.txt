method man
apocalypse now mind over matter 
next batter be tical put it on a platter 
how much uncut raw shit we dealin wit 
murder track what slang killin it touched
you feelin it in your bloodstream deadly venomous elixir 
hammer like sledge that be sister
all in together now follow me the mista
meth candyman farewell to the flesh
death come in the scripture two-thousand one
bring the rap arma-gedde-on let it be known
when you walk up in this dead zone wit all that wack shit 
now you know you dead wrong one thousand lashes

raekwon the chef
detonate that pussy massengil rap cleanse that
the kids rank snatch collars off while ridin off
float boat big boys oakland as stashed away blades
ventilation let the sharks ani-maze
somethin sheist like seven butcher knives rollin rover style twice 
finger itchy like lice hair fell out somethin to conquer 
stomp ya like that cat blanca
toy tonka truck ten carat on ya monsta
ring rocky like fuck switch sides like water rides
the dat bubble life preserve the other guys
now fuck yall act wilda the style wilda 
than a praying mantis chillin like *long inhale*

masta killa
as my brothers and i reign rebellious changin
the courses of time devils no longer exist
as god cypher divine all minds one no question
now check it
perhaps we can go through lessons
or might shot me a pussy protestin
comin with that lip professin you must take allah for fool 
wheres his jewel was he usin mathematics as a tool
tell me the struggle is god and i came to build
shit is so real inside you distilled
back in the form of mist
you wishin you did the knowledge before speakin
seekin where you went wrong
and why would i bring you such physical harm

inspectah deck
yo mind arson my squadren surround the sound-garden
guns for hire plus you under fire and a target
sniper in the cypher i pied piper
move the housing by the thousand i watched out the chrysler
bombs strike ya like the mighty thor blast the door
recite a page like a tidal wave past the shore
two pulls im wild like mechanical bulls
pack a full house its girls night out pull a hairful
heavenly laced stimulation make you feel slow paced
i motivate and await my sober state

ghostface killah
magnificent heavenly the god stay bent
five percent range whippin soul controller of the lynch
mackin phone rings stephen king trauma down at danzine
my mood swings suplexed off the rope magazine
coconut jewels wore no color shoe knife annual
moses lost his sandal hidin the manual
blow the vandal buggin off of bon jovi hits
grammer lo-ve famous murder weapon was a trophy
seize posin in oshkosh guzzle cries
sabotage massage rap bandit at large
wolverine carnation milk wu denim jeans
thurston howell the third kids back on the scene
call it chopped meat cause every word is choppy
my logic crunch all crows to death kobiyashi couldnt stop me
gettin caught up in my world h√§agen-dazs world
backflip and then twirl cave your whole world in
