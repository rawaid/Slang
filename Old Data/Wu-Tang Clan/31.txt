though im tired of bustin off shots havin to rock knots 
runnin up in spots and makin shit hot 
id rather flip shows instead of those 
hangin on my living room wall my first joint and it went gold 
i want to lamp i want to be in the shade plus the spot light 
gettin my dick rubbed all night 
i wanna have me a phat yacht 
and enough land to go and plant my own sess crops 
but for now it just a big dream 
cause i find myself in the place where im last seen 
my thoughts must be relaxed be able to maintain 
cause times is changed and life is strange 
the glorious days is gone and everybodys doin bad 
yo mad lives is up for grabs 
brothers passin away i gotta make wakes 
receivin all types of calls from upstate 
yo i cant cope with the pressure settlin for lesser 
the god left lessons on my dresser 
so i can bloom and blossom find a new way 
continue to make more hits with rae and a 
sunshine plays a major part in the daytime 
peace to mankind ghostface carry a black nine nigga
