verse two inspectah deck

i puts the needle to the groove i gets rude
and im forced to fuck it up
my style carries like a pickup truck
across the clear blue yonder

blessed since the birth i earth-slam your best
cause i bake the cake then take the cake
and eat it too with my crew while we head state to state
