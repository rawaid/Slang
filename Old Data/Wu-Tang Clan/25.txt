ol dirty bastard
what yall thought yall wasnt gon see me
im the osirus of this shit
wu-tang is here forever - motherfuckers
its like this ninety-seven
aight my niggaz and my niggarettes
lets do it like this
im a-rub your ass in the moonshine
lets take it back to seventy-nine

inspectah deck
i bomb atomically socrates philosophies
and hypotheses cant define how i be droppin these
mockeries lyrically perform armed robbery
flee with the lottery possibly they spotted me
battle-scarred shogun explosion when my pen hits
tremendous ultra-violet shine blind forensics
i inspect view through the future see millenium
killa beez sold fifty gold sixty platinum
shacklin the masses with drastic rap tactics
graphic displays melt the steel like blacksmiths
black wu jackets queen beez ease the guns in
rumble wit patrolmen tear gas laced the function
heads by the score take flight incite a war
chicks hit the floor diehard fans demand more
behold the bold soldier control the globe slowly
proceeds to blow swingin swords like shinobi
stomp grounds and pound footprints in solid rock
wu got it locked performin live on you hottest block

method man
as the world turn i spread like germs
bless the globe with the pestilence da hard-headed never learn
its my testament to those burned
play my position in the game of life standing firm
on foreign land jump the gun out the frying pan into the fire
transform into the ghostrider a six-pack
in a streetcar named desire who got my back
in the line of fire holdin back what
my people if you wit me where the fuck you at
niggaz is strapped and they tryin a twist my beer cap 
its court adjourned for the bad seed from bad sperm 
herb got my wig fried like a bad perm; what the blood- 
clot we smoke pot and blow spots
you wanna think twice i think not
da iron lung aint got ta tell you where its coming from
guns of navarrone tearin up your battle zone rip through your slums

cappadonna
i twist darts from the heart tried and true
loot my voice on the lp my team is on to slang rocks
certified chatterbox vocabulary donna talking
tell your story walking
take cover kid what run for your brother kid
run for your team and your six cant rhyme groupies
so i can squeeze with the advantage
and get wasted my deadly notes reigns supreme your fort is basic 
compared to mine
domino effect arts and crafts
paragraphs contain cyanide take a free ride 
on my dart i got the fashion catalogues 
for all yall to all praise to the gods

ol dirty bastard
the saga continues
wu-tang wu-tang

u-god
olympic torch flamin we burn so sweet
the thrill of victory the agony defeat
we crush slow flamin deluxe slow
for- judgement day cometh conquer its war
allow us to escape hell glow spinnin bomb
pocket full of shells out the sky golden arms
tune spit the shit immortal combat sound
the fake false step make the blood stain the ground
a jungle junkie vigilante tantrum
a death kiss cap off squeeze another anthem
hold it for ransom tranquilised with anesthetics
my orchestra graceful music ballerinas
my music sicily rich california smell
an axekiller adventure paint a picture well
i sing a song from sing-sing sippin on ginseng
righteous wax chaperone rotating ring-king

rza
watch for the wooden soldiers c-cypher punks couldnt hold us
a thousand men rushing in not one nigga was sober
perpendicular to the square we stand bold like flare
escape from your dragons lair--in particular
my beats travel like a vortex 
through your spine to the top of your cerebral cortex
make you feel like you bust a nut from raw sex
enter-through-your-right-ventricle-clog-up your bloodstream high terminal 
like grand central station program fat baselines on novation
getting drunk like a fuck im duckin five-year probation

gza
war of the masses the outcome disastrous
many of the victims families save they ashes
a million names on walls engraved in plaques
those who went back received penalties for their acts
another heart is torn as close ones gone
those who stray niggaz get slayed on the song

masta killa
the track renders helpless and suffers from multiple stab wounds
and leaks sounds thats heard
ninety-three million miles away from came one
to represent the nation this is a gathering
of the masses that come to pay respects to the wu-tang clan
as we engage in battle 
the crowd now screams in rage 
the high chief jamel-ah-rief takes the stage
light is provided through sparks of energy
from the mind that travels in rhyme form
giving sight to the blind
the dumb are mostly intrigued by the drum
death only one can save shell from
this relentless attack of the track spares none

ghostface killah
yo yo yo fuck that look at all these crab niggaz laid back
lampin like them gray and black pumas on my mans rack
codeine was forced in your drink you had a navy dream 
salamander fiend bitches never heard you scream
you two-faces scum of the slum i got your whole body numb
blowing like shalamar in eighty-one
sound convincin thousand dollar court by convention
hands like sonny liston get fly permission 
hold tha fuck up allah fasten your wig bad luck
i humiliate separate the english from the dutch
its me black noble drew ali came in threes 
we like the genovese is that so caesar needs the greens
its earth ninety-three million miles from the first
rough turbulence the waveburst split the megahertz

raekwon
aiyyo dats amazing gun in your mouth talk verbal foul hawk
connect thoughts to make my man shai walk
swift notarizer wu-tang all up in the high-riser
new york gank adviser world tranquilizer
just the dosage delegate my clan with explosives
while my pen blow lines ferocious
mediterranean see ya the number one traffic sit down the beat god
then delegate the god to see god
the swift chancellor flex the white-gold tarantula
track truck diesel play the weed god substantiala
max mostly undivided then slide it its sickening
guaranteed made em jump like rod strickland
