u-god 
yo yeah
dont erase none of that good shit in the beginnin
yo spill drinks on ya get stank on ya
yo yo pinky ring shit yo
that pinky ring shit yo

its that pinky ring shit the legend of masked kid
shoot out the speakers when my guns get jurassic
superbad who am i  dolemite classic
the vandals back hands on angela bassett
i handle my plastic gunplay i mastered
no coke dope mixed down with acid on record
broken down and crafted in seconds
ladys choice the golden voice still peppered
better respect it bitch believe
i pull rabbits out the hat tricks up my sleeves
i air out the showroom the shit can breathe
fix your weave behold my expertise

chorus wu-tang clan
i got my uzi back
you dudes is wack
face it the wu is back
x2


raekwon the chef
take it back to the people leanin gettin rec room punch
we in them authentic alley switchin joints
major general niggas five stars
both arms rock when coke dropped we read a hundred niggas palms
silencers garbage bags of hash
for every cop we paid retired now the nigga on smash
gash you out your burner fast
you swing down hatin me now respect get your fingers off the glass

chorus

ghostface killah
yo what the fuck yo  yo what the fuck yall comin for
get the fuck away from my door
we got big guns in here coke over there
with blue bag and e pills stashed under the chair
and theres boss hog black and white pit with the pink lips
stan thought he was soft til he bit his fingers
the shit had me dyin yo big fat nigga bleedin
big cat nigga all season
on the beach truck stuck with hawaiian ice
diamond twice the whole city thought i bought fubu
blew you authentic doo doo picture the fog iced out
eighteen karat rap between noodles

chorus

rza
up at killa bee headquarters full rips is poured up
i saw johnny sippin henny from a iced out cup
yo with the blunt two-way vibratin off the hip
i sit took three drags off the honey-dip
now what you talkin  you see my gold fronts sparkin
aint tryin to hear what you dogs be barkin
read the headline that was blast on todays post
dead king thought he could ace ghost
queen couldnt even jack monk
probably find him in doc dooms back trunk
bdoodoodoo  im up at the wu library
readin malcolms  any means necessary

method man
john john bacardi straight up hold the ice
so nice like new york they had to name him twice
name your price i black out then change the lights
give you the same advice that i gave my wife
dont fuck with mine clan give you lumps in nine
let the smoke cloud clear so the sun can shine
culture shock for some of us thats all we got
whether you ball or not you can all be shot

inspectah deck
new york new york legendary rhyme boss
code name charley horse bust with blind force
i smash set it and wreck for cash credit or check
you crabs test cant measure the threat
i dance on a nigga like my names zab judah
rap barracuda three xl kahuna
sure to get it perkin and cause a disturbance
im thirstin feel what i feel then we can merge then
creep it through the states in v8s and 12s
my weights hell fuck with me then brace yourself
the noble sir i mass mogul
known to blast vocals and move global on you locals

masta killa
this is grown man talkin coward i split your head
im from the east where the streets run red from the bloodshed
hit chef for the rice and peas
nuff respect father e tumbled at ease
my brothers cant wait to squeeze the automatic
they need wreck like a drug dealer need a addict
floatin on the 95 sting like a killer bee
your hands cant hit what your eyes cant see

gza
from dark matter to the big crunch
the vocals came in a bunch without one punch
rare glimpse from the strictly advanced proved unstoppable
reputation enhanced since the cause was probable
so you compare contrast but dont blast
through extreme depths with the pen i hold fast
watch the block thirst for one became all
shot em with the long forgotten rainfall
delivered in a vivid fashion with simplicity
the blind couldnt verify the authenticity
the rhyme came from the pressure of heat
then it was laid out on the ground to pave streets

chorus
