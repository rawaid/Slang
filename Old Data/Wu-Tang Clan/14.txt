*[background] after laughter comes tears 
after your laughter therell be tears*

[verse one the rza]
yo check yo yo 
check the script me and the gods get it ripped
blunts in the dip forty dogs in my lip
had a box boom boom the bass will blast
we was laughing at all the girls that passed
conversation brothers had begin to discuss
hey yo ra remember that kid ya bust
aw yeah he ran but he didnt get far
cause i dropped him heh heh heh heh heh ha
not knowin exactly what lied ahead
my little brother my mother sent him out for bread
get the wonder its a hot day in the summer
didnt expect to come across a crazy gunner
hey shorty check it for the bag and the dough
but he was brave looked him in the eye and said no
money splattered him bow then he snatched the bag
in his pockets then he jetted up the ave
girls screamin the noise up and down the block
hey rakeem what your little brother got shot
i ran frantically then i dropped down to his feet
i saw the blood all over the hot concrete
i picked him up then i held him by his head
his eyes shut thats when i knew he was
aw man how do i say goodbye
its alway the good ones who have to die
memories in the corner of my mind
flashbacks i was laughin all the time
i taught him all about the bees and birds
but i wish i had a chance to sing these three words

*after laughter comes tears
after your laughter therell be tears*

[verse two ghostface killer]
me and my man my ace big moe from the shelter
bout to hit the skins from this girl named thelma
now thelma had a rep that was higher than her neck
every girl from shaolin dissed her respect
we was stimmy you know how it is when youre blitzed
three oclock in the morning something gots to give
moe said hell go first i said ill take next
here take this raincoat and practice safe sex
he seemed to ignore i said be for real
shes not even worth it to go raw deal
a mans gonna do what a mans gonna do
he got butt-naked and stuck the power u
twenty minutes went by my man went out without a doubt
im not pumpin up i am airin out
hey yo he came out laughing with glory
im surprised hes still livin to tell his story
but he carried on with the same old stuff 
with stephanie like a whammy he pressed his luck
both tried to be down with opp
aint nuttin wrong but he got caught with the hiv now
no life to live doc says two more years
so after the laughter i guess comes the tears

*therell be tears*
*after laughter comes tears
after your laughter therell be tears*

*therell be*
*after laughter comes tears
after your laughter therell be tears*
