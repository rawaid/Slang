cut it off

verse one u-god

yeah yo
give me the cue
skip the introduction prosate the lip function
the junction get rushed by some grimy people bustin weed
splatter your belly like some attica fellas
use a firearm good bloods go for hard swelling
insert the spasm yes the dirty hurt has them
thoroughbred thugs insert the fantasm
verbal smarts spark the word visit my scripture
exotic wine holding nine picasso pictures
when the rhyme pivot you now limit your chance
bodyguard the lyric with unlimited stance
words seem to zing on down to beijing
when we touch down you crown renowned kings

verse two method man

theres no honor amongst theives street pharmaceutical
stack like genovese the four devil tempt madmen
but not these we profound hardcore sound
to mcs thumbs down prepare
killa bees it be warfare this the year
niggas gotta take you off of here hold the square
if we go there we go gritty
and spread fear through this rap city call the mayor
my razor sharp darts be like cold stares
the smell of fear makes my nostrils -- flare truth or dare
ask yourself can you compare
to these niggas in the hood johnny b good
or he be gone yeah
the struggle goes on youve been warned
plo from here to lebanon how many bombs
must we drop in the ninety-now
walk a mile in my shoes get the street news from meth-tical

verse three rza

you gots to be kidding you gots to be kidding
aiyyo kid you gots to be kidding my glocksll be spitting
you gots to be kidding yo

its common sense how i master my circum-fer-ence you dense
i get locked the fuck up released on my own recognizance
cant be judged young bloods bust back like scuds
wu-tang harvest one thousand notches above
mc level yo i stay high as like treble
foes who oppose get plucked like rose pedals
arresting and holding penetrate forbidden regions
wack mcs only lasted one season
the morale was low at the corral
adjective pronouns had no style yo we propose our
aim the official initial is ruler zig-zag-zig allah
all that other bullshit aint permissable
annual increase of the wu-tang manual
handles to a keyboard is true hip hop set tangible
illegible every egg aint edible
my tracks remain unforgettable like ol nat cole
got to catch this paper to buy shaquasia a glacier
throw chairs to deck a skyscraper
understand that the continents of africa and asia
and free the black man from the enslaved labor wu-tang

interlude masta killa method man raekwon

the weight of the fam is on our back and we cant fall
victim to this long hall of fame meaning nuttin
we came to punish the glutton with a substance
that cant be contained wu-tang

motherfuckers
we be seeing yall asses when we walk up in the club
yall all in the back
scared to speak the speak cause you scared
punk motherfucker we know what time it is

raekwon conversating with some people
all you been seeing is upsets in the boxing shit right
its like come on man
this nigga fucked up motherfuckin whittaker
	dang he caught whittaker

	he caught whittaker a long time ago
mike got touched

		you talkin bout he -- what he what he what he did
		told them he cut his eye in sparring

verse five ghostface killah

style adoral rap pressing david berkowitz
einstein birth to hit now nurture it
mgm front row seat tonight no gens
purified cleanse ran into some beef up in the mens
fix your sawed off wu-tang throw me off the cross
all you saw was white meat skin hangin off
these is words from the arch bishop some call it six up
the betty crocker marvel cake stakes admissor
wax janitor black jack mulligan from canada
slam dance tarantula style youse a fan of the
monopoly king slavic poetry
carnegie halls off the hook lets push through the armory
mack truck hitting soloist soul controllers
behold of the thousand teeth fist swift and boneless
