verse one ghostface killah
aiyyo i roll like a bat out of hell
evil acapells fly spittin out of my grill
before i hit the sky with springtime colors juicy as a sunkist
certain broads double dutch this they carve it in they wrist 
pales berry blazes straighten the crumbs left on the stove
clothes in my lady hair plus yours the look gold god
the old tainted bald technique
got these vestibules designer niggaz in they whips jumpin out they seats
eighteen bronzeman part ii
we like dorothy hamill on ice we in your hood we might circle 
hats down low in the range switch lanes 
change my tire peel out real loud on the stage yo 
i shitted on your hood kid i shitted on your hood 
got to your burner too late im lookin real good 
draped out shinin like a fresh fifty cent piece
your girlfriend cmere oh shit you my mans niece 
the gourmet pocket twenty bombs made of clay
sexcapades take place we fucked in forty-eight shades 
might walk up in your studio time slap your engineer
its lighter fluid to that style hand me the matches now

verse two raekwon the chef
aiyyo rainbow roley on the wrist now whats this
niggaz bless this eight and a half bally banana twist
e shakes puffin on lye feedin the seeds plate
pullin out old dirty eights to rob gates
major wake up the kid tell tales make a nigga head wake up
beats break the nigga would take off his time
honolulu status gladdest the rich rock cabbage 
and dollar vans grands that nigga mad savage 
stationary hall of justice niggaz came clumped out 
just came home now they bunked out
money be longer than triple life til the sun burn out 
thats my word move it with the burner out
fidel way of thinkin roll with the mac bent ac-10
most of my team five percent 
check what the live said rollin with guess vests pedestrians yo
holdin my nuts fuckin thousand dollar lesbians

ghost yo the older god put me on and had to rock this
both maintain three-sixty lord live prosperous
ghost it only takes a lesson a day just to analyze life
both one time in the respectable mind
repeat 2x

verse three the genius/gza
let the shot spark soon as his pit bull barks
tire scars from skid marks leaves from jams in school parks
witness forget his original statement
even in protection programs theres no escapement
gunned down we in town hit king from seven crowns
spent rounds catch him while he rhyme in the zebra lounge
wounded back in the eighty-three summer heat
up in three-oh-nine park rhymin off the drummers beat
i stalk the city streets demonstratin mic wrecks
all lookin stank i aint playin wit a full deck
and as they nervously stare i know they scared
they saw the coming of wu the neon in times square
household name assassin killa bee
mill to the grain that posess the wu trilogy
quick to spot those that bite camoflouge and blend
those that got styles they got identical twins
dont stretch the small thing copycats are finnicky
without skills they master the art of mimicry
but i go line for line on the whole page
your unspotted life on the mic is old age

*rocket fired whistles off and explodes breaking glass*
