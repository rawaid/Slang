single strike cadence slip
once ill make you my bitch
we dont want we take shit
hella zeros life elixir drenched
all i need is my fix
fuck your idols suck my dick

im on my way out
pressin down the pillow till i cant hear you breathin
for no reason
five rings on my hand

faces gag
where the fucks my true ones at
wavin high burnin freak fuck flags
takes one to no one knows how fucked i am
if i showed em theyd just run like hoes
fuck these pussies on hella zeros
two heavens is all i know
