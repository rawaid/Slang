im bouncin whoop whoop
loud and lit allen poe poe shit
im bout ta loose that blue

i cant feel hype i man kill hype
slapped to still life
actors posin plastic like token
cant fit my low end splits your ocean
obey the chosen the latent quotient raised to drogen
heavy is the head youre blowin
im fuckin flippin
minute ago wasnt schiz but now im itchin
critical condition
thought i told you not to listen
this road dont stop shiftin
im floatin im driftin

im bouncin whoop whoop
loud and lit allen poe poe shit
im bout ta loose that blue

you aint heard not my problem
past aint poppin calli curbed beyond forgotten
pervin while them clutch the bottom
feeders suck like stuck in stockton
cuttem off like drunks been clockin
least three a month prestalkin
noted symptoms hid like like laden
bin through shit like sodom
instinct man no question looped me into no direction
no footprints in this bleach i tread them dont know yet but thats expected

im bouncin whoop whoop
loud and lit allen poe poe shit
im bout ta loose that blue

caved in my ribs drug out fucked out samhain skid off bay bridge
come with me and ill unhurt you
keep all i do locked kept your move
keep all i do locked kept your move
should we be worried what im not
heard bleeders knock all types a shit
is of no consequence
im out there im out there
im pushin mojo yo yo crack back and blow yo whole set lack
the k honas ta make it clap
bouncin get up wit it

im bouncin whoop whoop
loud and lit allen poe poe shit
im bout ta loose that blue
