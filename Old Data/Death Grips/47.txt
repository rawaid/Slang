im fucking tired of all the perks
ive tried nothing everything works
for less im worth ive served my bid
all fuck life wasnt what it is
all fuck life was just a bridge
i seen some free landed some tricks
far i see high time man quit
wont let you know when i get goin
phone ring too long

phone ring too long im probably gone
ring tone jingle my swan song
ill show you how to leave well enough alone
im not this world this on cue world
i fall back concoct new worlds
i fall out in throbbing swirls
i fall until i stop this world
i fall the fuck off this world

i live down the street from youve noticed me ive never seen you
wonder what the fuck i do

dont you worry impossible for anything to be a big deal
im in no weary my vital post dated but clearly been ages since life had appeal
far more than fascination my second nature chant kill cause i can
this body by my own hands
my friends and family wont understand
so i stay in the end dont make none to me
if wasnt for them id make that decision on gp
had to do it all again id make that decision on gp

all the nights i dont die for you
wouldnt believe how many nights i aint died for you on gp
not that i care id be a liar if i sat here claiming id exit in a minute
but i cant say i wouldnt i have my limits
