massive procession of cold sweat
stalactite step slide through youre next
get me inside ill do the rest

figure eight strut cant be touched
subversive infiltration reign supreme in none me trust
why must them fuck them

line up back facin suspense rapes dem
one by one hot cum shot clip spray dem
life drop and waste dem in pine box laid dem ta
grime dismantled churn the fat

before me dies in scorch uprise

comin for yours lock your doors
identifier destroyer

comon stick me cut me drain me suck me drink me take me down
feel me one three make your chamber pound and drown

them thangs them thangs
dont even ask me

bear the mark take one to know lifted chin face dont show
