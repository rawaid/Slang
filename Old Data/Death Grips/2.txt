whats that
cant tell
hand held dream
shot in hell
deep space ghetto streets
show me somethin
i aint seen before
mystery hind that
death door
juke step electrocute the floor
whats the science on
flyin that high
got a no-no goin one time

creeps up behind me
over my shoulder
turn around try to see
but its nowhere
noided noided
static on my blindside

i seen footage i stay noided i seen

everybodys knowin
where ya think youre goin aint goin nowhere
satelite handle that
wit a lead pipe

who captures life
who takes whats left who stay
on that next already know my gillicutti like i told you

desensitized by the mass amounts of shit

ive seen it ive been it
cant delete it feels like jail noided full moon in da klink shinin dont sleep
surveillance post my bail

i seen footage i stay noided i seen

armored cop open fire glock
on some kid who stepped so
fast was hard ta grasp

off his shoulders in slow mo

ambulance hit and run over pedestrian in brazil
little tiger boy soldier
twist a cap back and kills noided
