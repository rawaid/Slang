its all suicide 
world of dogs 

ruthless and free 
its all suicide to me 
world of dogs 

its all suicide 

you live in hiding 
youre climbing the walls no privacy 
im trying to survive but im dying die with me 
blow out the lights take your life 
ride the falling sky with me 
falling inside of me 
its all suicide to me 
world of dogs 

its all suicide 
world of dogs gone mad 
above the law in your ass 
fire trash meltdown im not here 
im world of dogs infrared 
tear me apart left for dead 
but im not dead yet 
sickem sickem yes 

world of dogs 

ruthless and free 
its all suicide to me 
cut it 
dont tell no one no one can know come closer 
im almost over lower sinkholer 
im nothing feed me to this world of dogs 
barely breathing in this world of dogs 
foam of feral reality forming on mountains of teeth 
devour the hand spit out the leash 
crown the beast my thrones the street 
too cold to sleep i kill myself i feel no pain 
im obsolete 
world of dogs
