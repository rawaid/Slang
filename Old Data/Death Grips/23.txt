burn through it burn through it 
im not takin turns to it turns to it 
you know we burn through it burn through it 
we aint takin turns to turns to it 

coughin up sirens im firin 
krocadil lips off your smile 
quit that fidget looks suspicious 
who dat screw dat aint got my digits 

fear over pride lil boy 
flood you cant hide lil boy 
face of a woman lil boy 
tears of a child lil boy 

im rising sign of sulfur 
skeletal bell toller 
handle in each of my tentacles 
im moonshining juice dont try me 
live to feel life beat me nothing hurts 
im seething your smoke signals proceed me 
im inside my tv 
where everyone but i can see me 
why are you here 

fear over pride lil boy 
flood you cant hide lil boy 
face of a woman lil boy 
tears of a child lil boy 

burn through it burn through it 
im not takin turns to it turns to it 
you know we burn through it burn through it 
we aint takin turns to it turns to it 

you know we burn through it burn through it 
im not takin turns to it turns to it 

see myself come spin through top of you 
my flint lit slit that attitude 
lil brain got confused 
choo choo train of thought in my logic loop 

fear over pride lil boy 
flood you cant hide lil boy 
face of a woman lil boy 
tears of a child ll boy 

broken hands on all my fingers 
buckle down my knuckles like screamers 
stitch up my blown out trench with leather streamers 
i keepem hangin from my balcony shrivel in my sun 
warm piss showin through his cheap slacks this bitch is done 
open my front ragin like ive never slept 
make him cry like a baby formula on the breath 
needle of your eye lil boy 
river nile wide lil boy 
fear over pride lil boy 
flood you cant hide lil boy 
face of a woman lil boy 
tears of a child lil boy 
in a foreign land lil boy 
single file lil boy 
you know we burn through it burn through it 
we aint takin turns to it turns to it
