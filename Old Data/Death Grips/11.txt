how the trip never stops 
on and on its beyond insane 
why i set myself up 
in a ragin sea of flames 

youre fit ta learn the proper meaning of a beat down 
madness chaos in the brain 
let my blood flow make my blood flow through you mane 
you got no business questioning a thang 

never not on it leanin so hard youre ashamed 
you cant dismiss this sickness transmission huffs your brain 
exhale your will and forget i ever knew you 
fuck do you do 
fuck a man wit hips for hulu 
rack a snitch chalk and cue you 
corner pocket consume you 
too many hoes in my 
too many hoes in my muthafuckin meal 
askin if i know how a muthafucka feels 
how a muthafucka feels 
slit them choke flip them boat 
dead bitch float swollen corpse 
no remorse navigated off course 
of course i can make you scream but if you ask for more 
bullshit matador grab the floor whip it cracked to all fours 
you whimper while i check my phone 
whos next assassin roam 
music drifts i have no home 
choose this life youre on your own 

youre fit ta learn the proper meaning of a beat down 
madness chaos in the brain 
let my blood flow make my blood flow through you mane 
you got no business questioning a thang 
swallowed way too much 
couldnt handle it i fell 
down a spiral stair case winding ta hell 

fuck it now i cant quit will never be the same 
i got that attitude you got no thang 
im fit ta hurt you gives a fuck about the way i move weight 
dark matter flu state of consciousness 
straight through your wont do shit 
but beg me to do this 
again and again and again and again 
strangler clutch sine wave deconstruct 
my way or no way bangin hey makin lust 
lucid nut shake shake it up 
booyakah 
youre a bitch made to be crushed 
came like what now you crave my touch 
flat busted on front street cake cuppin 
say you wasnt lion mane 
i done been done with tame 
head hunter fuck the fame 
switch lanin ripper slangin 
hit me nuclear wind at my back 
smokin goldfish at the photo mat 
load my clap clap cant trustem never did 
what it is 

youre fit ta learn the proper meanin of a beat down 
madness chaos in the brain 
let my blood flow make my blood flow through you mane 
you got no business questioning a thang
