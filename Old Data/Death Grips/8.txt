goin back to tangier
with some jordans and a spear
post-chrisitan shit 
post chicken or the egg addiction shit
pass the sherm stick
neo-reality
be the freak you wanna see
just dont follow me
im on a journey to 
the center of three
grab your fucking chain and drag you through the bike lane
while everybodys like no

i got this pregnant snake
stay surrounded by long hairs
a plethroa of maniacs 
and spiral stairs
make your water break 
in the apple store
sink or swim who fucking cares
cut the birth cords
press send
yeah thick
gaga cant handle this shit

headed for the sammy davis wing
throw up a black hole at the entrance of linens n things 
on the way
never call it a day
visit teslas grave for the ninth time today
still on the way
bigger wigs

your shit is gone
im in your area
i know the first three numbers
im in
when you come out 
your shit is gone

youll catch a jpeg to the head
über reach
youre an intern
on wikileaks
most loved therefore most hated
come and knock on the door weve been waiting for you
game changer
reclusive aggressive
yingin and yanging noided
info warrior jack the hacker
the rolling stoner 
profit on disaster

my existence is a 
momentary lapse of reason
got the dna of gothic lemons
shred it thirteen times
out of eleven
your bad ideas are the atm
shed my skin
leave it for the homeless 
to sleep it
prodigal fuck that nautical
teachin bitches how to swim

im in your area
i know the first three numbers
im in
teachin bitches how to swim

through your k-hole
dont run
ya might slip
the tables flipped now we got all the coconuts bitch

burmese babies under each arm
screamin beautiful songs
the cray cray ultra contrarion
havin conversations 
with your car alam
when you come out 
your shit is gone
soon your crew will be servin sandwiches named after me
vietnamese style fool please
front row at the mass games

untracable by name
you speak of us in certain cicles you will be dethroned or detained
gone

im in your area
i know the first three numbers
