oh why me why me oh i mean oh why me
dont see why i need all these hands cant stand by these

all my palm lines running stretching
cross my palm like blind cross etching
palm mummified chimera filming
bronze my palm now all bronze palm now
visits some medium wont come near me
treats me like a meteor
she scares me
my bony
now now billy not really
my bony
now now billy not really

yo oi yo ouh aww billy billy not really yo raw
yo oi yo ouh aww billy billy not really yo oi yo amnesia
yo oi yo ouh aww billy billy not really yo raw
yo oi yo ouh aww billy billy not really yo oi yo amnesia

oh why me why me oh i mean oh why me
dont see why i need all these hands cant stand by these

every movement after sudden movement déjà vu abductee
sucky sucky
sticky psyche touching so many
sensory dripping dripping dripping splashing spreading happening
already
now now billy not really

oh why me why me oh i mean oh my me
dont see why i need all these hands cant stand by these
my bony
now now billy not really
my bony
now now billy not really

amnesia

yo oi yo ouh aww billy billy not really yo raw
yo oi yo ouh aww billy billy not really yo oi yo amnesia

i man tsunami feral get barreled in other worlds
no hand dead sea of pearls buried in frozen jheri curls
i man herzog shooting solitaire
no hands savoir nova shaka glare zulu somnambulist lair
flick of my wrist ouh shit ouh awhoo shit
phantom lix crude lix i man island exclusive
flick of my wrist ouh shit ouh awhoo shit
flick of my wrist awe shit aww im not shit

she tune in telly through your shriveled button pressed jaundice yellow

her vox limbo fine print in obese sharpie so sorry falsetto
youre her experiment shes your experience
