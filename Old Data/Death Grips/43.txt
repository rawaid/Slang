im smoking cigarettes in the shower when they get wet i just light another
fatal cardiac over cancer dont gimme no suffer
steal me over feel me linger until im six under
aint a fucking thing sacred when i get naked

im lighting up like vegas
all sevens king of pentacles
im chaining like its money dirty money surgeons general
as if my flesh keeps me prisoner
as if
ive been spinning chambers since the day i was born
like whats it all for
like why the fuck not
fuck if i dont get off i dont know how to be caught

i get off at all costs
im turned off
pah pow pah pow
ill fuck you off at no cost
youre turned off
pah pow pah pow

im turned off wont be back soon
look up see my nuts slap the moon
im turned off like a myth
cant look me up i dont exist
i spin the chamber tween my lips
i pull the trigger like a giff
i cant get hit ive never lost
im a rumor im turned off

my footprint precedes me follow me
im all the way over my species
my footprint so dropped its bottomless
species call my redwings apocalypse
you want this bitch i drop a bitch
snuff your bloodclot metropolis
trail of anonymous casualties
pah pow boom mastery
ive been over that glass house
all my windows blacked out
straight jacked up the fuck up
guts up man down
my man stand down
im not with it
i drop liquid
red light district
cant be finished
you never started
you run for martyr
while id push harsher
lose it more further
lose it more nerder
ha ha ha ha ha
boom boom boom boom

i get off at all cost
im turned off
pah pow pah pow
ill fuck you off at no cost
youre turned off
pah pow pah pow

take off my shirt cause it hurt form of murder
art of indifference trump consequences
like first off im turned off
pah pow pah pow

trust me you cant trust me try trust me youll see why
when i see you through the ringer my ringer catch deuce deuce
i repeat like pi my ringer catch deuce deuce divided seven times
ill lead you to where am i

i get off at all cost
im turned off
pah pow pah pow
