my stone wall its on dog gaze duct taped to the ceiling
stucco cave make me illi okay okay feel me
im in an eight high abandoned building
no daylight one midnight lamp lit 24/7
murdered out windows two exits
street or nosedive to the next life in seconds
and suicide aint my stallion
so im surrounded
geiger count it not goin out shits bout ta get kamikaze
fuck a nazi
when the world comes knocking
fuck the world fuck this body
know it wont be long now
feel my nerves wet my brow
mood in my tomb red moon heavy
sling jaw shot out the window and yell
come up and get me

im epiphanic amnesia
im in jimmy pages castle
im off the planet
echo astral
vinyl lasso
the sacto asshole
im not down for anything
fuck around and say anything

my stone wall its on dog gaze duct taped to the ceiling
stucco cave make me illi okay okay feel me
im in an eight high abandoned building
no daylight one midnight lamp lit 24/7
murdered out windows two exits
street or nosedive to the next life in seconds
and suicide aint my stallion
so im surrounded
geiger count it not goin out shits bout to get kamikaze
aaaaaah fuck a nazi

come up and get me

my life as a fuck
aint one thing i dont hate
tell me my times almost up
i will say i cant wait
put your gun to my head
ill blow smoke in your face
think you got what it takes
come up and get me

cant tell hell in my head
thirteenth bell am i dead
or in asylum pill force fed
lyin to myself all by myself
strapped down to my bed
tongue cut out the mouth of reason
and chucked off the rivers edge
think fast is it tear gas or fear masked
by figments of my fragmented mind
whos my enemy them or me
step to me and youll die
grand delusions magnified
fuck the truth wastes my time
its all good bet whats that
footsteps on the stairs
never could rest theyre always there
who are they i dont care
i just know theyre tryin ta x me
give a fuck come up and get me

come up and get me
