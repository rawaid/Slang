feel me now 

my forefinger flippin pentagrams 
left hand catch them pix by them peak facin south 
pinhole pic of my wingspan jail breakin doubt 
highest vibration ninth ring of fire crowned 
war cry feel my call hear my chamber revolve 
in your brain like the halls of amenti 
treat a bitch like a whore 
leave your pink sock at the door 
saturn level flexed 
like these fractals i coalesce 
im not takin this shit anymore 
one way in come again one way in no way out 
cheek in tongue when in doubt feel me now 
violators feedem vapors dont do me no favors 

feel me now 

drop top changaa flow go boom boom off my rockers 
rollin doom bumbata choppers 
see me through spot light cherry 
fog like nunhead no teeth mary 
dont carry on 
dont where are we how far along 
me care not dare not key my brom 
my life on a limb about to break 
im a tower pon tectonic plate 

feel me now 

why you think im havin everything youre rimmin ass for askem 
whose ass theyre rimmin when im flaggin 
load your cannon shutter flash heavy damage 
steady hand shit forget me you cant bitch 
slappin click clack tricks stretch please 
my sleeves plastic cant breath in this atmos 
fuck atlas my ego palms planets 
fuck you yeah yeah its that fuck you cant stand slip 
cut you cause i can dip 

feel me now 

im the man who press that button 
sweaty palm get caught bluffin 
fold a man into nothin for nothin 
my oxidized gold shaft floods your jugular with lucifer 
ill shoot it word feel like you swallowed jupiter 
today your city tomorrow lifting the universe 
one way in one way out 
cheek in tongue when in doubt 
feel me now
