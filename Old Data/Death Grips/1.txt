get get get get
got got got got
blood rush to my
head lit hot lock
poppin’ off the
fuckin’ block knot
clockin’ wrist slit
watch bent thought bot

[verse 1]
tail pipe draggin’ volume blastin’ bailin’ out my brain
red light flash
dem stop i smash
abraxas hydroplane massive
catch this flight flow
rainin’ madness
mastered mine and laced
the ave with black cat fish tailin’ waves of stratus
curb right ta far left lane

don’t wait for me if i care
bout anything anywhere
losin’ myself i get the stares
what i’m lookin’ at wasn’t there
wasn’t there

nothin’ out there
can’t stay inside
hit the bar sleep deprived
who drove the car
i’m still alive
up in smoke moon was low
how’d you know
didn’t say i did
whose is this you know what this is but do you know

[hook]
fly inside out
rot dem big shot simp slot shit but a one hit quick stop

[verse 2]
so many ways
ta skin the frame
remember when
first got strange
now i just think it life obey
so what comes next
right away
right away

raise the cup tilt it dry
come black cloud
cover the sky
tongue thought pupil
of your eye
sickness moves you can’t deny
lickin’ thought you mastermind
for mercy man cry

yeah i’m knowin’ and
you know why
nail thought mental
ever dem try
pigeon hole me get crucified
can’t clone this edge
what’s it cost
to lose your head
wit out end up lost
should be askin’
where’s the safe
born wit a ski mask
on my face

[hook]

[verse 3]
lycanthropic manic cycles
fire water burnin’ bibles
wake up ragin’ call a taxi
take me to the nearest city
cell light up yeah get at me make it quick though blood im busy get busy

drilled a hole into my head
pierced the bone and
felt the breeze
lift my thoughts out
dem sick bed
wit a pair of crow
skeleton wings
know nothin’ since then
it seems
been floatin’ thought
the nexus threadin’ dreams
