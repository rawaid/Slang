im feeling strange in the night
im in myself i feel im thrown into a fight
nowhere to run nowhere to hide nothins right
my skin is burning when my rock begins to speak

verse 3
i watch the sun collapse
and took up in the clizzoud
i am the lone wolf
go where i wanna
let the moon shine be the guide to the lizzight
even when i stray away the light never left me uh
i learn to follow my instinct
blinded about the light
rather that than the evil
feel another place in a room full of people
try and be the same but you know youre not a sequel

youre fate will be whatever it shall be be be be be
well fight no more
i let these things just be be be be

chorus
everytime the moon shines i become alive yeah
and everytime the moon shines i become alive yeah
