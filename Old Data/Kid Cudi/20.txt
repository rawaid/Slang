listen good i dont have nobody
but what i might feel all the sounds of sanity hoping
what i hear loops itself continuously
then i wont be afraid
nooo nooo

oh whoa whoa
why must it feel so wrong when i try and do right do right
oh whoa whoa
soaring through paradise when im closing my eyes
im mister solo dolo
oh oh oh oh oh

look at me you tell me just what you see
am i someone whom you may love or enemy
am i speaking for you and yours or someone else
i need some answers
yeah yeah

oh whoa whoa
why must it feel so wrong when i try and do right do right
oh whoa whoa
soaring through paradise when im closing my eyes 
im mister solo dolo
oh oh oh

my world turns flippin the bird
to the ones who figured me outcast no not the duo
back in shaker heights when they knew who 
dough lil brother was a strange one boo hoo
cry me a river hater look who traveled without a igloo
cold cold world wasnt fit for me at all
look at where i stand at tall
clutchin my kid cudi bizalls
mute muthafuckas back home quick pause gargle on my mayo
look at me a bit im the one you think the fail
floatin on my mind no sail ahoy ahoy

listen good i dont need nobody
this is what you feel all the sounds of insanity 
hoping what i hear loops it itself to finish me
no i wont be afraid
hey hey

oh whoa whoa
why must it feel so wrong when i try and do right do right
oh whoa whoa
soaring through paradise when im closing my eyes 
im mister solo dolo

why must it feel so right
when i know that its wrong its wrong

when will i ever learn from the words in my songs

im mister solo dolo
