hey um um um um mm
hey um um um um mm

when the days change so does my attitude
im messy at home i eat a lot of junk food
when the nights change so do my nightmares too
i dream reality is my dream

all along all along i guess im meant to be alone
all along all along i guess im meant to be alone out there on my own yea

when the weeks change the rumors change too
im addicted to highs would you like to know why

when the months change so do my love point of views
i dont want what i need what i need hates me
what i need hates me

i know all along all along i know im meant to be alone its crazy

but all along all along i knew i was meant to be alone out there on my own yeah

suppose somehow the lion hearted failed to win who will be the villain 
all the strangers voted for him

suppose somehow the lion hearted failed to smile who would be the villain 
all the strangers voted for him

all along all along i guess im meant to be alone
all along all along i guess im meant to be alone out there on my own yea
