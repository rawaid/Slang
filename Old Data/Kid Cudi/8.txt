plain pat what up

my heart thump not from being nervous
sometimes im thinking god made me special here on purpose
so all the while til im gone make my words important so
if i slip away if i die today the last thing you remember wont
be about some apple bottom jeans with the boots with the fur
baby how i dream of being free since my birth
cursed but the demons i confronted would disperse
have you ever heard of some shit so real
beyond from the heart from the soul you can feel

chorus
and if i die before i wake i pray the lord my soul to take
but please dont cry just know that i have made these songs for you
and if i die before i wake i pray the lord my soul to take
cause im ready for the funeral


my mind runs i can never catch it even if i got a head start
god please tell me i am feeling so alone way
i dont need to worry cause i know the worldll feel this nigga
blessing in disguise but i am not hiding who i am open your eyes brah
if i ever met you i appreciate the love yo
girls that i dated its ok i am not mad yo
unless you stabbed me in the heart no love ho 
this shit is so ill
play it back from the top if you recognize real

chorus x2 

im ready for the funeral im ready for the funeral

im ready for it im ready for it
