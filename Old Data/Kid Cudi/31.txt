yep
yep

shades over my eyes
make the creepers look back at themselves
sitting stuck in emotional bliss
the skinny amount of girls with coke on their gums
tap my knee
im keepin the rythym
the young and wild take chances together
they all jump up twist and groove
but no one talks lost in the motherfuckin mood

no one talks lost in the mood
no one talks sweatin it out lost in the mood

hey theres a hunger in the night
the moonlight kissing the nips on the model frame
i kissed her inner thigh
closed my eyes she began to make me fit
she like to go the mile all the while
i can see her tear bit
i forgot her name

something that sounds like penelope
may be a french twang to it
tongue was quick she was french i knew it
a lovely foreigner foreign to racism
she like the young nigga by my brown skin
my shag dog fro
im king to her
she will please her friend for me
so funny and theyll starve in the garden
naked as always honest
her hands all over my privates
lost in the mood

no one talks lost in the mood
no one talks sweatin it out lost in the mood

but no one talks lost in the motherfuckin mood
no one talks lost in the mood
no one talks sweatin it out lost in the mood
