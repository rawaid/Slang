verse 1 kid cudi 
what up how is everyone doing 
you are now in the world i am ruling 
take a minute to adjust for the wondrous 
clusterfuck of fun and enchantment 
i promise you some generation next shit 
speak for the seller who i left with 
parallel levels in the dark dark place 
tripped all you niggas to a dark dark fate 
the guy that you are with a smile up on my face 
as the sun kisses us on the foreheads gently 
gentle with the drugs heavy with the love 
ima spit this on stage watch models fill my club 
g4 flights now were off to australia 
i wanna see more of the world 
these are more than just words these are facts from a winner 

chorus cee-lo green 
this is a journey into the horizon 
hope you can see that if its real to you 
we can meet on the other side 
on the other side 
ayyy 
this is a journey into the horizon 
hope you can see that if its real to you 
then we can meet on the other side 
on the other side 

verse 2 kid cudi 
what up how is everyone feeling 
i hope you understand what youre hearing 
take a minute to roll up for the wondrous 
clusterfuck of darkness and evil 
i will play the yin and the yang for ya 
and my jeans will be off with the little skinnies 
ugraded fitted into the t 
work hard make sure i dont become a memory 
hard to press on when the memories remember me 
and they always find the perfect moment 
high speed im a minimal slum 
lost in the wind ive lost all my friends 
maybe they were never meant to be acquainted 
money seems to make everything tainted 
everybody mad cause they stuck 
one less 
took what i wanted and i did it all blunted 
oh oh 

[chorus] x2
