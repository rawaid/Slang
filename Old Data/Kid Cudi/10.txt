i sure bet my daddy proud
a little nigga wit a shaker smile
on top of the dreams is where im found

some figured i was satan bound
until i came back with a style i found
then all of the sudden they fixed their faces
cause of who i know and trail of places

that ive stepped
how many niggas wanna hate cause i left
how could you blame me and my plan of attack
cause im risking my soul attack
now im heard all over the map

only rule of thumb
it dont really matter just where you from
all that really matter is where youre gon go
maybe upstate for some

but you cant rule out these claps for gun
second chances given out for some
all you gotta do is take advantage
so maybe you can get yourself a horse and carriage
been pimpin you should think about marriage

until then get it then find yourself and lets begin
ima tell you how in a minute ima show you how i be livin
from a long time ago a young nigga he was timid
now im zone and see things so vivid

hide my soul nah homie not even
ima zone out till i lose feeling
remember ima be gone way past november
even stay up there up there
floatin floatin hopin i could find peace somewhere

in my mind it sounds like ooh
when im gone it feels like ooh

when im zone im feelin alright im feelin alright
im feelin alright
when im zone im feelin alright im feelin alright
i forget about it all

ballin is this allowed
without feelin like shallow hal
commas on the jesus piece for style
back in cleveland city we ride around

greetin my niggas wit dap and pounds
so if i fall i wont hit the ground
these are the things thatll make me smile
knowin this blunt might burn a while

i keep myself so lifted
i am accustomed to new heights
i feel perfect though they think its worthless
see without my flight

man everybody wanna be a critic
i have my life and i will live it
shut your mouth before i fuck it
ha my jokes they will love it

if im seen on the scene with my slim cut jeans
more than likely i am fadin man
doin other shit if everywhere you go
niggas aint just standin round hatin

so my advice is when the lights start flashin
ill be zonin all alone
and then the place where my mind is goin
filled with songs that no ones knowin

and the devil in a hot pink dress
tryin to ask me for one dance
he think he slick but my guardians
protect me from his wrath
so in my place no hate shall enter
livin high up there up there
copin copin floatin i will find peace somewhere

in my mind it sounds like ooh
when im gone it feels like ooh

when im zone im feelin alright im feelin alright
im feelin alright
when im zone im feelin alright im feelin alright
i forget about it all

in my mind it sounds like ooh
when im gone it feels like ooh

when im zone im feelin alright im feelin alright
im feelin alright
when im zone im feelin alright im feelin alright
i forget about it all
