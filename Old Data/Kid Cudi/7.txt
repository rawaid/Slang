verse 1
now when the sun come up
ill be there to say what up in the morning
brush my teeth
find that clip ive been looking for since last night
i feel so caught up
in the bud
i float somehow in my bedroom
turn around
see myself in the mirror i guess im cool
and those happy thoughts
in my head
im feelin like im peter pan
minus the tights and the fairies
happy to see how far ive come
to the same place
it began
my dreams imagination
perfectly at peace
so i move along a bit higher

hook
ill be up up and away
up up and away
cause
they gon judge
me anyway
so whatever
ill be up up and away
up up and away
cause in the end theyll judge me anyway
so whatever

verse 2
higher
learning
i seen the dreams ive made
so im cooler now
i can take care
of my mom and my little niece zuri
so sing along little mama
you aint
gotta worry bout no drama no
i provide for friends and fam and fans
who come to see the grindin man
stay afloat
the key is hope
i never let
a muthafucka break me dog
who gives a fuck
if a nigga dont like your steez
tell em raise off your nut’s
we dont care what people say
dudes who critique your clothes are most gay
i aint gotta wait for no one
if i wanna fly
i can fly for freedom
hey
