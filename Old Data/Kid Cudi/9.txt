i can’t decide
what if life’s a lie
i push the lames aside
they’ll learn
i can’t ever front know why
it’s not my style no lie
fuck all the talk
in time they’ll burn
i can’t decide
what if life’s a lie
i push the lames aside
they’ll learn
i can’t ever front know why
its not my style no lie
they’ll never take me alive

you love that little bit of new now throwback
cleveland city snakeskin snapback
niggas know that uniform keep the brim low
you doubt him don’t know a damn thing about him
what is hip hop without him y’all niggas really just don’t know
go all day every day hold on with all might
i gave the world my heart and they gave the kids insight
yup now fuck you i ain’t left
i’m outta my mind like all the time
and a nigga ain’t missed one step yet yep

i can’t decide
what if life’s a lie
i push the lames aside
they’ll learn
i can’t ever front know why
it’s not my style no lie
fuck all the talk
in time they’ll burn
i can’t decide
what if life’s a lie
i push the lames aside
they’ll learn
i can’t ever front know why
its not my style no lie
they’ll never take me alive

my head hurt gotta give me something that’ll make me feel good
i remember couldn’t tell a nigga nothing man i wish you would
niggas ain’t working like me i had to put my bit in
all this rose gold i’m dipped in dressed in  while i coast in clouds
that’s my life babe crystal clear no cascade
i’m going going i’m on a crusade
to save the kids from the weak shit
it’s finally my world
here all the girls can be my girl
just sit back count stacks girl
hold a nigga down all the time girl

i can’t decide
what if life’s a lie
i push the lames aside
they’ll learn
i can’t ever front know why
it’s not my style no lie
fuck all the talk
in time they’ll burn
i can’t decide
what if life’s a lie
i push the lames aside
they’ll learn
i can’t ever front know why
its not my style no lie
they’ll never take me alive
