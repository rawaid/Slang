i got 99 problems and they all bitches
wish i was jigga man carefree living
but im not sean or martin louis
im that cleveland nigga rolling with them brooklyn boys
you know what i be when you start living large
i control my own life charles was never in charge
no sitcom could teach scott about the dram or even explain the troubles that haunted my mom
on christmas time my mom christmas grind
got me most of what i wanted howd you do it mom huh
she copped the toys i would play with in my room by myself
why he by himself he got two older brothers - one hood one good
an independent older sister kept my fly when she could
but they all didnt see the little bit of sadness in me scotty

hook
ive got some issues that nobody can see
and all of these emotions are pouring outta me
i bring them to the light for you its only right
this is - the soundtrack 2 my life yeah yeah the soundtrack 2 my life oh

im super paranoid like a 6th sense
since my father died i aint been right since
and i tried to piece the puzzle of the universe
split a 8th of shrooms just so i can see the universe
i try to think about myself as a sacrifice 
just to show the kids they aint the only ones who up at night
the moon will illuminate my room and soon im consumed by my doom
once upon a time nobody gave a fuck its all said and done and my cocks been sucked
so now im in the cut alcohol in the wound my hearts an open sore that i hope heals soon
i live in a cocoon opposite of c√°ncun where its never sunny the dark side of the moon
so its more than right - i try and shed some light on a man
not many people of this planet understand fam

hook
ive got some issues that nobody can see
and all of these emotions keep pouring outta me
i bring them to the light for you its only right
this is - the soundtrack 2 my life the soundtrack 2 my life oh


im prolly this close to go and tryin some coke
and the happy ending would be slitting my throat
ignorance to cope man ignorance is bliss ignorance is love and i need that shit
if i never did shows then id prolly be a myth
if i cared about the blogs then id prolly be a jackass
dont give a shit what people talk about fam
haters shake my hand but i keep the sanitizer on deck
hope i really get to see 30
wanna settle down stop being so flirty
most of the clean faces be the most dirty 
i just need a thoroughbred cook when im hungry
ass all chunky brain is insanity
only things that calm me down - pussy and some cali tree
and i get both never truly satisfied
i am happy thats just the saddest lie

hook
ive got some issues that nobody can see
and all of these emotions keep pouring outta me
i bring them to the light for you its only right
this is - the soundtrack 2 my life the soundtrack 2 my life oh
