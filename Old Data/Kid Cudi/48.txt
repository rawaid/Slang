[chip the ripper]
a nigga like me be so gone
eyes so low that a nigga gotta throw his loaks on
wonder what them folks on
thats what they be askin
them kush we smoke some
smell it when a nigga passin
we getting to the cash and
you can see a nigga shinin
just a lil doe a couple hoes a couple 2-3 diamonds
up in the hood where youll find him
unless he out on the road
every show got a bag full of blow
and patron all my niggas gettin dough
like they supposed to
cause life is short and filled with lots of grief and doubt
so i just pour that bag of colorful frosty leaves on out
and free my scalp

i mean free my mind
one puff at a time
im up all the time
im up on the grind
so a big booty and a blunt would be fine
just wanna feel fine
just wanna kill time
just wanna relax and think of a rhyme
dont really like sippin
cause i get to trippin my nigga
just roll me a heap of that pine
and i only bring a little good for the trip
just in case we get blurred by 5-0
sir you look high
i know but i prefer my eyes low

chorus
can we get higher and higher and higher and higher
can we get higher and higher and higher and higher
you know we get higher and higher and higher
you know we get higher so higggherr

[kid cudi]
they say easy friend
there he go talkin bout weed again
probably becuz of all that weed in him
yes and no
cause and effect is what most dont know
doin bad like mike said
could be doin wrong
forget about the obvious context of the song
put your brain where it belong
cant we just all get a bong and tag along
and we float
we kids with hope
better than coke we smoke
dog please dont miss
whatta a nigga tryna get you thinking bout
we outside becuz my mama in the house
puff puff pass with yo bitchass
back in high school smoked weed when i cut class
and now im an addict
tragic stable enough for reclining
i be lookin down and see my jewels be shinin
good look yeezy
yall stay blinded
by that light
somebody pass me a shell to the right
yes im goin
i be outtie
and you can find me
ill be chilling back ill be chilling jack

chorus
can we get higher and higher and higher and higher
can we get higher and higher and higher and higher
you know we get higher and higher and higher
you know we get higher so higggherr
