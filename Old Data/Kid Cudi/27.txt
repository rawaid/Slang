yeahh wahhhh wahhhhhh
yeahh wahhhh wahhhhhh

yeahmy name is scott mescudi
yeah

gotta get it through my thick head
i was so close to being dead
yeah life live it but nobody sell tips
man im just walking without being led
see the world is so crazy and filled with such risk
and i just know i gotta pass them
the beginnings are followed by an end
in the in-between time im not running or hiding

[bridge]
see things do come around
and make sense eventually
things do come around
but some things trouble me

[chorus]
the people ive met and the places ive been
are all what make me the man i so proudly am
but i want to know one thing when did i become a ghost
im most confused about the world i live in
to think that im lonely well i probably am
one thing that still gets me
when did i become a ghost yeah

yeahh waahhhhh wahhhhh
yeahh waahhhhh wahhhhh

tried to fight it
but soon i gave in
down the road with no lights on
when you cant describe it
and you dont move like them
you become their worst nightmare
you remember the things that youre parents have said and
rather find out the hard way
you should tell a friend to tell a friend to tell a friend
i keep with my stroll im not running or hiding

[bridge]
see things do come around
and make sense eventually
things do come around
but some things trouble me

[chorus]
the people ive met and the places ive been
are all what make me the man i so proudly am
but i want to know one thing when did i become a ghost
im most confused about the world i live in
to think that im lonely well i probably am
one thing that still gets me
when did i become a ghost yeah
