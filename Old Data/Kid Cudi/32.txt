[intro]
and the story goes a young man will come and
save the universe from the forces of evil

[verse 1 kid cudi]
take a second to adjust to the ride
they say if this was a crime itd be federal
lately
ive been feelin invincible as im tryna find my way cant nothing hold me though
i say
get a clue
the vibes all around you
try but you cant deny when its in your soul
lets take it where there arnt any roads
where these sucka hatin niggas cant follow

[hook kid cudi]

take flight to the moon
come get in my space whip
to the satellite tonight

no worries
no worries

[verse 2 kid cudi]

i tell ya theres no way we could lose
have you ever seen the earth from this view

[hook kid cudi]

[verse 3 kid cudi]
and now the vibes
heavy little thoughts get jumbled in a bundle
and their tucked deep down in the back of my brain
heavy little thoughts get jumbled in a bundle
and their tucked deep down in the back of my brain
heavy little thoughts get jumbled in a bundle
and their tucked deep down in the back of my brain
all is life and all is pain
down the hallway of my endless fate

[hook kid cudi]
take it to the satellite tonight
take flight to the moon
come get in my space whip
to the satellite tonight
take flight to the moon
take a ride

take it to the satellite tonight
take flight to the moon
