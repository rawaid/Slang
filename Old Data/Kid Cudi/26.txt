aint no questionin aint no conspiracy
keep on searching for love who else is incomplete
theres so many good vibes just floating around in the world
and when the ground and sky combine im feeling more than fine
im so rock and rollin

dont you feel it feel it feel it
you know that im unfuckwittable
dont you feel it
you know that im unfuckwittable

one day i knew no one could help me in hell
not many people are true fake as the lies they tell
the world is filled with good vibes and that is what i seek
and now im feeling more than cool im feeling more than cool
them jokers cant help me

dont you feel it feel it feel it
you know that im unfuckwittable
dont you feel it
you know that im unfuckwittable

dont you feel it feel it feel it
you know that im unfuckwittable
dont you feel it
you know that im unfuckwittable
