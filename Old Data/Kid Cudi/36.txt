i am the maniac i am the fool
i found a monster in me when i lost my cool
it lives inside of me eating whats in its web
put black spray paint on my windows during the day
wanna spend time with it i think im losing it
or i found it and im using it
i wear my shades at night so i can look in the abyss
i see something in nothingness if you could picture this
put black holes in my jar lid
i climb the wall im too high and now id die from the fall
before the waters to our knees
we cant climb on the trees wash away
and you and i are the disease
