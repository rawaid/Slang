verse 1
i come from cleveland
yall can really hear it now
hit em like comic books
kaboom powpow
into a girls mind spitfineawinedine
i keep two phone sidekick for bad dimes
and a topical question is why im so chill
girls dont understand he aint even made a mill
they say im complex just like the magazine
i wear my closet complex like a magazine

i get in their head they dont even see my bread
oh so oh so fly cool as i wanna be one hell of a guy
i keep em short sweet thick and petite
ridin alongside in my cutlass supreme
im from a place where old schools are common
gotta explain everytime im rhymin i be

chorus
i be all day rollin in my whip got my sippin cup out on the low
i keep two pretty woman by my side im cooler than a polar bears toes
and i say
cleveland is that cleveland is the cleveland is the reason im cool
cleveland is that cleveland is the cleveland is the reason im leanin
cleveland is that cleveland is the cleveland is the reason im cool
cleveland is that cleveland is the cleveland is my my city

verse 2
yup yeppers smile all the time while
i chop it up like michael watts slow talk style
so the girlies can really catch all my accent
and the double o got her own accent
some niggas sell drugs to provide for they fam
some niggas sell cds up out they trunk man
some niggas they go to school for that higher learnin
i play the ojays while im turnin lanes


we be on our shift freakin black and milds still controllin the whip
aint no city like cleveland cruisin wit my bad bitch in the evenin
you wanna know exactly why im this way
take a trip to the land swing this way
after the song done aint much i can say
cleveland is my city city

chorus
i be all day rollin in my whip got my sippin cup out on the low
i keep two pretty woman by my side im cooler than a polar bears toes
and i say
cleveland is that cleveland is the cleveland is the reason im cool
cleveland is that cleveland is the cleveland is the reason im leanin
cleveland is that cleveland is the cleveland is the reason im cool
cleveland is that cleveland is the cleveland is my my city
