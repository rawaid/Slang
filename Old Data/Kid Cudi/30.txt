you see im trapped in my mind
and im going trippy
oh i dont think ill ever go

you see the walls are so high
that i couldnt climb them
so i dont know which way to roll

but im stuck in rewind

you see the sun seems to shine
when i am not looking
oh hes seen the trick every time

things do get out of hand
once in a while inside my mental
hey i took one hell of a run

when i see what is so
and no i am not lucky
yeah i like to pat my own back

its a gift and a curse since my birth
im in a prison
oh im happy right where im at

you see im trapped in my mind
and i know its crazy
hey its not that bad at all

when you think of the world
i know its crazy
hey im not that bad at all

im trapped in my mind
and i know its crazy
hey its not that bad at all

when you think of the world
i know its crazy
hey im not that bad at all
oh baby
