yeah yeah yeah

simple as that for your simple ass
ask about that pretty simple math
im dreaming on good for a sicker plan
sicker than any other nigga could be thinking than
i cant be a loser couldve figured that
i cant be a lame im cooler than that
i feel i love the fame then i hate it back
thinking now what i should be twitterin
whyd big bro took all the hot bitches
dear god me too i like the hot bitches
ill be the underdog all along till im gone
i will live through this song
ill be strong through the haters

as simple as that
as simple as that
as simple as that for your simple ass

as simple as that
as simple as 1 2 3

uh simple as that for your simple ass
simple way i wish you woulda called it how it shoulda been
they try to tell me they dont get it
they dont know the deal
now ill be damned i came this far to let a fool live
i gotta terminate the hate spread the positive
without it bein wack and cheesin to the little kids 
so i curse like a sailor and i smoke weed
i am exactly who in all the rappers kids be
and who they love
hands to the universe
pop between the drug addicts if they spit a cudi verse
mad little mama switch her converse out her purse 
long as the booty lookin juicy and hes stylin on her

as simple as that
as simple as that
as simple as that for your simple ass

as simple as that
as simple as 1 2 3
