oh
ohh ohh

[verse one]
what a world that im living in
will the rain storms ever end
still i feel my
path narrow i run again 
seem happiness is gone again
then you see em
grey clouds up above mane
metaphor to my life mane
still i feel my
heart stronger then its ever been
strong will till my journey ends
until then i roll
more than i ever rolled
not pills but the mary though
still i feel my
eyes heavy when the day go
nothing helping with my head dose
but i aint sleep
awake in another state
living in a new space
still i feel my
mind running at a steady pace
god help me so i win the race
until then i go

[chorus]
the sky might fall
the sky might fall
but im not worried at all
come on come on
the sky might fall
the sky might fall
but im not worried at all

[verse two]
grey clouds stuck together fam
lightning piercing through another land
over the desert where the lost play
soul searching each and every way
and then you see the
awesome sound so profound
when it- 
itll grip you
you can see it
if you hear it you can feel it too
something special i am running to
until then i go

away very far away
to another universe where all the people say
its the new new place 
for the special to embrace
like a martian who seemingly wandered out of place
take what you need from the valley of the hope
where even if you drowned youd be floating higher up
and you can say bye bye bye
sky might be falling but remember you can fly high

[chorus]
the sky might fall
the sky might fall
but im not worried at all
come on come on
the sky might fall
the sky might fall
but im not worried at all
