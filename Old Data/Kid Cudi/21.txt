narrator common 
long before we know ourselves our paths are already set in stone 
some may never figure out their purpose in life and some will 
there are alot of us who are caught up in this hell we all live in - 
content with being blinded by rules and judgement 
we live in a world where its more okay to follow than to lead 
in this world being a leader is being trouble for this system we are accustomed to 
being a leader in this day &amp; age is being a threat 
not many people stood up against the system we all call life 
but towards the end to the first ten years into the millenium we heard a voice 
a voice who were speaking to us from the underground for some time 
a voice who spoke of vulnerabilites and other human emotions and issues never heard so vividly and honest 
this is the story of a young man who not only believed in himself but his dreams too 
this is the story of the man on the moon
