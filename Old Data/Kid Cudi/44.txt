verse 1
little homie
in the room
in in the room
boy on the moon
had had no no one
no one to hangout with
talk that shit to
just my
little homies
one year younger
they aint get where i was going
took
a turn to the worst when my father left me lonely
mmmhmmmm
lonely in my room
i i me me
up on the moon
entertained myself
laughed at myself
as i grew to be a teen
i disguised myself had the
lowest self esteem
especially with the girls
tried every sport just to
impress all the girls
instead of all the ladies
cause they talked down
i was too artsy
known to be a clown
mmmmhmmmmm
hmph
and now my facebook poppin
cause i told the same girls ii would be the
hot shit
one day

hook
this will be my world
i told you so
this will be my world
i told you so
this will be my world
i told you so
this will be my world

verse 2
yeah

big homie
made the move
made made the move
flew off the moon
still had no no one
no one to hangout with
talk that shit 2
just my
brooklyn niggas
all i would wonder is
when will my time come
had mad jobs and i lost damn near all of them
thinking bout my bosses
yep i hated all of them
studio at night
had me hustling to most of them
nigga i was late
damn near everyday
but ima be on time when my stars align
when my soul was happy on my raman diet
followed by a loosie
was the meal of grinders
if you
knowing the truth
all you think about
is that thing
always be a hater tryna shoot down any dream
mmmhmmmmm
until you meet a kid like ki
niggaz thought i was crazy
my momma know i stay high
we gettin money mom

hook
this will be my world
i told you so
this will be my world
i told you so
this will be my world
i told you so
this will be my world

and none of yall had a clue about me
and none of yall had a clue about me
and none of yall really knew about me

i was heavy heavy heavy in my grizzle
and none of yall really cared about me
and none of yall really cared about me
now guess what
