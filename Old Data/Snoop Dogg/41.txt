[snoop talks over intro]
izzle kizzle fo schizzle
my nizzle what you sizzle

snoop dogg
me and my partner in my impala
poppin our collars tossin up dollars
a truck on the side of with hoes that wanna follow
bet a hundred dollars that they all wanna swallow
doggy doggfather
i do it to you real hard then it gets harder
its nada - thang on mine bang on mine
i smoke an ounce and bounce at the same time
its off the limbo with timbo you motherfuckin bimbo
so quit knockin at my window you nympho
maniac bring it back now shake it up
put it on the table now break it up
give it to me now put a lighter on the end of it
it really dont matter what you spent on it
as long as youre gettin what you paid for
thats what its made for aint that what you stayed for

chorus
whos that dippin in the cadillac
snoop dogg
smoke till your eyes get cataracts
snoop dogg
youve got a girl lay her on her back
snoop dogg
millionaire makin that paper stack
snoop dogg

snoop
you play me and ill play you
you pay me and ill pay you
hold on boo you got the game all wrong
this aint your thang this my song
move on we in the club at the shark bar
valet my keys and park my car
no snap shots cuz i might get popped
as i slide by security givin em props
first thing i do when i get in
let me take you back to when i first slid in
grab my gin and get my woman put my bib in no bullshittin
we be sippin in the corner
with smoke comin from up under us like we sittin in the sauna
burnin up the charts break a bitch off hard
little mama dont you start

snoop
tick tock the ice on my watch
slap me cross the face around 2 oclock
but the party dont stop till we blow up
now every little bitch wanna show up
manuevin to this groovin to this
dippin to this flippin to this trippin to this
aint no skippin to this trust this
bust this its too hot to touch this
he say she say i say no way
dont need foreplay ok obey
everything that i say
and every dayll be like a holiday
i put you in the front seat of my car
and roll you round town like a superstar
recline your seat and turn up the beat
number one with a bullet rollin down the mothafuckin backstreets

chorus x2
