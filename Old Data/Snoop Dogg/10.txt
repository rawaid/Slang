my mind starts trippin a tear drops my eye
my body temperature falls
im shakin and they breakin tryin to save the dogg
pumpin on my chest and im screamin
i stop breathin damn i see deamons
dear god i wonder can ya save me
i cant die boo-boos bout to have my baby
i think its too late for prayin hold up
a voice spoke to me and it slowly started sayin
bring your lifestyle to me ill make it better
how long will i live
eternal life and forever
and will i be the g that i was
ill make your life better than you can imagine or even dreamed of
so relax your soul let me take control
close your eyes my son
my eyes are closed


[chorus]

murder murder was the case that they gave me
murder murder was the case that they gave me

[verse two]

im fresh up out my coma
i got my momma and my daddy and my homies in my corner
its gonna take a miracle they say
for me to walk again and talk again but anyway
i get fronted some keys to get back on my feet
and everything that nigga said came to reality
livin like a baller loc
havin money and blowin hella chronic smoke
i bought my momma a benz and bought my boo-boo a jag
and now im rollin in a nine-trizzay el do-rad
just remember who changed your mind
cause when you start set-trippin that ass mine
indeed agreed proceed to smoke weed
never have a want never have a need
they say im greedy but i still want mo
cause my eyes wanna journey some more really doe check it out

now i lay me down to sleep
i pray the lord my soul to keep
if i should die before i wake
i pray the lord my soul to take

no more indo gin and juice
im on my way to chino rollin on the grey goose
shackled from head to toe
25 with an izzl with nowhere to gizzo i know
them niggaz from the other side recognize my face
cause its the og d-o-double-g l-b-c
mad doggin niggaz cause i dont care
red jumpsuit with two braids in my hair
niggaz stare as i enter the center
they send me to a leval 3 yard thats where i stay 
late night i hear toothbrushes scrapin on the floor
niggaz gettin they shanks just in case the war pops off
cause you cant tell whats next
my little homey baby boo took a pencil in his neck
and he probably wont make it to see twenty-two
i put that on my momma ima ride for you baby boo

[chorus 2x]
