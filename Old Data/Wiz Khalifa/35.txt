with the hunger of a chris wallace back in 94
i like to welcome yall to rock with pgs young ball
from the bottom of the pot yea im the pitts of the burgh
with the kids on the curb and small time is pitching the herb
im back and those who didnt previously know what im crack
to the people im legalized the lethal
we all got problems involving the rude of evil
but they caught me non-dodging long arming the people yup
and for the record i aint no half stepper
i rose from the city of steel the streets greedy for real

cats chasing their paper thats basic
mathematics hate to run the streets but took a staff at it
as i look back at hard it seems
i remember when this music thing was all but a dream
but im here for my city
and cant name no one thats near fucking with me
im bout to make history
