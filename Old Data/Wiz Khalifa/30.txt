[chorus wiz khalifa]
i had a dream that the whole world was staring at me
i woke up and wasnt no one there yeah eh eaah
same song to a different beat
cause sometimes i feels like im the only one there
i guess nobody cares hey
but everythings good until it goes bad
and your gonna tell all the people about the fun you used to have
it hurts when it dont last
no easy way saying bye
so im a spread my wings and head for the sky
and i fly solo
i fly solo
and i fly solo
and i fly solo
and i

[verse 1 wiz khalifa]
im tired of being tired
and dealing with your bs
all the while supplying
the money for your request
without me youre a dime
but with me youre a buck fifty haha
i can get another one quickly
but id rather wade it out
take the broken pieces try and fix it
or you could let your pride over weigh the right decision
and ill be in the sky you can pay your boy a visit
ha

[chorus wiz khalifa]

[verse 2 wiz khalifa]
remember what you said
but what you say to me aint guaranteed to always be the gospel
i was doing good way before i met you
now youre off the set
and im a let you see the show go on without you
take a bow think about it
and hopefully we could be friends but i really doubt it
see you be catching feelings now and i be catching planes
the story of my life youre just another page

[chorus 2]
but everythings good until it goes bad
and your gonna tell all the people about the fun you used to have
it hurts when it dont last
no easy way saying bye
so im a spread my wings and head for the sky
and i fly solo
i fly solo
and i fly solo
and i fly solo
and i

[outro]
i had a dream that the whole world was staring at me staring at me
i woke up and wasnt no one there no one there
yeah eh eaah
