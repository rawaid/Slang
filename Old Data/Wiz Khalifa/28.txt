[verse 1]
the world turning the weed burning
them haters talking i keep earning
know some will say that lifes a bitch
well ima flirtin and fuck that bitch for the money and louie v purchases
old folks jock my car cause they know just what this is
niggas felxin hard with no bars they got weak servants
keep verses mortal kombat
look at my ring if i aint ballin then what you call that
nothing but net aint back cause i never left
i did everything right nigga better yet
rolling bomb for the niggas thats around us
something like a contractor building from the ground up
now just
twist up this weed
realize that you are in the presence of a g
dont fuck up my paper meaning my cheese
or the ones i use to roll up my trees
fuck it you know what i mean

[chorus]
im riding round smoking good music so loud
kinda do my thing no disrespect to the niggas before me
some smile up in your face but then they dont on the low
now i just stunt on my own
now i just stunt on my own

im in a race and taking the winners place
no foot on the brakes
one the best homie thats what they call me
its lonely at the top got no company so
now i just stunt on my own
now i just stunt on my own

[verse 2]
see me when im alone wishing they could fuck with me
my ex calling my phone wishing she could stunt with me
but im just riding dog doing a buck fifty
stunting like jet li boat houses and jet skis
thirty on the flight ice like the gretskys
my dime piece only recognise the best trees
treat em like i dont need em boy you best believe
you in her face i let her breath

from debated on to waited on
from hated on to the nigga they put cake up on
cause we are young movie stars
cause we are young movie stars

[chorus]

ooooooh oooh ooo-oo-oooooh
ooooooh oooh ooo-oo-oooooh
ooooooh oooh ooo-oo-oooooh

[verse 3]
o-ooo-oh now i just stunt on my own
bitches aint say shit to me but now they wont leave me alone
used to walk the other way
but now they all come to my home
and they calling my phone cause my paper was looong
nothing they aint singing my song
get hired up if they want than i bring them along
we flying up now you want me to take it all off
want me to take it all off

tell a bitch ima ball and ima buy a new crib for my niggas n all
cause i remember days wed sit and picture it all
nigga swear id leave or pictured id fall
counting reasons why they hate your bitch think im a star
cause we are young gifted not to mention out here making muthafucking millions
yeah i said it muthafucking millions
got my money up im in the building

[chorus]
