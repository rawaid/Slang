[wiz khalifa - verse 1]
it’s the champagne pourin’
big joint rollin’
bombay sippin’
no blunt smoking
bad bitch gettin’
thick and she got some friends with her
i take ‘em out pourin’ shots of liquor
drinkin’ out the bottle smiling in all my pictures
the marijuana loud so them hoes follow like twitter
nigga you know everything taylored
don’t rush to the bar fool if you aint got no paper
that’s the rules high as fuck sloppy drunk when i’m passing through
rollin’ doobies up ya hoe who we pass ‘em to
hit the club spend this money up roll another one drink act a fool
thats what i have to do

[chorus]
see after drinking champagne all night
never worry `bout a damn thing y’all might
homie i’m on my level yeh
i’m on my level yeah
i’m on my level yeh
i’m on my level yeaah

so let me take one shot to the brain
and i order three more shots
i’m going in ayy
i’m on my level yeh
i’m on my level yeah
i’m on my level yeh
i’m on my level yeaah

[wiz khalifa - verse 2]
spent a couple dollars on my engine
motor roaring when i back out the garage
gin got me drunk as fuck stumbling out the bar
plus i’m struggling tryna find the keys to my car
cause i be going hard roll the camera
life just like a movie i’m the star
wish you was in my position
you too broke to play the part
of course i keep some bad women with me in the back
sippin’ rose with some hash twistin’
all about a dollar my team in the cash gettin’
straight out the burb we drinking we smash niggas
so when i say i’m balling that don’t mean that i’m playing mate
all my diamonds talkin’ you can see what they sayin’ mayne

[chorus]

[too $hort]
in the middle of the night early in the mornin’
from the streets to the sheets with some freaks i aint yawnin’
i’m wide awake we aint eatin’ we aint sleepin’
these bitches so high man we aint even speakin’
we just freakin’
you rollin’ with short dog baby
she was high on that pill so i fucked yo lady
come to my house i give ‘em everything they want
i might not dot it but i give to ya women
cocaine mushrooms ecstasy ghb marijuana
she can suck it if she wanna
i got tequila ciroc and two freaky friends
and this a wednesday night this aint the weekend

[chorus]

[bridge]
man i’m high as fuck
man i swear i’m on my level
man i’m sloppy drunk
man i swear im on my level
i finna pass out

i finna pass out
