ohh long days but i know hard work pays
so all the money getting long to
and the kush smell strong too
thats that good any chick with me need a bong too
one thing i know is go hard young make fake niggas know this
blowing money cause you die if you dont live
thats how you know i was fly when i wrote this

used to say that i was trippin so a nigga bought expensive ass bags

[chorus]
get on straight never switch lane on my job every day cause its hard not to see

let you dance what you want hear me wax hear me walk let go hell no
let you lean back inhale smoke

[2x chorus]
get on straight never switch lane on my job every day cause its hard not to see
i came up in a big way and i hardly ever sleep well its like a dream
