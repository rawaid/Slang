[chorus]
started out slow
cause no matter how much she gets she wants more
girl now we on the top floor
holding on tight you and i go
can you feel it in
can you feel it in
feel it in

[verse 1]
uh first class help you in the game like a free throw
fill my bank up with cash my glass with clicquot
you aint gotta tell your friends what we talk about or the places that we go
you mine for the night your man tryin repo uh
work nights never sleep so you think she got no job
go to school during the week on the weekend we go hard
live so large let you go tear down the mall like its your car
its no problem go ahead and sing it girl this is your song

[chorus]
started out slow
cause no matter how much she gets she wants more
girl now we on the top floor
holding on tight you and i go
can you feel it in
can you feel it in
feel it in

[verse 2]
oh nothing you could tell us they get jealous when we show up
make you feel like a little girl again or fuck you like a grown-up
high as you can be its like the dream you never woke from
my lifes like a movie get ready for your close up
pour bottle and toast up your man in your phone tryna to see what your plans is
so what you still turn up my songs soon as they playing it
know what the sayin is money talks and you aint saying shit
imma call you soon as i land
probably roll some weed right up on the beach while you tan
party every week and you hardly would speak
but now you got my phone taking pictures laughing smoking chilling yeah

[chorus]
started out slow
cause no matter how much she gets she wants more
girl now we on the top floor
holding on tight you and i go
can you feel it in
can you feel it in
feel it in

we dont need to worry talk probably cause we in the sky sky sky sky
when we really take off and i tell her hold on cause she say she never been this high
we dont need to worry talk probably cause we in the sky sky sky sky
when we really take off and i tell her hold on cause she say she never been this high
