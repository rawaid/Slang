and run away to the runway
to find somewhere to lay my heartlay my heart
if you see me rollin’ that’s where i’m going
to find somewhere to lay my heart
home’s wherever i lay my heart

verse  iggy azalea
you ever start to feel that home wasn’t your home
kinda like somebody made you wear the wrong clothes
what you say ain’t gotta be what you made of
well see your heart don’t always match where you came from
couldn’t see you so they treat you like a misfit
because your mind clicks in another district
call you favor they don’t know what’s inside you
‘cause what’s inside justifies what divides you
searching for that place right where you wanna be
that’s really real where it’s never full capacity
roll back and get away never come back never runaway

chorus
put everything in a suitcase one day
and run away to the runway
to find somewhere to lay my heart
home’s wherever i lay my heart
if you see me rollin’ that’s where i’m going
to find somewhere to lay my heart
home’s wherever i lay my heart

verse  pusha t
they say home’s where you hang your hat
so beware of the owner ’cause he bang his gap
and in that shit i push and i clean my set
all over the globe via i rap
and it still ain’t enough for the haters
put on for my city light it up like it’s vegas
how you frontin’ on i lead i’m the greatest
flow like a butterfly  the porsche ride amazing
i feel like speedracer
my jello’s in the louie duffle
mcm hold the finna’ buckle
paw that’s what i call an interracial couple
a long whip poppin’ tans that’s a power struggle

chorus
put everything in a suitcase one day
and run away to the runway

if you see me rollin’ that’s where i’m going
to find somewhere to lay my heart
home’s wherever i lay my heart

verse  iggy azalea
change my lounge too and my lattitude
to get an attitude the shit granted too

this is the line and i walk alonei remember when it used to be simple
but all this cash it just complicates things
and all this money we into
it will drive you crazy but it only makes me go harder
grow stronger and get tougher when the road get longer
sometimes you gonna think that its too much on ya
but think what id be doing if this wasnt going on
so i just keep pushing when im being pulled in every direction
now im popping so the they watching every step of my progression
sometimes fame like a curse latched to my blessing
on the road to the riches turning earth into heaven

this twisted cat and mouse game always starts the same
first were both down to play then somehow you go astray
we went from nothing to something liking to loving
it was us against the world and now were just fucking
its like i loved you so much and now i just hate you
feeling stupid for all the time that i gave you
i wanted all or nothing for us aint no place in between
by me believing what you say that you never mean
like itll last forever but now forever aint as long
if it wasnt for you i wouldnt be stuck singing this song
you were different from my last but now you got a mirror
but as it all plays out i see it couldnt be clearer now sing

i shoulda known you were bad news
from the bad boy demeanor and the tattoos
cause most guys only want one thing
but im undecided tryna figure out if thats you
either way though i think youre worth a test drive
cause ooh youre so much better than the next guy
and a little trouble only makes for a good time
so all the normal red flags be a good sign

don’t you come here thinking you’re ballin
aint down for it
you seem like trouble to me
i can tell by the way that you lean
and the way that you kiss your teeth
and you turn up so fresh and clean
smells like trouble to me

opposites attract i guess this it that
good girl bad guy what a perfect match
and if we ooo youre gon want to pay back tithes
cause when you finish you gon feel like you was baptized
see baby now you fiendin for a test drive
cause you dont wanna lose your ride to the next guy
and baby trouble only makes for a good time
so all the normal red flags be a good sign

don’t you come here thinking you’re ballin
aint down for it
you seem like trouble to me
i can tell by the way that you lean
and the way that you kiss your teeth
and you turn up so fresh and clean
smells like trouble to me

i got it bad for him in the worst way
dear lord howd i get in this position and
i shoulda have never got involved in the first place
but second place never get the recognition hmm
see what he doin to me make have to shout it out
got a hold on me thats without a doubt
so clear now that hes a trouble starter
but i aint a saint neither and these aint no still waters hmm

just cause all the girls are falling at your feet
dont mean no thing to me
till you show me where its at
smells like trouble to me

just cause all the girls are falling at your feet
dont mean no thing to me
till you show me where its at
smells like trouble to me

i shoulda known you were bad news oo oo oo knew you were bad news
from the bad boy demeanor and the tattoos oo oo oo all of the tattoos
i shoulda known you were bad news oo oo oo knew you were bad news
but im undecided tryna figure out if thats you oo oo oo trouble to me

don’t you come here thinking you’re ballin
aint down for it
you seem like trouble to me
i can tell by the way that you lean
and the way that you kiss your teeth
and you turn up so fresh and clean
smells like trouble to mei remember when it used to be simple
but all this cash it just complicates things
and all this money we into
it will drive you crazy but it only makes me go harder
grow stronger and get tougher when the road get longer
sometimes you gonna think that its too much on ya
but think what id be doing if this wasnt going on
so i just keep pushing when im being pulled in every direction
now im popping so the they watching every step of my progression
sometimes fame like a curse latched to my blessing
on the road to the riches turning earth into heaven
dear lord if you hear me i dont need not a new friend near me
cause i dont want none of that fake love
cause im looking and all of that be made up

i remember when i wasnt this big
and now yall wanna act like yall helped me get here
oh now everybody wanna love me
try to knock me down but im strong
i did all this on my own
aint got no time for no new friends
so for now just leave me alone

i dont need yall anyway
i dont need yall anyway
i dont need yall anyway
i dont need yall anyway
i dont need yall anyway
i dont need yall anyway
i dont need yall

making each and every song like it might be my last one
but still making sure the cash come
still aint forget the times when i didnt have none
back against the wall feeling like i had to grab some
thats when i took time and i figured it out
id rather deal with the stress more than living without
take a one way trip to the top one time
let you have it for a minute now i want mine
same girl on the cover of the magazine
was the one hiding pain that you havent seen
talking bout
no money no family
sixteen in the middle of miami
same critics love me nowadays couldnt stand me
now we talking bout vmas and a grammy
but in due time turn nothing into something
so now i need money put it all in my discussions

i remember when i wasnt this big
and now yall wanna act like yall helped me get here
oh now everybody wanna love me
try to knock me down but im strong
i did all this on my own
aint got no time for no new friends
so for now just leave me alone

and if you wasnt here when i was down
then you wont be here when im up
now the same one you looked over
be the same one that blew up
aint it funny how this life thing works
when you think its finished is when it all begins
go from doubts to having the thought it might work
it goes up and down then it starts again
when i reminisce sometimes i cant even keep a dry eye
but my how time flies by when you on top of the world sky high

i remember when i wasnt this big
and now yall wanna act like yall helped me get here
oh now everybody wanna love me
try to knock me down but im strong
i did all this on my own
aint got no time for no new friends
so for now just leave me aloneyou used to be everything now that mean nothing
thought this was poker with the cards up but we were bluffing
i miss you but pride wont let me tell you
thought that we had all the time
but im guessing that plans fell through
yeah we fell off
i wont ask you to climb back
i paid twenty for that rolly i just want my time back
was wrong too but i see it now
that you dont give a damn
i got you tatted you took off before the ink dried on my hands
i was down to give you the world instead you gave me hell
i lied tried to be perfect and i played myself
and it hurts so bad we coulda worked on that
cause you say you love me but real love dont work like that
the truth is i left a piece of me in a piece i gave you
and i tend to laugh and crack a smile when things get painful
said i crack a smile when things get painful
remembering the moments when i used to date you

rolexs dont tick-tock
but damn it baby my time costs
and damn it baby my time is money
so i need payback for all the time lost
i need payback for all the time lost
said i need payback for all the time lost
damn it baby my time costs
so i need payback for all the time lost

say that you love me
i say that youre lying
cause i said we could work on it you said lets leave it behind
couldnt put together the picture i paint in my mind
so how i see you know insulting me is wasting my time
but we live and learn and learn and love and let go
cause if we stay in this then we might make it worse than before
another hard lesson stressing taking personal notes
remember sweet nothings like baby whats the purpose in those
both of us saying it shouldnt have went like that
but sometimes in love it just get like that
used to think that when it went wrong wed get right back
you know cupids got another arrow and shit like that
and for all of yall watching i hope that this entertain you
and that you enjoyed this song that i sang you
cause im still here laughing when it gets painful
remembering the moments when i used to date you

rolexs dont tick-tock
but damn it baby my time costs
and damn it baby my time is money
so i need payback for all the time lost
i need payback for all the time lost
said i need payback for all the time lost
damn it baby my time costs
so i need payback for all the time lost

rolexs dont tick-tock
but damn it baby my time costs
and damn it baby my time is money
