im telling you 89 is mine peaceguru
the music started in the hearts and drums from another land
played for everyone by sons of the motherland
sendin out a message of peace to everybody and
came across the oceans in chains and shame
easing the pain and it was without name
until some men in new orleans on rampart street
put out the sounds and then they gave it a beat
im talkin bout jelly roll king and satch
im talkin bout the music that had no match
yes the music and it was born down there
were gonna use it so make the horn sound clear
its jazz music jazz music

yo the music that pops and other cats made
it stayed cause people love when they played
to the north it took a riverboat shuffle
to the big cities with lots of hustle and bustle
to chicago and to the apple too
this was a scene that our forefathers knew
go get your crew i know theyll get into
the jazz music jazz music

the music called jazz had the razzamatazz
it had the flavor and a lot of pizazz
the big band beat was very neat and unique
the swing was king it made you tap your feet
there was benny and duke and of course the count basie
the melody was smooth and yes very taste
there was hap the prez and lady day and
dizzy bird and miles they were all playin
they brought it to the people of the foreign lands
back across the oceans and the desert sands
where it echoes in the distant sounds of drums
and it rises with the sun on days begun
this is the music that we give tribute to
they gave it to us thats why we give it to you
the jazz music the jazz music

you aint livin right punk ill have to school you
not rule you but ill say yo you fool yourself
when you try to deny and defy written laws
this means your cause has lost
think about it take the time and even ponder longer
then let your mind start to wander
go black and track the facts about all of your mistakes
it only takes to one to make fate
pick up your life clean up your act and get a legal plan
you can or be an evil man
caught and then you claim youre not responsible
the choice was yours when the funs gone you will realize
that you dont get somethin for nothin why you bluffin
others even brothers are stuffin their pockets
with honest cash theyll laugh so dont knock it
jock it cause the guru must stop it
ill jab you smack you crack -- youre demolished
you must acknowledge -- life is like a college in itself
get a degree in reality
or you will be upon it like a lawn youll be walked on
gone never to see or be the same again
friend cause the time you spend
bringin down yourself bringin down the pace
bringin down your friends bringin down the race
will have your life in a wreck
and homeboy life is cause and effect

* primo scratches *

guru
exactly what you put in boy you will get out of it
the energy released comes back there is no doubt of it
so when you thrive to connive and contrive foolish deeds
this means youll bleed from greed
dig the rhyme dig the thought of whatll happen
youre nappin youre gonna fall off the map n
lie out and cry out why  you got the short end of the stick
cause youre too quick to run tricks
open your mind widen your sight get out of your rut
move and get the lead out of your butt
cause you cant live without a plan to get freshed chump
and you shouldnt stand to let
anything sway you from the path you know is truthful
chill cause you know the chosen youth will
take over and control the whole so dont blow it
know it cause the guru must show it
ill teach you reachin each so youre enlightened
emcees are frightened by what i write in my songs
cause i express what i manifest
while some of you fall down to the ground with breakdowns
never to see or be the same again
friend cause the time you spend
bringin down yourself bringin down the pace
bringin down your friends bringin down the race
will have your life in a wreck
and homeboy life is cause and effect

guru
youre still playin games lame ill have to end you
straight to the gate of fate so you can claim your doom
will you decay as you pay in repentance

but if you dont you will be finished
youll dissapear you will diminish
never to see or be the same again
friend cause the time you spend
bringin down yourself bringin down the pace
bringin down your friends bringin down the race
will leave you bugged and upset
cause homeboy life is cause and effect

chumps tryin me but when they eyein me
i build in skills and to enhance my chances
im thrilled to be involved with solvin
all the problems with the way that the sound
has gone down so i frown at the scene
where you be takin it and like the winds of change
ill be breakin it up shakin it up
clearing it out airing it out and bearing the clout
on my chest like a crest that rests
on a tidal wave only the good ill save
when i plunge and engulf the ones
who arent sons who converse with  and make friends
yo i recommend that you get back there
and sit back there contemplate calculate
and concentrate on these rhymes that i picked to stick
to your mind and then ill raise you straight
to the next phase cause i will amaze
with much force and like the power that comes
from the source which is greater and stronger of course
if you didnt know i will tell you
that all the blind no-minds i give hell to
and if you comprehend what is said
then youll be stayin two steps ahead

one two steps ahead

i cant work with those jerks who front
with the mic cause i never liked fabrications
wack creations that lack authenticity
for some time in my mind ive been wishin the
fiends who do would just yield
and at the foot of my bed i have kneeled
thus revealed as a gift i have nurtured
and i hurt ya if youre not knowin
that the musical need is now growin
and like a man obsessed i must
go all out show all out blow all out
throw all out get on out of my path
cause i laugh at the ones with no gas
i surpass the class to get geesed
like the way the ballistics released
and i wont cease til i cap them
or slap the saps with my rappin
continue on with my journey
all the negative ones dont concern me
my eyes are wise i got cause to live
positive have to give every way
every day of my life so i fight for the right
and get hype so heed what i feed
and get fed then youll be livin two steps ahead

guru
im way ahead of you yes im on top
its me instead of you with the lyrics you fear it
so get near it and then youll hear it clear
and concise cause i paid the price to be
talking here rocking there shocking here
stop and stare then compare if you wish
because the others fess i insist
so i will assist you to blend with this
bend with this tend with this fend with this
as i ascend with my orals
you define and defy with high morals
and at the spot i will stop to throw darts
at the ones who proclaim with no aim
cause they dont hold the fame theyre on mine
and since im well inclined and divine
i will have to ask you to come in
move along with the tongue and the drummin
progress and let the blessings be read
and youll be staying two steps ahead

one two steps ahead
one two steps ahead

one two * cut and scratched by premier *punks will always scheme to create a means
to take my kindness for weakness cause they dont seem to

they push up to get up close to serve me puddin
and i just tell em look here i am not a crook there
but i like to snatch em all cause like a hook theyre stuck
struck they tried to press their luck
they wanna tease me and skeeze me and please me to squeeze the bucks

once you step in the arena cheater; youre gonna be a-
mazed when you gaze at the armor on this leader
fully clad and glad to find a cause i wont pause
fear is a joke slowpoke im like claws
thatll rip cause your gift is merely flesh
superficial and i wish you would give it a rest
but if you dont ill unsheath my excalibur
like a noble knight so meet ya challenger
a true hero while youre a through zero
gettin beat to a pulp so that you cant run for help
i heard a gulp in your throat cause you hope that ill be merciful
but coo-cluck i made you strut as i rehearse a few
battle drills and watch your bladder spill
yellow fluid check out how i mellowed into it
face to feet to defeat you can tell im into it
as im pullin out my lance to kill you and advance to
the winners throne; cause i own you once you step in the arena

{dj premier cuts the phrase step up over and over}

guru
in the arena or rather colliseum
theres people gatherin by multitudes to see one
perpretrator fall to the dust after the other
quickly disposed of at the hand of a known brother
born wit the art in his heart that is spartacus
and one-to-one combat jack just a thought of this
match-up makes gangstarr wanna snatch up
one or two phrases from the new book with new pages
of rhymes that are built like a chariot
dope vocals carry it to the battle set
if a beat was a princess i would marry it
but now i must bow to the crowd as i stand proud
victorius glorious understand now
cause battles and wars and much fights i have been through
one mc got beheaded and you can too
forget it cause youd rather be just a spectator
an onlooker afraid you may get slayed or
struck by a blow from a mic gladiator
i betcha that later you might be sad that you played yourself
cause you stepped up chest puffed out
and in just one lyric you got snuffed out

knowledge is power and knowledge can be the difference between life
or deathyou should know the truth and the truth shall set you
free

[verse 1]

i was raised like a muslim
prayin to the east
nature of my life relates rhymes i release
like a cannon
cuz i been plannin to be rammin what i wrote
straight on a plate down your throat
so digest as i suggest we take a good look
at whos who while im readin from my good book
and lets dig into every nook and every cranny
set your mind free as i slam these thoughts
and just like a jammy goes pow [fx gunshots]
youre gonna see what im sayin now
you cant be sleepin
cuz things are gettin crazy
you better stop being lazy
theres many people frontin
and many brothers droppin
all because of dumb things let me tell you somethin
ive been through so much that im such
a maniac but i still act out of faith
that we can get the shit together so i break
on fools with no rhymes skills messin up the flow
and people with no sense who be movin much too slow
and so you will know the meaning of the gang starr
guru with the mic and premier raise the anchor
swiftly as we embark on a journey
i had to get an attorney
i needed someone to defend my position
decisions i made cuz now its time to get paid
and ladies these rhymes are like the keys to a dope car
maybe a lexus or a jaguar
still all of that is just material
so wont you dig the scenario
and just imagine if each one is teachin one
well come together so that we become
a strong force then we can stay on course
find your direction through introspection
and for my people out there i got a question
can we be the sole controllers of our fate
now whos gonna take the weight

[verse 2]

the weight of the world is heavy on my mind
so as my feelings unwind i find
that some try to be down just cuz its trendy
others fall victim to envy
but ill take the road less travelled
so i can see all my hopes and my dreams unravel
relievin your stress expressin my interest
in the situation that youre facin
thats why im down with the nation
spirituality supports reality
we gotta fight with the right mentality
so we can gain what is rightfully ours
this is the meaning of the chain and the star
land is power so gimme forty acres
lets see how far i can take ya
original invincible
thats how im lookin at it
i use my rhymes like a glock automatic
any means necessary im goin all out
before the rains bring the nuclear fallout
so let me ask you is it too late
ayo whos gonna take the weightexpanding the depth of your brainpower
ours is a better gift not to be bragging nor lolligagging
i can see dimensions of sound and light around my mic
transmitting lyrics like teletype
reacting to a beat in a whisper
and like a transistor im sounding dope when im crisper
the shortest length between two points is a straight line
ive gotta take mine i heard it through the grapevine
that some cant find hype lines hype lines
and so im smothering over my prey i am hovering
suckers im shoving at the same time covering
you with the blanket of some language thats distinguished
how swift can i get  you ask and ill tell
for i can excel real well like a gazelle
past your head im grabbin abstract thought
like some gain glory while others get no part
i feel for the hurt ones the victims of wrong deeds
awareness is key our people have strong needs
science math history theology
philosophy psychology english and biology
et cetera and all of these have a purpose
but genocide makes me nervous
so many questions many opinions to mention
and damn damn this jams beyond comprehension

like planets in orbit we ride the life cycle
some take a rifle on the street cause it seems neat
whatever turns you on i guess thats why vests are in season
ill do my show then im leavin
id rather be blastin dope sounds on the other side of town
than be there when they close the place down
but anyway everyday theres another way
for a person to just flip so a brother may
simply go buckwild get crazy and mad
i know the struggle my father had
poetry it comes from within and will always win
hold captive bodies from end to end
and at a party ill survey then slay with the quickness
displaying the fitness
easing the mind and relieving the tension
and singing my own song thats beyond comprehensionguru
you puny protozoa youre so minute you didnt know the
gang has been watchin but instead of just squashin you
im scoopin you up out of the muck you wallow in
like a cheif chemist other scientists are followin
plannin to examine you on a petrie dish
sticking you and frickin you just a teenie bit
im clever with science but never relyin
on false words from cowards who forever be tryin
insistin they come off i let em get some off
then come back wit drum tracks their ears could get numb off
blockbustin like makin love ill never stop thrustin
into your system so just listen
im like a neurosurgeon operatin wit a purer version
i write prescriptions of words that fit in
the thought gets prescribed as i kick it live
cause its more that a style its conceptual genius
my effect on the scene is to project that i mean this
you deadbeat wait until you see my next feat
i get respect for the rep when i speak

and yo her style is worthwhile
and knowing that im deep like a river i feel i should give her
things that those others cant deliver
contrary to what i had wished it seems that ive been dissed
but hey i dont want to miss this
wonderful opportunity my boys they try schoolin me 
but see i know what i want
someone wholl be there for the whole nine this honey is so fine 
but now shes hung up the line
upset because i told her im busy she made like a grizzly
and started chewin my head off
screamin that i spend more time with friends
and also she said i ruined her weekend
i said i know the stuff we had planned but please understand
right now im loungin with my man
i guess i didnt realize id hurt her she said i had the nerve to
just neglect her like that
then she started bringing up past things and she kept asking
how come our love isnt lasting
i said hey baby please calm down cuz im still around
and its for you that my heart pounds
can i call you later on you say i treat you wrong
but why you flippin on me
she said something else and then click
left me alone on the phone with the tone
and now im lovesick

relationships can grip with the pain
arguments in the crib in the streets on the train
im crazy fed but then still
when she aint there i feel sad i feel ill
frowning cuz im down in the dumps
the other night i took her out so she could shake her rump
but after we were there for a few
some girls that i knew stepped up and asked me to come to
a party they were havin at their house
i looked at my girl and yo she started walkin out
i said hey love just wait for a second
and wont you just check it its all a part of makin records
those were just some friends in the business
no need to get angry so listen up while i kick this
and what about the things we discussed
about havin trust whats all this attitude stuff
now hon you know that i wouldnt play you
but time after time you let your jealousy sway you
hey dont you turn your back like that
come on this is wack youre heated up like a thermostat
then she stepped off in a whirlwind and i dont know when
or if im gonna see her again
i coulda sworn she was the right one to pick
but nowman im just lovesickmany mcs are mislead
mislead by the lies that they pump in their heads
the money and the fame that theyre hoping to find
will never come close to the scope of my rhyme
now some have been succesful but really
and yo these mcs are clearly not nearly
up to this level or should i say caliber
because im hype that the companys selling me
because theyll take a dud talk some crud and then push him
but in the next year someone new will just squoosh him
because when you sell out to appeal to the masses
you have to go back and enroll in some classes
so cash in your check cause its the last one you get
the tables have turn and now you aint in effect
so jet to the rear and you better just follow
cause whats here today maybe gone tomorrow

here and gone in a flash some made cash
while other suckers go broke real fast
some never make any money but still they act funny
like theyre thinking theyre running
things wearing rings and medallions
then listen to their rhymes when we rather take valiums
cause swiftness and skills they are lacking
so i send them packing they should have know not to tax in
and smashing all of the vocals to smithereens
watching them collecting themselves cause they bitter seen
but some find happiness while others find sorrow
and whats here today maybe gone tomorrow<span style=padding1em><img alt=trebleclef class= data-image-key=trebleclefpng data-image-name=trebleclefpng height=68 src=http//vignette2wikianocookienet/lyricwiki/images/1/1e/trebleclefpng/revision/latest/scale-to-width/30cb=20090423154754 width=30/></span> instrumentalnow what you hear is not a test --&gt; sugarhill gang

well goodness gracious let me just take this
time out to pull a rhyme out and update this
for you and yours simply because
some mcs have luck but suck
so i pluck em like feathers on the back of a chicken
cause im mad like a pit when my man says sick em
positive is the mindstate but it could still mean that
i will kick a ill malicious like mean rap
suckers they forced me to knock em all out and
they think they know things like what im about and
they try to analyze criticize scandalize
the outcome is death dont ask me to sympathize
realize that im not to be played with
ill flip so fast you wont know im the same kid
im tired and fed with all the weak stuff said
all the phony-baloney that went out like pro-keds
youve got no leads so you shoot blanks
its me the crowd thanks as i step to the top ranks
bankin my money and investin it wisely
snatchin up chumps when they try to sneak by me
im the dominant one call me the prominant one
and as im speakin ill be bombin the dumb
deaf and blind cause i was born with a sharp mind
eatin mcs with ease like its lunchtime
or crunchtime when they get done without warning
ill bust that butt from nighttime til morning
your songs boring and so im scoring
much points cause when its time to throw joints
i cause havoc the mic i grab is like savage
i invade the stage and make you get off
the force is like a three-eight blowin your head off

dont ever sleep son peep one or two of these lines here
arranged by a great brain delivering rhymes clear
and concise with a nice dope voice and
killin the fakes like a taste of some poison
punks are thinkin theyre alla that their voices are all flat
theyre findin their names in a wack rappers almanac
me follow that hollow crap no way jose
ill seek out a better sound to somethin premier plays
days will go by and soon youll know why
mcs like me will rise like the enterprise
starship headin straight for the target
destination a place where no perpetration
is permitted the guru is with it to explain
how some mcs are scared to ride on a four train
or any other train in the city for that matter
playin a role that they stole like a batter
but i know they aint so ill paint the real picture
my vocals go solo and like a bolo ill hitcha
square in your face ill crack your ribs and your chest
cause you thought your off-brand jam was the best
you fessed cause you guessed people would be impressed
im gonna bust that bubble on the double take a rest

dj premier cuts take a rest for the chorus

guru
sit back and reflect ponder and chill out
rhymes like daggers make blood spill out
but you cant blame me for bringin disaster
with all these ducks claimin that theyre the masters
only thing they mastered is how to get wacker
as i roll uphill they roll downhill faster
now theyre wondering how they lost their touch
wanna buy my rhymes but mine cost too much
im the innovative one call me the creative one
and i wont stop til the job is done
all the slobs just run when i come to get some
cause they know better than to challenge this go-getter
they get bust you can trust cause i wont let a
booty-ass rapper get wins against me
i guarantee that i wont act friendly
cause crabs have a nerve and deserve to get whipped on
their girls get kissed on while they get flipped on
i slaughter and slay or slap em up quick
cause the lyrics they kick make me seriously sick
no substance no value but nevertheless
theyre gettin daytime play but i still say they should take a rest

dj premier cuts take a rest for four bars then song fadespresenting you with alternative music
cause yo the struggle is tough and we must learn to live through it
pleasure and pain pain and pleasure
we gotta maintain a balance to obtain the treasure
not really preaching or teaching but just reaching
out to a brother or sister who is keeping
the faith and trying hard to get straight
the time is crucial so i think we must congregate
lets have a meeting of the minds
before we all fall and get left far behind
finding a way is important
map out a plan take a stand you can work it
the futures all in your hands and
so of yourself yea you should be demanding
were all responsible for whatever outcome
thats why i speak over beats for my income
knowledge is key and if you ask what it is g
its just a form of my style of street ministry
street ministrystick up kids is out to tax x2
and this is how the story goes

brothers are amused by others brothers reps
but the thing they know best is where the gun is kept
cause in the night youll feel fright
and at the sight of a 4-5th i guess you just might
wanna do a da or two
cause they could maybe bust you for self or wit a crew
no matter is you or your brothers a star
he could pop you in and jet without a getaway car
and some might say that hes a dummy
but hes sticking you and taking all of your money
its a daily operation
he might be loose in the park or lurking at the train station
mad brothers know his name
so he thinks he got a little fame
from the stick-up game
and while were blaming society
hes at a party with his man
they got their eye on the gold chain
that the next mans wearing
it looks big but they aint staring
just thinking of a way and when to get the brother
theyll be long gone before the kid recovers
and back around the way hell have the chain on his neck
claimin respect just to get a rep

ten brothers in a circle
had the kid trapped the one wit the hood he said well hurt you
if you dont run out your dues and pay
give up the rolex watch or you wont see another day
see they were on the attack
and one said yo you wanna make this to a homicide rap
make it fast so we can be on our way
kick in the rings and everything ok
the kid was nervous and flinching
and little shorty with the 3-8 yo he was inchin
closer and closer put the gun to his head
shorty was down to catch a body instead
money was scared so he panicked
took off his link and his rings and ran frantic 
but shorty said now pulled the trigger and stepped
it was nothing he did it just to get a rep

the rep goes bigger and now hes known for his trigger finger
rolling with troops of the sons like a gangster figure
hes near the peak of his crazy career
his posses a nightmare macking jewls and some crazy gear
but as we know these things do come back
and shortys now peeping others that are scheming the kind of act
cuz the kid that got shot didnt perish so
he pulls up in a jeep with tinted window
too late shorty was caught in the mix
his time ran out his number came up and thats it
ya know the rest so dont front the plan has been upset
some brothers gotta go out just to get a repso many things will happen that one cant explain
you find yourself saying who me time and again
they say what goes around comes around
ahun so think about it while youre messing up clown
a mothers love and a fathers concern
here is the reason you should listen and learn
cause quick schemes and fast living can kill ya
i know how the excitement and danger can thrill ya
but take it from somebody who knows
cause after all the highs youre gonna feel all the lows
this is why knowledge of self is essential
cause if you dont have it you may simply go mental
see life is not a thing to be toyed wit
cause every second another dream is destroyed wit
the systematic plan devised to erase us
and straight to hell is where theyre trying to take us
but never fold and hold back your fears
have a strong mind and try to say your prayersdj premier scratches at this time i have the honor to present to you

guru

other writers are outclassed
surpassed by the words and the wit
rhymes fit and hit cause thats how we designed it
page for page we are the new age
dope in the videos and dope when were on stage
commanding respect with my ink pen while suckers are sinking
as im keeping them thinking
narrating phrases of value and i can see now you

the guru will tell em why their records aint sellin
placin my fingers on the tool i runaway all fools
when im dispersin a verse
think of an enjoyable moment then boogie your body
cause this party i own it
the origin of this is on paper
vibes will ascend from my mind to each line
i go with the flow as i show expertise
the powers increase as my voice hits the streets
then gripping your soul with authority
i pour these rhymes in a cup so drink up
and then i might bring another round
watch the sound pound from the floor to the ground
and keep aware cause well show you the best way
and then sway as i read my s-aguru

vocal inflection connects its a slugfest
ladies approach to hear quotes from the spokesman

premier cuts and scratches to kick the right rhyme

guru
listen listen listen ill tell ya
my rhymes are like shelter or rather like an umbrella
protecting you from the weak stuff you heard from those creampuffs
about the schemes that they dreamed of
about the way they slayed this one or that one
but wont step to me cause they know the last one
who tried to match the panache of the guru
received a curse that was much worse than voodoo
cause the effect of my voice is immense
it would make more sense if suckers hide in the basement
but yo i dont look for hassles my rhymes are like castles
i got much flavor and class too
i know youve notice im a writer of hype lines
because im inclined to kick precisely the right rhymes

premier cuts and scratches to kick the right rhyme

guru

with power and punch and yo you might want to step back
but stay close as your host serves hors doeveurs
satisfying your cravings and calming your nerves
see i have an interest in giving you more than the next man
cause my style is pure and
if you are sane and remain in your right mind
youll see im inclined to kick precisely the right rhymes

premier cuts and scratches to kick the right rhymethe meaning of the name gangstarr well ill tell ya
it means i find my mind can excel to
a greater type of thought brought by the things that ive been taught
in relation to things that i rebel to divine and combine
with a sense of confidence
accomplishments are achieved off lots of gifts
but slopiness i could never tolerate it
not the guru nor premier you dont know how long weve waited
while other groups have faded just like haircuts
we use sheer guts to open the earducts of your brain
to expose every vain
cause you sound plain insane and mundane its a shame
youve got no beats so you get no seats
at this table you aint stable with the mic cable
kane and able jealous brothers
and i knew some girls who were overzealous lovers
but back to the act of developing the gangstarr track
it means that nothing can be wack
the music is picked right the mic is gripped tight
the lyrics i kick right to a beat like kryptonite power
not withstood by any mortal or immortal
to make you get on the floor til
another dope jam we slam with precision
bringing beams of light like the colors in a prism
or reflections through a spectrum
and all the soft silly suckers ima wet them
in other words destroy boy and then claim my fame
this is the meaning of the name

dj premier cuts what does it all mean

guru
gangstarr it means a lot to me
it means im free to bust rhymes sporadically
gang represents my boys or a posse
so just back up off me
and the starr symbolizes the power
making the suckers and weak brothers cower
we got strong intelligent minds with a street sense
crazy offense and stupid defense
now have i made myself clear
or do i have to call on dj premier
for he and i make up the songs that you long for
meanwhile ducks just knock on the wrong door
waiting for a call or for the doors to open
cause theyre hoping that theyll get chosen
but to be chosen is a divine gift
you better get a job quick
see you cant rhyme and all your beats are weak
you oughta take a peak and check out the technique
seek and you shall find
gangstarr stands for mastermind
simple and plain and yo this aint no game lame

new york new york is where we live and were thorough
never taking shorts cuz brooklyns the borough
peace to uptown to queens and the bronx
long island and jersey get as fly as they want
where we rest is no joke
so let me break it down to sections for you slowpokes
fort green bedstuy flatbush brownsville
crown heights and east new york will be down till
medina takes respect for the styles we bring
cuz in brooklyn we be into our own thing
alantic terminals redhook bushwick
come to brooklyn frontin and youll get mushed quick
we aint just know for flipping and turning out parties
but also for the take no bullshit hotties
on the subject of blackness well let me share this
brooklyn is the home for cultural awareness
so in all fairness you can never compare this
some good some bad little hope for the weak
dangerous streets and coney island beach
all this included when you go for a tour
some can get scandolous and outright raw
when you step step correct and watch where you move
we pay dues so we aint trying to lose
here in brooklyn
the home of the black and the beautiful
for a ruffrap sound aint a place more suitable
other cities claim this and others claim that
but let me give some props to the place where we be at
b-r-double o- k-l-y-n
i came in for a visit and ever since then
ive been incorporated with select personel
right here in brooklyn the place where we dwell

way down in brooklyn 3x
those who live in brooklyn know just what im talking about

verse two

peace to boston philly conneticut dc
all the east coast cities are fly to me
peace to everybody down south and out west
but for me brooklyn new york is the best
dont be afraid to venture over the bridge
although you may run in to some wild ass kids
take the j train the d or the a if you dare
and the 2345 also comes here
theres so much to see cuz brooklyns historic
fools act jealous but you have to ignore it
so i just lounge wit the fat clientel
out here in brooklyn the place where we dwell

way down in brooklyn
you know the placebrave is the knave who steps up to be slayed
by the one who forgave him for his first mistakes
hed best behave or ima send him a wave
of some shocking volts he doesnt know what hes talkin about
hes kickin a bunch of crap so ill be the judge of that
the boy lacks artistry but still he tries hard to be
an entertainer but instead hes a waste of
my time and your time so ill kick the pure rhymes
whenever youre looking for rap thats exceptional
and credible straight to the gs you better go
cause gangstarrs known to be prone to be
masters of streetwise poetry and turntable wizardry
but still be a cold day in hell when you hear that
guru or premier ever tell suckers get sales
but they fail in the long run that kid who went gold yo
that was the wrong one but tonight the spotlight is all on me
im the guru of the g-a-n-g
taking out scrubs cause they rub me the wrong way
and ill say that theyve still got a long way to go
to show they can flow like a real pro
so gimme that loot catch the boot from my steel toe
im changing the scenery as i make em uncomfortable
cause most mcs aint really got no pull
watch me stifle em quick with the gift and the wit
make em quit all that riff as i flip the script

chorus

fool listen i know that youve been missing
all this and so my rhymes are gonna gleem and glisten
like a gem and if you are the fake mc type
ill shine so bright ill be blinding your eyesight
your capabilities fall short so ima treat you like a dwarf
on a basketball court still you try to rap
and even claim you got new styles but
rolling your tongues been playe dout for a while
and you dont sound fly so why are you doing that
you had a dope track but youre wack so you ruined that
i couldnt make out what you were saying your diction
is jumbled where as me im conveying clear thoughts
to a crowd thats most critical
booty duck rappers like you are just pitiful
i bet you couldnt name more than one pioneer
cause you didnt pay dues and you got on on outta nowhere
but thats ok cause im peeping your card
if rap was my house youd be sweeping the yard
as i recline ill find more chores to give ya
like moppin the floors or maybe fetchin my slippers
so dont even trip or run off with the lip
cause as soon as you slip you know ill flip the script

chorus

so as i kick a bit flip with script without a skip
butter roll mcs get dissed like this
youll never got none son because ill become troublesome
you rap like a simpleton
and i hate scum yo i can easily deflect your threats
cause theyre idle my recital will break you down
just a fight til the end cause i can take ten at a time
give em all a fair shot to see if any can rhyme
and even if one is decent ill still get props
ill kick the slick lines til the last one drops
as my powerful skills are unveiled im tippin the scales
and weighing much more than your tall tales
stop the exaggeration perpetration observe
and make simple notation
nobody no where no way no how
is taking me out cause i can throw so you know now
can you feel it i bust raps so lay off
before i steal that so called title that you gave yourself
but you really aint jack so yo you played yourself
and now you look from a distance as you sweat my tip
you know ill whip you swift when i flip the scriptverse one

you know i used to be a player fly girl layer and a heartbreaker
lovemaker backbreaker but then i made a
mistake yes i fell in love with this ill chick
sweatin me for money my name and the dilsnick
my homeboys told me to drop her for it would be to my benefit
she used to say id better quit hanging with those derelects
romancing is my thing but i cant swing with no scheming hoes
wherever my beema goes you know that im driving
surviving in the 90s is a must so i trust
that everyone listen up as my vocals give thrust
i bust my rhymes first never chasing a skirt
do much work while other suckas need more time to rehearse
now back to the ex-girls ex-lovers ex-friends
it made me mad to find that she was only after my ends
she phones me and goes on about her new life now
i wish she knew right now
i think shes busted lets discuss it
when i was with her no trust just fights
just the he-say-she-say and the neighborhood highlights
bow i got my new girl or as i say my baby doll
but im still gettin crazy calls my ex-girls got balls
dont wanna play the field cuz i get lovin at home base
dont gimme no long face just exit with a grace
you and i are the past cest la vie much respect girl
but now youre my ex-girl cuz im on with the next girl

chorus

next
&lt;cuz girls look so good&gt;

verse two

she had much loot liked to buy me fresh-dipped gear
liked to have me near cuz of my svoir faire
the time we shared was brief cuz i needed relief
from her high-classed antics and all her conceit
now shes crying wolf and i like dont wanna hear that
i told her the bear facts when things started out
she wines and she pouts about how i did her bad
yo but shed tried to buy me
even tempt me with the hiney
i fell for a sec cuz the clothes were real fly
i could almost feel i
would give into her whims
her thoughts were erratic sporadic crazy in nature
i told her hey look i can no longer date ya
tried to pimp with bank and fell short your ship sank
many thanks for the time and the watch and the link
you and i are the past cest la vie nuff respect girl
but now youre my ex-girl cuz im straight with the next girl

chorus

verse three

you saw my mom in the supermarket and gave her your number
you asked hows my sister then asked hows my brother
didnt ask about my father cuz you know he aint like ya
every time i left for your crib yo hed really get hyper
the advice he used to give me makes much sense now
i cant believe i used to let you break my confidence down
you used to ask me why the hell did i wanna live in brooklyn
you messed up my flow although you were good-lookin
yes darlin was fly and this was the problem
cuz back in the day she had me scheming and robbin
to get her things to wear so when she went to the club
all eyes were on her and me i just bugged
caught in between felling proud and feeling more like a sucker
had to go undercover get away find another
been in brooklyn 9 years and been around the world too
ive seen so many fly girls and i knew just what to do
i went from ex-girl to next took my time with each one
and you know they still love me so stop jellin me hon
went home to see mom and i saw you at the bus stop
must i stop nah i think not
you and i are the past cest la vie much respect girl
but now youre my ex-girl &amp; im out with the next girl
out

chorusfive carloads deep time to go do a show
got a massive crew and were ready to roll so
i grab my gear hop in the whip and ride
premier hes got the fly dope system inside
but my shit cranks too and weve got mad tapes
of all the underground groups with the lyrics and bass
off into the new york night we go
dre large got the camera biggest gords got three rolls of film
so we can take the macked out photos
tommy hill the damaja and my man gusmo
corey and smurf and lil daps got a forty
my man gary and shiz and the nutcracker shorty
mike rone chillin like capone
robinhood known as mel with the clientele
mo jt mega and cant forget black
big rob and sincere yes the posses fat
outloud pulls up plus theres sid and oc
big mel from strong island hl the one and only
odelicious eli bazz and eon
and the aroma of the blunts has me thinking beyond
and to the rest of the crew you know the bond is strong
and you know whos who so let me not prolong
for this was a night to remember
i had on the beige tims with the two-tone leather
so we get to the jam the gig the venue
then we circled around and then drove in through
the front - the place was packed the line was long
i was bobbing my head cause the music was on
i turned it down then i peeped to my right
i saw this kid and his girl having a fight
another kid walked up and mushed the kid in his face
and then the kid pulled out and bust him and laid him to waste
a riot broke out girls screaming and scheming crews
started buck wiling tryna snatch kids jewels
after that 5-0 came and turned the party out
and then the ambulance came to take the body out
and we didnt even get all the equipment out
and we didnt even get to turn the place out
this can happen often and its really fucked up
so ill ask you to your face homeboy whats up
did you come to see my show or to the stupid nigga playoffs
killing you and killing me its the soliloquy of chaos

and if you live in cities where the streets reek warfare
people getting nowhere but you go for yours there
youll find it doesnt pay to front or play the role
you could get stole or maybe beat with a pole
then youll wanna retaliate regroup and come back
so you set the brothers up for a sneak attack
whether you die or kill them its another brother dead
but i know youll never get that through your head
cause were mislead and misfed facts were way off
killing you and killing me its the soliloquy of chaosfeat lil dap &amp; jeru the damaja

verse one guru

i say people people come on and check it out now
you see the mic in my hand now watch me wreck it now
what is a party if the crew aint there
whats your name call me guru thats my man premier
now many attempts have been made to hold us back
slander the name and with-hold facts
but im the type of brother with much more game
i got a sure aim and if i find youre to blame
you can bet youll be exterminated taken out done
it doesnt matter how many theyll go as easy as just one
bust one round in the air for this here
cuz this year suckers are going no where
cuz my strret style and intelligence level
makes me much more than just an angry rebel
im gifted unlimited rhymes universal
mcs that aint equipped get flipped in my circle
im aiming on raining on the bitch ass chumps
cuz their rhymes dont flow and their beats dont pump
and niggaz better know i paid my dues and shit
im bout to blow the fuck up because i refuse to quit
im out to get the props that are rightfullly mine
yeah me and the crew think its about that time
but on the dl you know that gangstarr will conquer
thats why you stare and point and others cling on to
my nautica asking for a hookup
well sorry but my schedule is all booked up
nobody put me on i made it up the hard way
look out for my people but the suckers should parlay
cuz its business kid this aint no free for all
you have to wait your turn you must await your call
so now now it is my duty to 
eliminate and subtract all of the booty crews
and suckers should vacate
before i get irate
and ill kick your can 
from here to japan
with force you cant withstand 
cuz im the muthafuckin man

break guru

yo right now i got my man lil dap from the group home
yo step up to the mic and tell them why youre the man

verse two lil dap

so much anger built inside
so dont stop to say hi muthafucka just die
my shit holds a mouthful so i guess you know whats up
why punks get killed at the end of the month
styles and styles i flip
lil dap remains sick
yes the group home is thick
so all you punks hear this
everytime you riff
the more fame that we get
muthafuckas act hard
thinking that they are god
niggaz just dont understand
let me be my own man
did everything on my own
and everyplace wasnt home
everywhere that id rest
i had to dress with a vest
i guess you get the routine but with a lot of stress
frustration on my mind
brothers doin mad time
rhymes are organized like crime
as were rippin the lines
brothers just dont know
how shit got to go
cuz i was told
to never give my back to the street
as i walk through the ghetto 
dead souls i greet
see my man give him pound
then i walk with a frown
another minute 
another brothers gunned down
shit is getting too close thats why the group home is thick
so everytime you riff the more fame that we get
my father always said dont watch the one across the street
watch the one right next
bcuz hes easy to flex
took heed to what he said
yeah that deep ass nigga
while brothers hang around
tryin to get down
niggaz just dont understand
im the mutha fuckin man

break guru

and also on the set from dirty rotten scoundrels
we got my man jeru the damaja
yo tell them why youre the man

verse three jeru the damaja

ill tap your jaw
you probably heard it before
step to the bedlamite ill prove my word is law
drugstore with more
dope rhyme vendor
not partial to beef
the chief ambassador
niggaz get mad cuz they cant score
like a wild west flick they wish to shoot up my door
but i incite a riot
dont even try it
bust up chumps so crab kids keep quiet
like i said before
i tap jaws
snatch whores
kill suckers in wars
vic a style you said was yours
money grip wanna flip but youre fish
house the mic like your hooker and did tricks on the bitch
dirty rotten scoundrel and my name is jeru
utilizing my tools in 92
mcs step up in mobs to defeat us
when we rock knots and got props like norm peterson
lots of friends lots of fun lots of beers
got the skills kreeno so i always get cheers
troop on like a trooper no tears for fears
im a get mines cuz the crewll get theirs
cut you up like edward scissorhands
you know the program im the mutha fuckin man<span style=padding1em><img alt=trebleclef class= data-image-key=trebleclefpng data-image-name=trebleclefpng height=68 src=http//vignette2wikianocookienet/lyricwiki/images/1/1e/trebleclefpng/revision/latest/scale-to-width/30cb=20090423154754 width=30/></span> instrumentali never thought that you would crab me
undermine me and backstab me
but i can see clearly now the rain is gone
the pain is gone but what you did was still wrong
there was a few times i needed your support
but you tried to play me like an indoor sport
like racquetball tennis pool whatever
all i know is you attempted to be clever
nevertheless cleverness cant impress
cause now youve been expose like a person undressed
cause i see through you im the guru
now what you gonna do when i step to you
and when i pay you back ill be hurting you
this aint no threat so take it personal

rap is an art you cant own no loops
its how you hook em up and the rhyme style troop
so dont even think you could say someone bit
off your weak beat come on you need to quit
i flip lines and rhymes that never sound like yours
there oughtta be laws against you yapping your jaws
originality overflows from in me
and the truth is that you wish you could live the
life i live and kick the lyrics i kick
but bear in mind that you cant think as quick
so premier drops a beat for me to say verses to
and if i sound doper then take it personal

dont be mad cause i dont come around the way
like i used to i dont have time these days
im keeping busy making power moves
dont try to say i dont remember you
you shouldnt let your jealousy show like that
i stopped coming by cause of the way you act
telling my business to kids i dont even know
youre like a daytime talk show and thats low
so you can tell everyone that im jerking you
and if you dont like it kid take it personalverse one

im 2 deep and yes much too complicated
my lines when stated are quite often underrated
so consider it a privilege to hear this
those weak-minded opinions could never come near this
for my outlook on life is a profound view
whil the suckers act down thinking that they sound new
only a few sound true
me and the crew know who
cuz you see me and the fellas have been waiting for a while now
giving you the time to get your wack-ass style down
you punks pop junk as if life is a fantasy
knowing that hard is something you cant be
so you front but you could never call my bluff
cuz youll catch hell youll get dealt with

chorus

i never sleep
i always peep
rhymes creep
im 2 deep
im 2 deep

verse two

i forgive you sike im takin your life
cuz you continue to disrespect so ima get trife
but then again i think ill spare ya
cuz i know tht all it takes one rhyme just to scare ya
see im the holder of the key 
dont ask me if im muslim dont say nothin to me 
i said i was raised like one son i had two cousins 
they pushed me to find myself or else they knew i wasnt
gonna make it and then end up a statistic
my life was twisted i almost missed it
the chance yes the chance to make you feel good
i used to steal goods and fake my parents out real good
but now i got k-n-o-w-l-e-d-g-e of self cuz im me
and the nation of islam has my support 
cuz they try to reeducate the ones who are lost
and the 5 percent nation takes other steps
to get through to brothers on the corners with the reps
and in the prison they give the brothers new visions
of how we can gain wealth gain self esteem  and dream
of a total different scene i dress clean stand lean 
say what i mean and im out
like a scout on a new route exhibitting clout

chorus

verse three

for right now yo my religion is rhyming
perfect timing test the flow and climb in
ansaar sunnite sheite jihad
all must regard the times are hard
unite or perish
is the message i cherish
that goes for my people of all religions
if were all black why have so many divisions
superficial factors are drawing us apart 
dont let it happen
lets put some respect back in
so before i act i think cuz its the brink of destruction
word corruption whats up son your gun is just one
and i just might have one 
or two or maybe even three or four
and plus an army of 100 or more
but violence is never my first choice
i come in peace to release the effect of my voice

chorus<span style=padding1em><img alt=trebleclef class= data-image-key=trebleclefpng data-image-name=trebleclefpng height=68 src=http//vignette2wikianocookienet/lyricwiki/images/1/1e/trebleclefpng/revision/latest/scale-to-width/30cb=20090423154754 width=30/></span> instrumentalas i deliver rhymes with ease and walk around with my head up
im dead up serious so dont be getting too curious
motherfuckers always wanna know what makes me tick
ill pull a phrase out quick cuz im dipped and im slick
you thought that i would slip cuz you seen me drinking fortys
it shocked you then you told your friends you saw me
well say what you want cuz all of mine is in tact
in fact ill have you open like a hookers gap
i like to catch a buzz cuz i get into the beats more
mcs are washed up like dead fish on the seashore
save the talk cuz you know i walk that walk
hitting city to city but i make my home in new york
i know the time with this rap shit cuz they got it all backwards
they need to take a hint or catch my microphone imprint
straight to the dome through the skull to the tissue
call me guru ill diss you if youre pressing the issue
not my style to be sweatin all the stupid ass rumors
i take it as a compliment and fuck you too
if youre scheming on the chance to put a stain on my name
dont even think about it cuz aint no shame in my game

no shame in my game

stick to the subject i aint afraid to be real
a lot of mcs fake hard just to gain appeal
i like some gangster rap dont like the prankster crap
so i get passed all that by kicking straight up facts
there aint no reason to shoot unless you got beef
if you pull out and you dont use it than you may catch grief
toolies and techs aint toys but kids got em today
and if theyre ready to spray best get the fuck out the way
i try keeping my sanity by thinking of better times
if i write clever rhymes then maybe ill climb
but what the hells success if the mess aint changing
50s still corrupt stupid gangs still bangin
stick up kids still stickin nasty hookers still trickin
all the pimps still pimpin and all the crackheads trippin
while the dealers still sellin so ill refrain from the yellin
and the preachin cuz who the fuck would i reach man
niggaz dont wanna stop that they wanna live fat
whod wanna clean up their act when the papes come in stacks
they live for the minute and theyre all wrapped up in it
its an unfortunate state for many its too late
now death stalks the streets and its right at your gate
so bug lose your mind but i aint goin insane
ill kick the fly lyrics cuz aint no shame in my game

no shame in my game

lifes a bitch so who are we to judge each other
i know i got faults i aint the only motherfucker
stuff i heard about you wasnt too cool you know
like how you smoke wools and that your girls a ho
but i dont listen to shit unless the storys legit
knuckleheads need to quit cuz they be riding the dilsnick
but ill be taking care of business regardless
and when it comes to rhyming you know im hitting hardest
so you can kick dirt but in the end youll feel pain
you little sucker there aint no shame in my gameyou cant tell me life was meant to be like this
a black man in a world dominated by whiteness
ever since the declaration of independence
weve been easily brainwashed by just one sentence
it goes all men are created equal
thats why corrupt governments kill innocent people
with chemical warfare they created crack and aids
got the public thinking these were things that black folks made
and every time theres violence shown in the media
usually its a black thing so where are they leading ya
to a world full of ignorance hatred and prejudice
tv and the news for years they have fed you this
foolish notion that blacks are all criminals
violent low lifes and then even animals
im telling the truth so some suckers are fearing me
but i must do my part to combat the conspiracy

the sat is not geared for the lower class
so why waste time even trying to pass
the educational system presumes you to fail
the next place is the corner then after that jail
youve got to understand that this has all been conspired
to put a strain on our brains so that the strong grow tired
it even exists when you go to your church
cuz up on the wall a white jesus lurks
they use your subconscious to control your will
theyve done it for a while and developed the skill
to make you want to kill your own brother man
black against black you see its part of their plan
they want to send us to war and they want to ban rap
what they really want to do is get rid of us blacks
genocide is for real and i hope that youre hearing me
you must be aware to combat the conspiracy

even in this rap game all that glitters aint gold
now that rap is big business the snakes got bold
they give you wack contracts and try to make you go pop
cuz they have no regard for real hip-hop
theyll compare you to others and say but yo he sells
and you know in your heart that hes weak as hell
so you say i aint doing that corny stuff
but they tell ya that your chart positions will go up
sometimes they front big time and make you many promises
and when they break em then your mama says
son youre making records but that guy seems shady
it could be too late and your career could be played gee
i hope you listen to the things that im sharing see
we all have a job to combat the conspiracychorus
gotta be the illest brother to claim respect
it takes the illest brother just to get respect
got to be the illest brother when its time to get wreck
got to be the illest brother when i get my mic check

im one of the illest brothers known to man
but if you dont understand see im a grown man
and i stand 58 and 3 quarters
giving orders to my sqaudron cuz im like the sergeant 
or general but let me keep this minimal
i used to hang with kids who like to live trife with a knife
cutting kids for fun and pulling out much guns
and like riflery champs fellas start to get real amped
dead bodies lay stamped to the pavement so i gave it some thought
remembering the brothers who are gone now
i will make a strong vow to make things right
ignite the mic get hype and all that
suckers try to menace but they always fall
flat to the ground as i astound come around
ill put you down about the brothers who think theyre the boss
think theyre getting large but in the end they pay the cost
of their lives and that aint the way to go out
even take their boys with em cause they know their boys will go out
but when it comes to facing some time
theyre like crying like weeping wanna call mom dukes
but mom dukes is fed fed up with the shit you did
she knows that you shot and she knows that you cripples kids
but whos to judge when youre trying to survive
the one who moves first might be the one to stay alive
so when you think youre hard and dominating the set
just remember the illest brother claims respect

like i said im an ill kid so never dare test me
they wanna arrest me cuz im causing a frenzy
fake gangsters come and fake gangsters go
real gangsters chill cuz real gangsters know
that quietly you stalk your prey on the down low
cuz too much talk will get you beef on the street
and brothers in the city have to live this way
it may cause dismay but imma tell it anyway
yo guns are easy to get and like a puppet
some young kid is gonna be the subject of internal oppression
an example of hard times
cuz to make it out the trap in your mind its a hard climb
but even if you change and come right and exact
theres another brother scheming so just watch your back
i know a brother who thought he had it all
but little did he know he was bound for a down fall
hed pick up the heater and go stick somebody
he wouldnt give a damn if he killed somebody
cuz if somebody would get in the way of him getting loot
thered be no hesitation hed just shoot
its like the good the bad and the ugly
except its reality and you dont see it on tv
brothers keep dying in the streets cuz the streets are designed 
to keep you from having peace of mind
i know an old man hes got a rifle to stifle 
any young punk he hides it under his bunk
and i know a kid whos been to jail
and he told me that the system had failed him
so now hes out the joint and hes like flippin on kids
and the people in his neighborhood are flippin their wigs
but you gotta check the move cuz theres a reason
a method to the madness and you know what im meaning
cuz rather than being the herb vic or chump
you can be just like my man cold holding the pump
but living like that you take a chance with your life
but some things in life sometimes will make you uptight
im like an avalanche of knowledge pounding down all fools
all fakes all snakes
and ones who try to break the rules and regulations
stipulations made by the gangstarr
you try to flex muscle but you know you cant hang ha
youre making me vexed but yeah you can go next
just remember the illest brother claims respect

chorus repeat

yo money dont front you know you blew your chance
and now its my turn so imma take command
cuz im like the one whos got all the juice
i always get loose i got the balls to reduce your crew
very easily i got more ammo
im like the ill kid the psycho man yo
cuz now im past the point and i aint gonna return
and when it comes to your destruction i aint really concerned
about the consequences cuz im living day to day
so who are you to comment about me and my ways
i get my attitude from living and i never forget
you got to be the illest brother just to claim respectnow i got you looking stiff you numbskull youre at a stand still
still faking that youre hard with your rhymes and got no hand skills
so ill easily drop you and stop you from rhyming
send you home to moms all bruised up and crying
then if you want you can go call your people
youre gonna need a mob against me cause im lethal
not that im a violent brother to the contrary
my vocals carry and then i bury
mcs in holes that they dug for themselves
couldnt be themselves so they sold themselves
to a company exec who doesnt have respect
for real rap music so he wants to get an mc
that starts out street to crossover
but not me cause im the hardcore composer

you aint a writer nor a fighter youre just a biter
i think you need to save all that because in spite
of the reputation that you think you have
the crew already knows that youre really a crab
so ill grab the mic with haste and send you out of this place
and back to trace my flow but dont waste your time bro
it only takes a minute a second for me to switch
and rearrange real quick cause i can kick plenty styles
rhymes stretch many miles
im the authentic yes the lyric unloader
the truth exposer the hardcore composer

all you delirious curious suckers
you better act like youve been known i mack
and hold my own with a mike just to stagger
a bragger retire a lair and very easily
im pass by ya cause you didnt want to give the credit
where it was due yeah it was you uh huh it was you
and your crummy corny ass crew
so we shall enforce that you lost and plus you oughta
find another type of life and yes another source of income
and heres some advice you cant rap this nice
i broke ya over and over i told ya
i would mold ya why  because im bound
to give original sound and as your ears pound
bringing pleasure and pain
as brains start to gain from musical measures
forming mystical questions never typical inventions
developed by my gifted unlimited mind
suckers wanna rhyme cause theyre eager to find
the secret behind the way that i stomp all comp
just like a timberland its the guru and premier
its them again droppin the fly tracks
and taking things over and never selling out
cause im the hardcore composerim like a sniper rhymesll strike ya when im rockin
mad chicks be jockin when the g starrs talking
and thats because my word is bond
i get much fan mail and i always respond
so tell your hon to write me too
make sure she puts attention mr guru
brothers know the flow is unique
i got 100 wild styles in my black valise
mcs wanna be me so they keep askin
for me to teach em methods both slow and fast
and others wanna act as if theyre better
but they only got one style which aint all that clever
im cooler than wind harder than cold steel
i get the ladies with more than just sex appeal
a mystic psychic scanning all your thoughts
ill touch your soul and make your brain feel caught
when my rapture traps ya and makes you mine
youll submit to the gift and to the lyrical lines
so suckers realize that the size is too large
when i come through im pullin whole crews cards
i be wreckin correct and on the gang starr tip
mcs who front imma gonna bust your shit

i wonder do you love it enough
im steppin rugged and tough never to front or to bluff
i got the fresh cut baldy the brothers call me
guru the man yes with all the
j-a-z-z-y type essence street type lessons manifesting
the one who make the fly ladies feel pleasant
never forgettin that to myself im true
do what you want to but watch yourself though duke
i dont wanna hear all of that loud mouthing
try to pull yours out when nothing comes out
then youll see why you cant compete with me
the notorious guru of the gang you see
starr stands for power like i said before
im like the doctors cure slicker than roger moore
i slide up to a crab mc like this
tap em in the head with my mic like this
ill be revealing that youre weak to the world if you wish
and i insist that if you persist
then you get creamed cuz imma get real steamed
so dont you try to flex and try to look all mean
heyo check it thats dead thats it
cuz all you phony ass rappers imma bust your shit

now when you see me on the set you know i may unleash
a lyric like a mad dog barking through the speaker
step off unless you wanna get torn up
your raps worn out burnt out fucked up
you lucked up or maybe you lucked out
cuz at the battle last time you snuck out
but now im rolling over you full blast
im here to let you know no longer will the bull last
mcs telling lies and poppin all those myths
keep on fakin moves and immaverse one

other mcs in the place know im much too much
and ill bust em all up without even cussing
all wannabes are never ever gonna be nothin
gang starrs in the house and were crushing
so suckers better be up on their ps and qs and
competition come against me and youre losing
ill use a simple style just to catch you snoozing
wake up wake up kid read the news and
take heed cuz you need to see how battles are won
when a real man displays how it must be done
and i snuff bum mcs and keep the cashflow comin
and never had no problems getting women
im like a catalyst causin a chain reaction
dopest vocalist ad now the main attractionn
things turn gold at my slightest touch
thats why the people say that im much too much

chorus

im much too much
im much too much
im much too much
im much too much

verse two

check the g-u-r-u yes the brother whos progressing
if beats are cake im frosting if salad im dressing
never stressing or guessing or messing around man
just turn up the system so the beat can be pounding
blasting out your radio my vocals surrounding
take a trip uptown and come back down and
and kick it with the fellas i call my crew so
im gettin kinda fat like a big huge sumo
i figure that im due and its true cuz you know
a rapper this nice oughtta clock mad dough
not the stuff from the baker but the loot yo the paper
i set up shop and drop gems and catch em later
cuz im like keeping it moving improving steadily
pumping kinda loud in your blazer or cherokee
doesnt matter what you drive automatic or clutch
just pop in my tape cuz im much too much

chorus

verse three

i walk in the room unload a boom thats like sonic
my slick voice to the beat is symphonic
to a biting mc my lines are toxic and chronic
my mystical style is like harmonic
ive rarely had a difficulty slaying mcs
cuz the ones who were toughest still begged on their knees
and i wreck the set with the greatest of ease
and you know im swift like the breeze
ill never understand why a wack rapper tries and
convinces himself that his image is so fly and
thats the type of crap you know im not buying
chumps lack the beats and their rhymes dont apply and
thats why ive come into your life today
just to make you sweat in my unique way
im controlling all action dissing mc ducks
thats why everybody knows that im much too much

chorus

ladies and maybe get my homeboys some ass
all you gotta do is take two pulls and pass

chorus

even in the morning like the flavor of juice
a blunt adds spice and a blunt can spruce
up your day but im not advertising just telling

you can call em but i know em
sweet mcs i think ill ho em

the bottom line is win or lose
suckers suckers suckers dont be listening
so i cant be waitin on em
i aint got no time to play do you
look at the state of things and tell me true
in the city any city lifes a paradox of good and evil
many fall into the vicious cycle
living by the gun or by the rifle
think they got a reason that aint really sure
the death toll rises more
its trife the way some live life
i love rap i like the city
but for a fool i have no pity
therestoo much suffering too much struggle
too much injustice and dont it bug you
enough for you to press on harder
against the odds the wayn our forefathers
made away but foolishly we go astray
think about it and stay tuned

chorus

verse three

what you really oughta do is lay back smooth
as my vocals compliment the slow fat groove
just for you to blast around the way
play it nice and loud and hear me say
gang starr is hitting 92 and on
showing how to make a dope rap song
doing this while some disperse
then dissolve like specs of dirt
our music pertains to those who remain
down with the real not wealth or the fame

chumps pull guns when they feel afraid too late
when they dip in the kick they get sprayed

premier scratches and hookssick thoughts on my mind with no self-control

god bless the dead and god rest my pops
peace to the niggaz goin out bustin shotsverse one guru

no way youll never make it
come with the weak shit i break kids

a lot of rappers be like one time wonders
couldnt say a fly rhyme if there was one right under
their noses i hate those motherfuckin posers
but im so real to them its scary
and with my unique skills nah you cant compare me
and no we dont make wack tracks
and all the suckers get pushed back when im kickin real facts
i represent set up shit like a tent boy
youre paranoid cause youre my son like elroy
and youd be happy as hell to get a record deal
maybe your soul youd sell to have mass appeal

verse two

oh yes im greater than all mcs when i breeeze give me room please
i be like fascinatin when i be updatin
cuttin off wack kids pullin their trump cards
i thump hard and make em say that im god
niggaz be pretendin they hardcore

but i get props like a slogan and no man
could ever try to diss when i kicks my jam
lyrically def and connecting complete mic wrecking
no double checking vocals kill like weapons
but if i have to i go all out with no mic
yeah thats right cause i survived mad fights
and for my peeps i truly care
cause without some of them i wouldnt be here
and they all know how i feel
cause suckers be like playin themselves to have mass appeal

verse three

i know im dope but dont wet that
ive suffered setbacks but now im makin greenbacks
just like baggy slacks im crazy hip-hop
check one two and you dont stop
your headll bop when i drop my crop
of pure bomb just like the seashore im calm
but wild with my monotone style
because i dont need gimmicks
gimme a fly beat and im all in it
word is bond i go on and on
for you its tragic i got magic like wands
so ima end this lecture and i betcha
those who kick dirt and do time im gonna get cha
cause i be kickin the real
while they be losin the race tryin to chase mass appealguru
ah so now ya got me pissed off blast off lift off
time for me to twist off a vocal fist off
into your domepiece homepeace i heard your chick wants to bone me
i get wild like rugby respected like bugsy
dont even ask me cause im livin lovely
born to succeed foes bleed true indeed
the oral combat will romp that your one of my seeds
when i first busted on the scene
nigga you knew i had more than a gangsta lean
i mean my lean is gangsta though so check it
ill stick an mc for his spot and sign in blood on his wack record
boo-ya-ka to your face as i ruin ya
clown ya dumbfound ya while im screwin the
fuck out cha girl as she steps into my world
im not the tallest but that ass ill polish
and if the hooker runs her mouth she gets cut off
but then youll sweat her cause like my leather youre butter soft
your style stinks kid ya garbage
and if you keep talkin shit ima make ya pay homage
cause the g to the u to the r-u came too far to
let you slide through rhymes will scar you

* premier scratches *

guru
i go from one format then switch to the next
reflex sets the pitch vocals rip through projects
crazy shouts are heard all around 
cause the gangstarr sound carries more weight per pound
i got some brand new timbs so emcees sing new hymns
you betta repent come correct represent
or get stomped smacked and slapped cap peeled back
i got you open and now you cling to my sac
get off hands off stay off youre way off
you rookie motherfuckers its the finals not the playoffs
ill break you up into particles to small pieces
because your brain is miniscule
you little fool come learn the tools of the trade
i made the rules so go to school and get played
just when youre thinkin that your jam is hot
up steps the niggaz who be blowin up the spotmcs be fakin so now they get taken

chorus

fake mcs they always act hard
but wont walk the street without their bodyguard
i hate fake mcs they always act hard
but wont walk the street without their bodyguard

verse one

mcs i lay out like stiffs in the morgue
praise the lord youre in awe when im gripping my mic cord
rhymes i rip with swift execution
one verse could coerce your girl to prostitution
the guru is now the brother that you fear and
beware when im making hits with premier and
rolling to a spot near you lyrics tear through
chrome to your dome you better watch your rear view
niggas been held back too long were coming up
in the streets we roll alone so watch me running up
im summing up a mad posse of warriors
night crusaders able to break down barriers
and bringing faces of death putting mcs to rest
until theres no fake chumps left
run step yeah bounce nigga bounce
my rhymes a cargo when yours is just a quarter ounce 

chorus 4x

verse two

gangstarr boy and thats beyond your comprehension
mad brothers in every city you can feel the tension
to stop the killing wack mcs must die
who am i  im the substance thatll make your third eye cry
too potent too high in intelligence quotient
when i unleash my speech ill have you punk rappers open
i wont expose your names and your identities
you know youre phoney get the fuck from in front of me
hardcore fans are fed up from your folklore
lines strip you raw and infect you like cold sores
and i hope youre not the one that im after
since the days of adidas ive been a true master

chorus 4x

verse three

ive been around punk but yo i still feel young
a few of my crew members like to pack guns
im high strung but dont mistake me when i smile
i murder an entire rap chart with my freestyle
after the killing just like casper; im ghost
fakes thought i was friendly at their wakes i was host
toast without a gun youd be done
throw up your hands bitch and now you know you stand to lose one
choose one metaphor and then choose another
wax that ass like a bully have you calling your big brother
although im five foot eight they call me sergeant
got more hoes in my dick than you can fit in the garden
at madison square i shot a fair one
so many niggaz knew me that the kid wouldnt dare run
mcs pay cash to ensure their safety
they know they cant take me; the g-a-n-g you crazy
i be on them like a message from god
knowledge of self while fake mcs play hard

chorus 4x

outro 2x

fake mcs they always act hard
im not a sucker so i dont need a bodyguardguru

yo duke youre dead wrong
youll never have the skills like mine
i write the ill type rhymes
now im reaching my prime
360 dunk in your face
you cant compete youre just a basketcase
lets separate the men from the boys
and put your money where your mouth is
no time for toys
your game is weak get it so dont sleep
cuz ill be checking and wrecking ya
when i start to creep 
through the backdoor
i know i caught you out there 
you got no clout here
and i doubt there
is anyway that you can stop the beatdown
you better play the background
and sit back down 
chumps like you i gotta keepem in line
so prepare to suffer boy cuz now youre mine

dj premier scratching

ill fake you left and go right
straight down the lane
heres one in your eye
you feel pain you strain
to put together some strategy
but youre raggedy and ill be glad to see
the frown on your grill when i drill and thrill
set out my offense commence to kill
ill be leading from beginning to end
and after i guard ya
youre gonna wanna make friends
and make amends for the silly trash you were talking
take a walk and your shots im swatting
with ease and the ladies are swooning
clocking my swiftness why you drooling
you oughtta practice up and get your game with mine
i been waiting to guard you and now youre mine

dj premier scratching

hurry up sucker
go ahead and pick your squad
try to play hard but ima rob
you of your crazy notions to defeat me
your weak see
i rock all courts
and even get down to give you a rematch
after i wax and tax that butt
when i slam the alley-oop
you can rally troops
but i play the awesome defense
ill pick your pocket
and send you to the bench
with tears in your eyes as you realize
the prize is for me
yes all the money
son my flow is too nice
my handles precise
ill fake you right and go left
because my games so def and now youre mine

dj premier scratchingrefrain

its mostly tha voice that gets you up
its mostly tha voice that makes you buck
a lot of rappers got flavor and some got skills
but if your voice aint dope then you need to chill chill 

up steps one and he gets done
then up steps another he gets smothered
thats word to mother or should i say moms
i drop bombs scorchin niggaz like napalm
sucka boy get off my shit
get off my dick so what i make butter hits
you better change your behavior battling gangstarr
no religion could save ya
my religion is rap r-a-p
r-e-a-l-i-t-y g
cause when i rock street kids rejoice
i got mad rhymes still

refrain

so when you think you know the whole you dont even know the half
youre not a threat to myself and neither to my staff
not the type to really dance too much although i used to
rather bust a fresh line and get loose to
the blunted ill types of beats premier makes
makes your girls rear shake let me set it straight

refrain

some rappers use hooks to this shit
but if you took that shit out
and you took all the music out
what would remain  the voice no doubt
bless my soul i control
when in pimp mode
my bank roll expands
i invest in my man
i plan to keep rap real
so if your shit aint fat then kneel
you squeal feeling pain from my oral flex
what about oral sex which chicks next
to open wide and get a chunk from a real brother
yeah some real funk from a real brother
they get sprung and most of them dont recover
but i dont diss em i just talk to em
cause the sound of my voice it does a lot to em
so you and the niggaz right there
be aware like swv im right here
waitin to correct your ass
and if you dont follow now ill disrespect your ass
more vicious than sid do a crime with no bid
i tell a bitch that i didnt when you know that i did
take a trip to a land a-far
then come back and people still know gangstarr
see im the ladies choice
cause i got crazy styles still

refrain

my pen illuminates and dooms the fakes
youre soon to break youre strawberry like shortcake
im in that ass with my timbs all day
you couldnt tarnish my rep so you crept away
just behave and be a good son -- or else
im bringin the noise cause most emcees are puns
i used to chill in roxbury now im comin outta brooklyn
herb niggaz are assed out yall get tooken
or taken and thats word to all rude bwoy jamaican
i swing bitch yes im crankin
just like an alpine a deadly rhyme brand spankin new
pumped to put some lead in your crew
a hollow point shot cause your weak shallow points
not hittin -- shouldve gave up from the beginning
but since youre bluffin with your tape thats trash
tell your peeps that we comin for datazz

here we come here we come here we kiddy-come-come --&gt; run-dmc

whose that lurkin in the dark with the hoodie strapped;
puffin on a blizz mellow meditatin black
i aint impressed cause the rest they fess
sometimes i wanna flip clap a hole in they chest
but i lay back as i prepare for the payback
and drop the master rhymes with the mad crew from wayback
i stay back i watch the whole job you botched
couldnt maintain its like your brain just stopped
but the gang is on the prowl kid like lector
paint a logo with your blood so you niggaz remember
the chain and the star mysticle and never typical
the average rap group aint even equipped to go
head up im dead up you ducks could never last
you fakin jacks we comin for datazz

here we come here we come here we kiddy-come-come --&gt; run-dmc

i heard some hardheaded punks wanna see me
jealous of a nigga just because hes on tv
you know the video shows that you be watchin
call up and request so you can see it more often
my persona sheds more light than a nova
cause niggaz are soldier yo this war it aint over
and aint no stopping like mcfadden and whitehead
you might get dead fuckin around like you do
pursue the knowledge thats available
before your chump-style game and your punk friends fail you
gonna dissect your brain for a minute
look at your puny ass world and whats in it
nothin thats how long youve been frontin
i figured by now that youve come up with somethin
but youre still the same snake with my name on your mouth
wanna know what im doin wanna know why i shine
cause im the rebirth so now you gotta see me first
i kick more facts than paperbacks for research
and knees hurt next you feel em bucklin
the huge pussy look on your face reveals the sucker
inside of ya because i checked the way youre ridin the
jimsome better sing more than a hymn son
never sustain the true pain of my wisdom
never be able to touch gangstarr
true indeed i believe in takin my words far
across the seas and deserts through the trees and grass

* dj premier cuts n scratches *guru
that makes me know that we we we were doin
we had the right idea in the beginning
and and we just need to maintain our focus and elevate
we what we do we update our formulas
we have certain formulas but we update em oh right
with the times and everything yknow
and and so yknow
the rhyme style is elevated
the style of beats is elevated
but its still guru and premier
and its always a message involved

the real hip-hop
mcing and djing from your own mind ya know
i i guess right now we should start the show

[guru]
whos the suspicious character strapped with the sounds profound
similar to rounds spit by derringers
youre in the terrordome like my man chuck d said
its time to dethrone you clones and all you knuckleheads
cause mcs have used up extended warranties
while real mcs and djs are a minority
but right about now i use my authority
cause im like the wizard and you look lost like dorothy
the horror be when i return for my real people
words that split wigs hittin like some double desert eagles
sportin caps pulled low and baggy slacks
subtractin all the rappers who lack over premiers tracks
severe facts have brought this rap game to near collapse
so as i have in the past i whup ass
droppin lyrics that be hotter than sex and candlewax
and one-dimensional mcs cant handle that
while the worlds revolvin on its axis
i come with mad love and plus the illest warlike tactics
the wilderness is filled with this; so many people
searching for false lift im here with the skills youve missed
the rejected stone is now the cornerstone
sort of like the master builder when i make my way home
you know my steez

[method man] you know my steez
let em know do your thing yall keep it live
[flavor flav] to the beat yall

the beat is sinister primo makes you relax
im like the minister when i be lacin the wax
i be bringin salvation through the way that i rap
and you know and i know im nice like that
work through worldly problems i got the healing power
when the mics within my reach im feelin more power
stealing at least three minutes of every rap radio hour
its often easier for one to give advice
than it is for a person to run ones own life
thats why i cant be caught up in all the hype
i keep my soul tight and let these lines takes flight
the apparatus gets blessed and suckers get put to rest
no more of the unpure i got the cure for this mess
the wackness is spreadin like the plague
mcs lucked up and got paid but still cant make the fuckin grade
how many times are wannabes gonna lie
yo they must wanna fry they cant touch the knowledge i personify
i travel through the darkness carrying my torch
the illest soldier when im holding down the fort
[method man] you know my steez
you know my steez

let em know do your thing yall keep it live
[method man] you know my steez
[repeat x4 with very last line modified as follows]
the mic

on the microphone you know that im one of the best yet
some punks aint paid all of their debts yet
tryin to be fly ridin high on the jet-set
with juvenile rhymes makin fake-ass death threats
big deal like en vogue heres something you can feel
styles more tangible and image more real
for some time now ive held the scrolls and manuscripts
when its time to go all out you be like damn he flipped
now im sick fed up with the bullshit
got the lyrical full clip giving you a verbal asswhip
dont trip its the gifted prolific one
known as bald head slick -- why is the press all on my di-dick
my style be wilder than a kamikaze pilot
dont try it im about to start more than a friggin riot
styles unsurpassable and nuccas thats suckas yo
them motherfuckers are harrassable
for i be speaking from my parables and carry you beyond
the mics either a magic wand
or it gets tragic like the havoc of a nuclear bomb
then i grab your palm no pulse youre gone
and if you thought wed lose our niche in this rap shit you way wrong
i stay up i stay on shine bright like neon
your songs pathetic synthetic like rayon
fat beats they play on want dope rhymes put me on
word is bond you know my steeintro features elijah shabazz from muhammad mosque no 7

peace brother elijah
	hey peace guru how you doin
im maintainin
just been thinkin though man
about the situation for todays youth man the seeds man
whats your opinion on that
	mmm thats strange i was thinkin the same thing
	somethin i read in the holy quran how it says
	has thou seen him who belies religion
	that is one who is rough to the orphan
	and no matter what we say our religion is
	whether its islam christianity
	juddaism buddha-ism old school-ism or new school-ism
	if were not schooling the youth with wisdom
	then the sins of the father will visit the children
	and thats not keepin it real
	thats keepin it -- wrong

chorus guru

now that were gettin somewhere you know we got to give back
for the youth is the future no doubt thats right and exact
squeeze the juice out of all the suckers power
and pour some back out so as to water the flowers
this world is ours thats why the demons are leary
its our inheritance; this is my robbin hood theory robbin hood theory

verse one guru

i seek sun deceive none for each one must teach one
at least one must flow and show the structure of freedom
its me dunn cause petty things we dont need em
lets focus to create somethin great for all that sees them
they innocent they know not what they face
while politicians save face genius minds lay to waste
if i wasnt kickin rhymes id be kickin down doors
creatin social change and defendin the poor
the gods always been militant and ready for war
were gonna snatch up the ringleaders send em home in they drawers
but first wheres the safe at  lets make em show us
and tell em hurry up give up the loot that they owe us
we bringin it back around the way to our peeps
cause times are way too deep we know the code of the streets
meet your defeat; this is my robbin hood theory my robbin hood theory

verse two guru

i floss my rhymes like dentals my mentals presidential
from the wild ghetto districts to the plush resedential
essential would be the message that i send you
i meant to elevate at every venue
pops told me to pursue what is true and nothing other
and nowadays i pave the way for troops of my young brothers
necessary by all means sort of like malcolm
before its too late; i create the best outcome
so i take this opportunity yes to ruin the
devilish forces fuckin up my black community
and we aint doin no more interviews
til we get paid out the frame like motherfuckin donahue
were taking over radio and wack media
cause systematically they gettin greedier and greedier
conquering turfs with my ill organization
takin out the man while we scan the information
you wanna rhyme you best to wait son
you cant even come near if you aint got our share
you front on us this year consider yourself blown out of here
yeah by my robbin hood theory

chorus

verse three guru

it has come to our attention that a mysterious force is loose
somewhere in outer space

	the mysteries of creation are there

		up in the sky	up in the sky

the moon and the planets are there
and new hopes for knowledge and peace are there
and therefore as we set sail; we ask gods blessing --

of which man has ever embarked --&gt; john f kennedy

i self lord and master shall bring disaster to evil factors
demonic chapters shall be captured by kings
through the storms of days after
unto the earth from the sun through triple darkness to blast ya
with a force that cant be compared
to any firepower for its mindpower shared
the brainwake causes vessels to circulate
like constellations reflect at night off the lake
word to the father and mother earth
seeking everlasting life through this hell for what its worth
look listen and observe
and watch another c-cypher pullin my peeps to the curb
heed the words; its like ghetto style proverbs
the righteous pay a sacrifice to get what they deserve
cannot afford to be confined to a cell
brainwaves swell turnin a desert to a well
experience the best teacher; thoughts will spray
like street sweepers little daddy street preacher

and catch a charge shake em down like the riot squad
invade your zone ruin like ancient rome
i span the universe and return to earth to claim my throne
the maker owner plus soul controller
ayatollah rest in the sky the clouds my sofa
stand like collossus regardless to whom or what
numerous attempts at my life so who to trust
who but us to supply you with the fire
the burning truth 150 absolut proof
on the mic like moses spoke in golden scribe
survivor of the oldest tribe whose soldiers died
i notified families we shed tears and more
but our hands are the ammo cause the battles still on
sound the horn; we come rumblin through the function
precise laser beam technique to touch somethin
when we die hard to build the monument to honor us with
humungous effect in the world - we could have conquered it

chorus guru and hannibal

[guru]	while they devise our demise we grow wise
[hann]	upset the set up the element of surprise
[both] itz a set up
[guru]	its time to upset the set up

verse one guru

though they conspire fake us to make us retire
with the burning desire we make it out of the crossfire
thoughts are higher elevating and focused
while the path is narrow for those like us
primo beats provoke us to meditate like zen
with the will and the strength of a million men
while they introspect where nothing is met
its been that way for a while so much has come and then went
but im confident a few are due to redeem
their respective kingdoms with an abundance of cream
so if i were to scheme it would be on a realer dream
like formin effective teams to filter the smokescreens
you totin in jeans dont even know the true envy
the man im pickin apart and plus they both were friends to me
past trivial pursuits like east and west coast feuds
come against me on the mic many and most will lose
like most dudes i love this hip-hop and this rap stuff
but i dont like the shows where the ignorant act up
while somell be rippin it they be in the crowd wildin
flippin on kids for the chains and medallions
or the kid they dont like from a beef from way back
and decide thats the night perfect time for payback
its wack for the group plus the others who came
to see a fat ass show instead theres bullets aflame

chorus

verse two hannibal

still waters run deep this is leagues in depth
quiet as kept they slept we crept
society puts the squeeze on mcs like iron grips of death
from here on in peace and blessings long cherish your breath
gifted and rhyme u now how we do stay true
follow through lay down the law cause its probable and overdue
all systems overdue my guns know me
i only hold a few my nigga for only a few hold me
never forget the ones before me my momma told me
sacrifice for the ones behind me leadin the seeds
blind leads black on black crime to me
inclined to refine my creed i eat thinkin lead
conceive to make the beast bleed enhance thoughts
like tossed trees cross the earth three-fourths
let my offspring feed all three corpus delectis cost me
lost and found on enemy ground quoted although
they dont know how we get down at sound speed we breed
mo more confined to blind greed and self destructive deeds
heed my freedom war cry of course im ny
hug my peeps that died the loved ones alive
reinforce and fly high as i lie so shall i
from new i to cali next plateau universal
unleash the black rain
show em who in control electro-magnetic
pull on the hole ill as toters bang out
til we sittin on swole the strongest way to grow
the only way i know underground railroad on track
no physical or mental chain can shackle that

[answering machine messages]some jamaican gwal
no matta wat we fyace
we mus face de moment of trut baybe

chorus guru
they say its lonely at the top in whatever you do
you always gotta watch motherfuckers around you
nobodys invincible no plan is foolproof
we all must meet our moment of truth

verse one guru
the same sheisty cats that you hang with and do your thang with
could set you up and wet you up nigga peep the language
its universal you play with fire it may hurt you
or burn you lessons are blessings you should learn through
lets face facts although mcs lace tracks
it doesnt mean behind the scenes there aint no dirt to trace back
that goes for all of us there aint nobody to trust
its like sabotage its got me ready to bust
but i cant jeapordize what i have done up to this point
so ima get more guys to help me run the whole joint
cultivate multiply motivate or else well die
you know i be the masterof the who what where and why
see when youre shinin some chumpsll wanna dull ya
always selfish jealous punks will wanna pull ya
down just like some shellfish in a bucket
cause they love it to see your ass squirm like a worm
but just as youll receive what is comin to you
everybody else is gonna get theirs too
i aint no saint therefore i cannot dispute
that everyone must meet their moment of truth

chorus guru
actions have reactions dont be quick to judge
you may not know the hardships people dont speak of
its best to step back and observe with couth
for we all must meet our moment of truth

verse two guru
sometimes you gotta dig deep when problems come near
dont fear things get severe for everybody everywhere
why do bad things happen to good people
seems that life is just a constant war between good and evil
the situation that im facin is mad amazin
to think such problems can arise from minor confrontations
now im contemplatin in my bedroom pacin
dark clouds over my head my hearts racin
suicide nah im not a foolish guy
dont even feel like drinking or even gettin high
cause all thats gonna do really is accelerate
the anxieties that i wish i could alleviate
but wait ive been through a whole lot of other shit before
so i oughta be able to withstand some more
but im sweatin though my eyes are turnin red and yo
im ready to lose my mind but instead i use my mind
i put down the knife and take the bullets out my nine
my only crime was that im too damn kind
and now some scandalous motherfuckers wanna take whats mine
but they cant take the respect that ive earned in my lifetime
and you know theyll never stop the furious force of my rhymes
so like they say every dog has its day
and like they say god works in a mysterious way
so i pray remembering the days of my youth
as i prepare to meet my moment of truth
you should know the truth
and the truth shall set you free -- from  whos gonna take the
weight 

verse three guru
yo i got one lyric pointed at your head for start
another one is pointed at your weak ass heart
now if i pull the trigger on these fully loaded lines
youre gonna wish i woulda pulled a black nine i mack dimes
crack the spines of the fake gangsters
yeah the bitin triflin niggaz and the studio pranksters
yo lookin at the situation plainly will you remain g
or will you be looked upon strangely
i reign as the articulator with the greater data
revolvin on the tascam much doper than my last jam
while others struggle to juggle tricky metaphors
i explore more to expose the core
a lot of mcs act stupid to me
and we have yet to see if they can match our longevity
but anyway its just another day
another fake jack i slay with my spectac rap display
styles smooth but rugged -- you cant push or shove it
you dig it and you dug it cause like money you love it
the king of monotone with my own throne
righteously violent prone my words bring winds like cyclones
stormin your hideout blockin out your sunlight
your image and your business were truly not done right
throw up your he-allah-i now divine saviors
you got no hand skills theres no security to save ya
no pager no celly no drop top benz-y
i came to bring your phony hip-hop to an ending
my art of war will leave you sore from the abuse
cause you must meet your moment of truth

chorus guru
they say its lonely at the top in whatever you do
you always gotta watch motherfuckers around you
nobodys invincible no plan is foolproof
we all must meet our moment of truth*gangstarrs whos gonna take the weight plays in the background*

verse one big shug

ive been known to instill fear
although the world may be round we still trapped in the square
city light got me buggin and trife
some die by the gun some die by the knife
its alright like a game of spades im trump tight
premier hit me with music to ensure that it thump right
and my flight will be taken solely at night
cause thats when the freaks come out no doubt
and in the dark hours is when i will shower
with the knowledge of my trade to get paid
still i make moves like a snake in the grass roundabout
i be dickin it down while you be assed out
puff mad ls but never passed out

chorus

verse two guru

yo; i aint one to succumb to no man but to command
and scoop up the troops when its time to take a stand
emphatically deep strategies leave casualties
i creep gradually til everybody knows
that i got more flows than rosebud got hoes
the anger inside had me trapped
til i got geared up with raps to tear you up like big gats
for big stacks watch your back when i send em in
caught you tremblin my name and face youre rememberin
several attempts but nah bitch youll never win
rhymes pierce your skin or maybe limbs well be severin
take you to the mat peep that you should keep back
my ill-kid format will lay you flat like a doormat
that i walk on i meditate while you talk on
and gossip so i drop my hot shit; fully loaded glock clips
so get the fuck out my block kid
as nights turn to days days go back to nights we be speaking it right
and keeping it tight up in the street life
i meet life head on no holds barred
born with a heart of gold now mostly cold and scarred
en guard choose your weapon or get to steppin
lyrical bullets make you dance from the trance you be kept in
assessments are made before and during combat
i master my hunger blow the spot when i bomb cats
one of us equals many of us
disrespect one of us youll see plenty of us
conflict is what i predict
you and your fellas is mad jealous attempting to flare
we cleverly stalked ya your famll miss ya
the wars on thats why we formed the militia

chorus

verse three freddie foxxx

you niggaz owe me for my rhymes i come to collect
for you dope fiend niggaz in rap i here to inject check
my style is butter baby spread it around
but when you niggaz dont flow it right and fuck up my sound
i get down; in 89 i spit the buck in the face
of every mc that came in the place a scar youll never erase
mcs are only recognized for their flows
im worldwide for the bitches that i turned into hoes
you heard me spit it on jew-elz thats how it goes
for all them faking ass niggaz and how i bust up they nose
and while your nose is drippin and drainin blood
i be standing over you screamin nigga what what nigga what
niggas feel my presence like im right in they palm
cause a stormy day is coming when you see me so calm its on
no more twin glocks they jam up my plays
now its twin 40 calibre walther ppks
im in the control of my game you must respect me like the ref
uh-huh you disrespect *gun clicks* you get the tech
i turn you fake niggaz on and off like im the clapper
i rob so many niggaz they should call me jack the rapper
ill the illest nigga doing this dead or alive
gloria gaynor on you motherfuckers i will survive
you can try to come at me but do you want the kick back
you snap inside the cage of a pit and you get bit back huh
my war is so tight my drama so ill
beef with me hangs around like a unpaid bill
i push these lyrics through any mc and make it burn
so the niggaz who be rhyming next will miss a turn
when you speak of whos the dopest mc i dont come up
but when you speak of whos the livest mc i stay what up whats up
i got stripes while you got strikes and bogus mikes
do what bitch niggaz do best *utfo sample* bite
you niggaz cant make up a law that i dont overrule overthrow
prim brought bumpy these tracks so i can let you know
before i slide ima leave you this jewel
even mechanics walk around with they tools
its the militiayou do your first bid and dirt to get your name known
you never talk too much to get your spot blown
now youre no longer just a face in the crowd
youre gettin so much respect that niggaz might as well bow
and movin up with your hustle like you planned it
rakin dough like the worlds greatest bandit
always got one eye open for the stick-up kids postin
so much cream chumps they cant understand it
ladies flock to your jock like its golden
curious to test the weight you be holdin
but you aint got no time to be chasin felines
if shes the chick that you pick then she gets chosen
people treat you like youre ghetto royalty
and all your staff shows you utmost loyalty
you paid your dues refuse to lose in this scenario
the rep grows bigga youre a legend and a hero

your fame has gotten larger than your life
youve got a harem of bitches and killer niggaz thats hype
they got your back but you so fly you dont need em
you shit what youre eatin so you dont peep the proceedings
they start schemeing feeling that youre too swollen
and thats the reason why your cash and stash gets stolen
you start perspiring because youre paranoid
still another confrontation that you couldnt avoid
prepare for drama as if you were a stunt man
back in the days you was a forty and a blunt man
today youre a willie now the weathers too chilly
new york city aint the place to be frontin
over your shoulders day and nights where you look
your so-called fam ran a scam and you got shook
go back to square one better go talk to your son
see reps grow bigga in the life of a crook

years ago we were new jacks to this scene
showed some effort made fat records but still saw no green
know what i mean  they tried to stifle us
nigga you could not believe how really ill and trife it was
fed up so we headed on a serious mission
wishin that we could better our position
two businessmen guru and prim we enterprised
too strong to be stepped on creatively wise
the dedicated ministers of underground sound
when were doin our thing you know we dont fuck around
no matter how bizarre and different you think you are
your team wouldnt dream of competeing with gangstarr
premier in the rear with the beats and cuts
and guru with the mic ready to tear shit up
take us out the game nigga  how you figure
the name is well kept and the rep just gets biggatell the people what youre here for

intro/chorus guru

its the message in the song that makes you rock on
some people go to places where they dont belong
whether wrong or right a lot of people fight
but im here to bless this mic aight

verse one guru

i take action the minute that the crowd gets hype
im type crashin down like a meteorite
im bogart-ing mics and whole stages
destroying mcs dreams from words to whole pages
their rapbooks look more like scrapbooks
with their fictional fairytales and frail ass hooks
a lot of shit has happened since i started rappin
theres been enough beef and enough gat clappin
theres been mad signs for this brother to heed
and while some choose greed i choose to plant seeds
for your mental spirit and physical temple
bob your head to it theres the water youve been lead to it
bathe in it a long time youve been cravin it
prance to it use your third eye and glance through it
your state of being becoming advanced through it
while others rhyme with no reason i be breezin
their mics i seize them then i try em for treason
i used to always like to hang out
now i lounge in the rest writin bombs while tracks bang out
i know you peeped me in the club then
but now im in your speaker with the voice that youre lovin

chorus

verse two guru

peace to the young ladies who wanna bone me much
and peace to my nigga premier with the golden touch
i never fall off point like deniro in casino
peace to black gambinos and all my peoples
dig the steelo -- im fightin wars you know
as in the jihad most humble most merciful
thats because i be god i trog through fogs puffing logs
mcs muttering menial madness they get mobbed
scarred and barred and then banished from my fuckin kingdom
you got a fly one bring one or else i come to fling some
exquisite exotic exciting type shit
enough to make the real heads wake up and get hype quick
im type slick known as the god universal
kick rhymes without rehearsal i cross the burnin sands
now i stand here with virtue of course i could hurt you
simply with my point of view and i knew
that many would come thats why ive chosen
to cut off pathways and theres no runways or doorways open
for the jokers who aint focused
and all the fake mercenaries get buried by the tongue of terrifying fury
nothings blurry fuck it i got no worries
hearts and minds shine bright light with insight
yeah sense my birthright to set up cyphers with power
cause mad shit aint right like punks in the spotlight
who cant freestyle sometimes i make my peeps smile
by sayin somethin crazy wild
like some shit off my dome that be soundin
better than the next mans whole albumthis jam is dedicated
to that woman that knows what she wants
and just how to get it word up

she knows what she wants 2x
yo she knows what she wants
she knows what she wants and just how to get it

she knows what she wants
yeah she knows what she wants
she knows what she wants
she knows what she wants and just how to get it

she knows what she wants shes bold so she flaunts
her hourglass jewels to mad clientele
rejected oh well she aint goin to no hotel
not the frantic freak type but if you speak right
you get to take her out and dig her out on a weeknight
weekends she wants to spend your ends
her shopping spree is colossal attitude semi-hostile
mack diva senorita no reefer no pizza just
shrimp and lobsters champagne and mobsters
suckin up the cream like a vac to a carpet
strictly black market now youre her next target
watch out cause yo she knows what she wants

she knows what she wants 2x
yo she knows what she wants
she knows what she wants and just how to get it

spotted her in the club with her crew nearby
her looks are a lullaby to pass us by shes too fly
never gunshy hair is blown dry
she craves a wiseguy to help her gain amplify
so when you say yo baby she aint gotta say hi to ya
cause prior to this he put rocks on her neck and wrist
plus a fat joint on her finger
you best to have a batch of scratch and treats to bring her
and if you happen to luck up and get in
youll find yourself another jealous trick-ass boyfriend
and furthermore the mink shes donning is stunning
blinding your senses dunn never put the two
before the one son

	its the lesson well learned

		its going down

	*scratched*	its the lesson well learned

		its going down

she knows what she wants 2x
yo she knows what she wants
yeah she knows what she wants and just how to get it

never fall victim to a chicken you was stickin
even if you think the punanny might be finger-lickin
never fall victim to a wicked womans ways
why son  shes trying to get paid check it
one she said she wanted to give me a son
two she said she didnt like my crew
three she never ever cooked for me
four she was my cheri amore -- yeah right
it was all hype i needed more insight
in retrospect i know i slept from the first night
she did a split and that was it
gave up my pimp license and flipped my whole friggin script
but now im back like the isleys moving wisely
sizing up the situation keeping honies waiting
cause i got more to do than to be sucked dry
this tough guy will get by while the chickens wonder why
i dont be callin cause its like ex to next kid
i know what i want and just how to get it
like her no disrespect missfrom new york straight talk americas best 3xyo yo gu-rizzi yofeat krumb snatcha

guru
first and foremost some rappers are sweet like fructose
when i cock back these lyrics yall punks best be ghost
i be the seven twenty-one eighteen twenty-one
the illest one im almost doper than anyone
straight out the late nights of bed-stuy
steppin up yall put your weapons up i make heads fly
youre artificial like saccarhin
youre crazy fake its more than skills you be lackin in
concepts you bite cause your identity aint tight
tryin to be somethin youre not like pullin a knife at a gunfight
im troopin on night air like flight number 106
and gettin all up in your fuckin mix
you get me upset and i got you uptight
cause my committees in your city tonight aight
we got seventeen million of us plus two million indians
that makes 19 mil lightin shit up like wild bill
i be the supreme father plus the ill kid with drama
my karma creates the teflon to pierce your body armor
and make sure you check the shit before you walk to me or talk to me
steppin to me improperly you just may catch the weaponry
my specialty is tearin tracks out the frame
you know my fuckin name i rule all game
im universal on all planes whats your claim

guru
yo i be your highness in slickness you chumps bear witness
tremendous tropper verbal nigga witht he fitness
drop you for your spot with the blazer then i blast ya
slice precise like fenny hanas when i come to bring the dramas
styles so swift that you cant peep the god
as your lyrics get buried six feet deep in my backyard
i laugh hard while your mental i run through mazes
dark stages of terror to shatter your dressing room mirror
your whole error gets crushed your whole show gets bumrushed
too many dumb punks want to enter this rap scene
kickin willie bobo but need to be slapped clean
into oblivion the true champion always rises
i bring surprises to the chief plus their advisers
size me up and you will find nothings larger
catch more wreck on your dome than a deranged fuckin barber
so what you made some dough you best keep on scramblin
all your vanity is instantly crushed when i start handlin
demandin that you pay for your weak rhyme display
coast to coast i break the fakes everyday

krumb snatcha
i see myself as the black rap messiah
colossal spreadin my gospel through electrical wires
spit fire through speech so i can reach each and every
tom dick and jerry slippin like petroleum jelly
too busy in the limelight cant rhyme tight
i got divine right to bring yall to light
somethin aint right to be an mc you gotta thug
or to thug you gotta be an mc this shit is bugged
show love but few; deal with crew and crew only
and think universal like sony
phony pounds and fake hugs is usually avoided
give a fuck like pizza hut i got to stay noyd-ed
cause that same nigga you trust could be that same cat
behind that gat that bust quiet ya with the silencer
keep it hush ashes to dust then dust to ashes
nowadays its who pull out the fastest imagine this
rap shit without this gat shit or the phony cat
in black talkin bout how much his mac spit
but this year gangstarr got changes bein made
no wack shit bein played no fake macks gettin paid
no versace mcs with a mouth full of mo
soundin like a hoe spittin that old-fashioned show flow
i bombshell that pastel chanel rap through a maxwell
ever since young krumb was taught to rap well
goin deep process of thought when my eyes closes
awaken with interpretive robe and sandals like moses
travellin high sands and eastern lands for the answers
ignorance is spreadin through the streets like it was cancer
too many drinkin not thinkin when behind that trigger
a 38 escalate the murder rate for us niggaz
its like microphone roulette cause nowadays mcs is gettin wet
over someone elses fake gangsta repfeat g-dep and shiggy sha

she wanted me to knock her in the back of foot locker
i chuckled as she kicked more game than soccer

baseball cap bent the fresh scent is issey miyake
all the way from green acres to the beverly center
heads turn and im the main concern when i enter
at albee square niggaz wouldnt even dare
with that fake thuggish ruggish when them brooklyn kids be in there
saw newriqi l and then a sweet for my girl

scandalous money greed and lust
in this trife life there aint nobody you can trust
plus theres no justice its just us
in fact watchin yo back it be must
and each and everyday around the way gats bust
and jealous so-called friendsll try to set you up
its called betrayal

verse 1 guru

check the horror scene
the kid was like twelve or thirteen
never had the chance like other kids to follow dreams
watched his father catch two in the dome and to the spleen
nothin but blood everywhere these streets are mean
they spared his life but killed his moms and his sister jean
of course over some drug shit
his pops was on some ill-out spill your guts on some thug shit
didnt know his boys was on some shady ass no love shit
his pops got played out though with silencers they laid him out yo
took his stash and all the cash and left em tied up on the couch yo
with tape over his mouth so he couldnt cry out
cause his dad was the nigga with clout
survival of the fittest so they split his wig no doubt
despite the stocking caps he noticed the same cat who used to give him doe
and taught him to use the same gat
supposed to be an unclefam and all that
he could tell it was him cause he wore the same slacks he wore when
he took him to meadowlands racetrack
why did he flip and go out like that
its called betrayal

hook

verse 2 scarface

a betrayal
punk ass niggas
its called betrayal

he on a mission to become a ball player
flip big benzs flossin all gators
had it all mapped out6-812th grader
fresh outta school he filn to go lay paper
he had a brother who was hustlin collection his change
never let his baby brother stick his neck in the game
told him all he had to do is just enjoy the ride
and he aint have to worry about money cause thats in time
so now hes pacin as the time moves slowly
cant wait to face shaquille in the paint and school kobe
kept his grades and stayed up under neighborhood functions
and then a group of knuckleheads came through dumpin
so now hes sittin on the sidewalk bleedin
fell into a puddle of his own blood and stopped breathin
and everybody in the neighborhood still grievin
but destiny caught up with his ass and he got even
and all the cryin in the world aint goin to bring him back
his brother sittin at the wake wipin tears from his mothers eyes
whyd the game have to go and take the young boys life
only the wicked live shife payin the price
while hes starin at the shell
his brothers soul wants hell the trigger man made bail
and you wouldnt pay the boys mail and sacrificed the fuckin family
thats betrayal

stupid you know its time to sit and think before we hit the brink
lockerroom at a prize fight before he hit the ring
like when i tell these corporate leeches they cant get a thing
or when i tell relentless rappers they had better sing
the position that anyone holds could be up to grabs
im waitin up the ave to see if anyone folds
since i was twenty-one years old and legal
i knew the difference between gimmicky gangsters and powerful people
im the reason why the game is flipped
im the reason why your aim is missed
im the reason why youre mad i only sprained my wrist
the reason my mindframe is trained in this
you like gunfire  better acquire the taste
cuz youf walk aroun with full pounds by dem waist
deface property they be laced properly

verse three krumbsnatcha

like when to talk when to spark and when not to speak
i do the one before a gun come out
plus yall dont really wanna see krumb dumb out
a ghetto doctrine to watch every pistol pop
and then while you watchin examine all options
young bodies in the coffin more often
it stay the same from brooklyn to boston
every interstate more youth with the inner hate
deep in the struggle puttin food on they dinner plate
hungry wolves that roll thick in packs
and pray on you cats with the gangstafied raps
extortion only gettin left with abortion
pullin out tools on them fools who be flossin

out the window every night deadly intentions man
cocked back and ready to fire hit man for hire
and fuck politicians nothin but liars
as i build my cream with self esteem
but drink the water from the streams of gangsta lean
to keep food on my plate stick a mac to your face
so i never have to fall off so you can never underrate
force pressure is the techniques of real men
so when you slam the doors we still get in
its like demons when what you fight that you cant seell
come out your buildin and get shot drastically
the way of the world niggaz fiendin to pull it
you either bite the dust or just dodge that bulletdj premier scratching

verse one guru
the names have been changed to protect the innocent
each step is intricate i rep magnificent
knew this kid named ronnie used to make cash with caesar
they made a lot of money back in the 80s crack fever
caesar was an overachiever a kingpin and 18-and-a-half
he got knocked and left ronnie to watch the team and the stash
plus his crib his jewels his whip and his girl
and ronnies self-interests had him livin in a different world
he rocked caesars chains he put caesars rings
smokin mad wools all day with caesars change
not to mention he pushed up on caesars wifey
a move like that my man extremely sheisty
it all got back to caesar in the bing
they found ronnies body in the playground by the swings
anyone can get it for sure it dont matter dawg
especially when a nigga tries commitin sabotage

when you think that they be breddern they underhand your plan
its over for the cowardly we grow more potent hourly

dissension can occur from within ones ranks
the chain can be weakened by just one link
pricks be galavantin from one crew to the next
musical click-ass niggaz catch two to the chest
my usual guess is that they chose to digress
disillusioned by greed causin you to distress
just do whats best clean house leave out
them punks cant touch what they cant peep out
see im a raw nigga and like my pops im a lawgiver
cant throw a wrench in my game im a boss figure
take you under my wing it dont matter god
dead you if you try to commit sabotage
rise for me now kneel for me now

the emotions that one goes thourgh over a loss of a loved one
or friend then knowing the cost of rebuilding and carrying on
it gets so damn hard in this modern day babylon
and disease runs rampant so many men carry arm
so many have a lonely painful road to travel on
mothers losing sons improper use of guns
children go astray because their parents were abusive ones
i used to run with the illest guys
thourgh the realest eyes
i seen the realest and the illest die
the cycle continues so many times the good ones
the young ones
so many misunderstood ones
remembering their faces and voices
and when the wise man said
life is full of choices
some get caught up others are innocent victims
all i know is they were close to us and that we miss them

the brother who must live and give with much insight
foresight to ignite excite and delight
and you might gain from it or feel pain from it
because im ultimate and im about to let off
knowledge is wisdom understanding
truths the proof so wont you throw a hand
in the air put up a peace sign and be fine
if so were feeling good we should we could we would
stop think for a moment ok

hoped to be dope as me id you flee

superficial and i wish you would give it a rest
but if you dont ill unsheath my excalibur
like a noble knight so meet ya challenger

gettin beat to a pulp so that you cant run for help
i heard a gulp in your throat cause you hope that ill be merciful
but coo-cluck i made you strut as i rehearse a few
battle drills and watch your bladder spill

face to feet to defeat you can tell im into it

match-up makes gangstarr wanna snatch up
one or two phrases from the new book with new pages
of rhymes that are built like a chariot
dope vocals carry it to the battle set
if a beat was a princess i would marry it
but now i must bow to the crowd as i stand proud
victorius glorious understand now
cause battles and wars and much fights i have been through
one mc got beheaded and you can too
forget it cause youd rather be just a spectator
an onlooker afraid you may get slayed or
struck by a blow from a mic gladiator
i betcha that later you might be sad that you played yourself
cause you stepped up chest puffed out
and in just one lyric you got snuffed out
cause rhymin is serious im strong im like hercules
youll get hurt with these lines close the curtains please
and suckers can jet cause i wreck once you step in the arena

{dj premier cuts the phrase step inside my arena over and over}

guru
in the arena or forum weak mcs i will floor em
causin mayhem ill slay them and the bloodll be pourin
furthermore i implore that as a soldier of war
i go in only to win and be the holder of more
trophies titles and triumphs cause i dump all the sly chumps
never choosin to lose my spot not once
for the mere idea of an opponent that i fear
is foolish utterly i mean but nonell be
tryin to toy wit a destroyer of many
you shitted your pants cause you cant figure any
foe that can step to this concept so
tou better sit again citizen weak mcs i get rid of them
watch the way they get distraught when they get caught
in the worst positions cause they didnt listen
and tried goin up against a hungry killer whos itchin
to mame and murder those who claimed that they were the
toughest ones they get done once they step in the arena

verse one guru
stupid you know its time to sit and think before we hit the brink
lockerroom at a prize fight before he hit the ring
like when i tell these corporate leeches they cant get a thing
or when i tell relentless rappers they had better sing
the position that anyone holds could be up to grabs
im waitin up the ave to see if anyone folds
since i was twenty-one years old and legal
i knew the difference between gimmicky gangsters and powerful people
im the reason why the game is flipped
im the reason why your aim is missed
im the reason why youre mad i only sprained my wrist
the reason my mindframe is trained in this
you like gunfire  better acquire the taste
cuz youf walk aroun with full pounds by dem waist
deface property they be laced properly
rules are rules fools are fools i react logically

a ghetto doctrine to watch every pistol pop
and then while you watchin examine all options
young bodies in the coffin more often

deep in the struggle puttin food on they dinner plate
hungry wolves that roll thick in packs
and pray on you cats with the gangstafied raps
extortion only gettin left with abortion

you know i used to be a player fly girl layer and a heartbreaker
lovemaker backbreaker but then i made a
mistake yes i fell in love with this ill chick
sweatin me for money my name and the dilsnick
my homeboys told me to drop her for it would be to my benefit
she used to say id better quit hanging with those derelects
romancing is my thing but i cant swing with no scheming hoes
wherever my beema goes you know that im driving
surviving in the 90s is a must so i trust
that everyone listen up as my vocals give thrust
i bust my rhymes first never chasing a skirt
do much work while other suckas need more time to rehearse
now back to the ex-girls ex-lovers ex-friends
it made me mad to find that she was only after my ends
she phones me and goes on about her new life now
i wish she knew right now
i think shes busted lets discuss it
when i was with her no trust just fights
just the he-say-she-say and the neighborhood highlights
bow i got my new girl or as i say my baby doll
but im still gettin crazy calls my ex-girls got balls
dont wanna play the field cuz i get lovin at home base
dont gimme no long face just exit with a grace
you and i are the past cest la vie much respect girl
but now youre my ex-girl cuz im on with the next girl

chorus

&lt;cuz girls look so good&gt;

verse two

she had much loot liked to buy me fresh-dipped gear
liked to have me near cuz of my svoir faire
the time we shared was brief cuz i needed relief
from her high-classed antics and all her conceit
now shes crying wolf and i like dont wanna hear that
i told her the bear facts when things started out
she wines and she pouts about how i did her bad
yo but shed tried to buy me
even tempt me with the hiney
i fell for a sec cuz the clothes were real fly
i could almost feel i
would give into her whims
her thoughts were erratic sporadic crazy in nature
i told her hey look i can no longer date ya
tried to pimp with bank and fell short your ship sank
many thanks for the time and the watch and the link
you and i are the past cest la vie nuff respect girl
but now youre my ex-girl cuz im straight with the next girl

chorus

verse three

you saw my mom in the supermarket and gave her your number
you asked hows my sister then asked hows my brother
didnt ask about my father cuz you know he aint like ya
every time i left for your crib yo hed really get hyper
the advice he used to give me makes much sense now
i cant believe i used to let you break my confidence down
you used to ask me why the hell did i wanna live in brooklyn
you messed up my flow although you were good-lookin
yes darlin was fly and this was the problem
cuz back in the day she had me scheming and robbin
to get her things to wear so when she went to the club
all eyes were on her and me i just bugged
caught in between felling proud and feeling more like a sucker
had to go undercover get away find another
been in brooklyn 9 years and been around the world too
ive seen so many fly girls and i knew just what to do
i went from ex-girl to next took my time with each one
and you know they still love me so stop jellin me hon
went home to see mom and i saw you at the bus stop
must i stop nah i think not
you and i are the past cest la vie much respect girl
but now youre my ex-girl &amp; im out with the next girl
out

chorusfive carloads deep time to go do a show
got a massive crew and were ready to roll so
i grab my gear hop in the whip and ride
premier hes got the fly dope system inside
but my shit cranks too and weve got mad tapes
of all the underground groups with the lyrics and bass
off into the new york night we go
dre large got the camera biggest gords got three rolls of film
so we can take the macked out photos
tommy hill the damaja and my man gusmo
corey and smurf and lil daps got a forty
my man gary and shiz and the nutcracker shorty
mike rone chillin like capone
robinhood known as mel with the clientele
mo jt mega and cant forget black
big rob and sincere yes the posses fat
outloud pulls up plus theres sid and oc
big mel from strong island hl the one and only
odelicious eli bazz and eon
and the aroma of the blunts has me thinking beyond
and to the rest of the crew you know the bond is strong
and you know whos who so let me not prolong
for this was a night to remember
i had on the beige tims with the two-tone leather
so we get to the jam the gig the venue
then we circled around and then drove in through
the front - the place was packed the line was long
i was bobbing my head cause the music was on
i turned it down then i peeped to my right
i saw this kid and his girl having a fight
another kid walked up and mushed the kid in his face
and then the kid pulled out and bust him and laid him to waste
a riot broke out girls screaming and scheming crews
started buck wiling tryna snatch kids jewels
after that 5-0 came and turned the party out
and then the ambulance came to take the body out
and we didnt even get all the equipment out
and we didnt even get to turn the place out
this can happen often and its really fucked up
so ill ask you to your face homeboy whats up
did you come to see my show or to the stupid nigga playoffs
killing you and killing me its the soliloquy of chaos

and if you live in cities where the streets reek warfare
people getting nowhere but you go for yours there
youll find it doesnt pay to front or play the role
you could get stole or maybe beat with a pole
then youll wanna retaliate regroup and come back
so you set the brothers up for a sneak attack
whether you die or kill them its another brother dead
but i know youll never get that through your head
cause were mislead and misfed facts were way off
killing you and killing me its the soliloquy of chaosfeat big shug &amp; freddie foxxx

city light got me buggin and trife
some die by the gun some die by the knife
its alright like a game of spades im trump tight
premier hit me with music to ensure that it thump right
and my flight will be taken solely at night
cause thats when the freaks come out no doubt
and in the dark hours is when i will shower
with the knowledge of my trade to get paid
still i make moves like a snake in the grass roundabout
i be dickin it down while you be assed out
puff mad ls but never passed out
and if im caught up in a jam i blast my way out

verse two guru

yo; i aint one to succumb to no man but to command
and scoop up the troops when its time to take a stand
emphatically deep strategies leave casualties
i creep gradually til everybody knows
that i got more flows than rosebud got hoes
the anger inside had me trapped
til i got geared up with raps to tear you up like big gats
for big stacks watch your back when i send em in
caught you tremblin my name and face youre rememberin
several attempts but nah bitch youll never win
rhymes pierce your skin or maybe limbs well be severin
take you to the mat peep that you should keep back
my ill-kid format will lay you flat like a doormat
that i walk on i meditate while you talk on
and gossip so i drop my hot shit; fully loaded glock clips
so get the fuck out my block kid
as nights turn to days days go back to nights we be speaking it right
and keeping it tight up in the street life
i meet life head on no holds barred
born with a heart of gold now mostly cold and scarred
en guard choose your weapon or get to steppin
lyrical bullets make you dance from the trance you be kept in
assessments are made before and during combat
i master my hunger blow the spot when i bomb cats
one of us equals many of us
disrespect one of us youll see plenty of us
conflict is what i predict
you and your fellas is mad jealous attempting to flare
we cleverly stalked ya your famll miss ya
the wars on thats why we formed the militia

you niggaz owe me for my rhymes i come to collect
for you dope fiend niggaz in rap i here to inject check
my style is butter baby spread it around
but when you niggaz dont flow it right and fuck up my sound
i get down; in 89 i spit the buck in the face
of every mc that came in the place a scar youll never erase
mcs are only recognized for their flows
im worldwide for the bitches that i turned into hoes
you heard me spit it on jew-elz thats how it goes
for all them faking ass niggaz and how i bust up they nose
and while your nose is drippin and drainin blood
i be standing over you screamin nigga what what nigga what
niggas feel my presence like im right in they palm
cause a stormy day is coming when you see me so calm its on
no more twin glocks they jam up my plays
now its twin 40 calibre walther ppks
im in the control of my game you must respect me like the ref
uh-huh you disrespect *gun clicks* you get the tech
i turn you fake niggaz on and off like im the clapper
i rob so many niggaz they should call me jack the rapper
ill the illest nigga doing this dead or alive
gloria gaynor on you motherfuckers i will survive
you can try to come at me but do you want the kick back
you snap inside the cage of a pit and you get bit back huh
my war is so tight my drama so ill
beef with me hangs around like a unpaid bill
i push these lyrics through any mc and make it burn
so the niggaz who be rhyming next will miss a turn
when you speak of whos the dopest mc i dont come up
but when you speak of whos the livest mc i stay what up whats up
i got stripes while you got strikes and bogus mikes
do what bitch niggaz do best *utfo sample* bite
you niggaz cant make up a law that i dont overrule overthrow

then she started bringing up past things and she kept asking
how come our love isnt lasting
i said hey baby please calm down cuz im still around
and its for you that my heart pounds
can i call you later on you say i treat you wrong
but why you flippin on me
she said something else and then click
left me alone on the phone with the tone
and now im lovesick

relationships can grip with the pain
arguments in the crib in the streets on the train
im crazy fed but then still
when she aint there i feel sad i feel ill
frowning cuz im down in the dumps
the other night i took her out so she could shake her rump
but after we were there for a few
some girls that i knew stepped up and asked me to come to
a party they were havin at their house
i looked at my girl and yo she started walkin out
i said hey love just wait for a second
and wont you just check it its all a part of makin records
those were just some friends in the business
no need to get angry so listen up while i kick this
and what about the things we discussed
about havin trust whats all this attitude stuff
now hon you know that i wouldnt play you
but time after time you let your jealousy sway you
hey dont you turn your back like that
come on this is wack youre heated up like a thermostat
then she stepped off in a whirlwind and i dont know when
or if im gonna see her again
i coulda sworn she was the right one to pick
but nowman im just lovesicki never thought that you would crab me
undermine me and backstab me
but i can see clearly now the rain is gone
the pain is gone but what you did was still wrong
there was a few times i needed your support
but you tried to play me like an indoor sport
like racquetball tennis pool whatever
all i know is you attempted to be clever
nevertheless cleverness cant impress
cause now youve been expose like a person undressed
cause i see through you im the guru
now what you gonna do when i step to you
and when i pay you back ill be hurting you
this aint no threat so take it personal

rap is an art you cant own no loops
its how you hook em up and the rhyme style troop
so dont even think you could say someone bit
off your weak beat come on you need to quit
i flip lines and rhymes that never sound like yours
there oughtta be laws against you yapping your jaws
originality overflows from in me
and the truth is that you wish you could live the
life i live and kick the lyrics i kick
but bear in mind that you cant think as quick
so premier drops a beat for me to say verses to
and if i sound doper then take it personal

dont be mad cause i dont come around the way
like i used to i dont have time these days
im keeping busy making power moves
dont try to say i dont remember you
you shouldnt let your jealousy show like that
i stopped coming by cause of the way you act
telling my business to kids i dont even know
youre like a daytime talk show and thats low
so you can tell everyone that im jerking you
and if you dont like it kid take it personalguru

yo duke youre dead wrong
youll never have the skills like mine
i write the ill type rhymes
now im reaching my prime
360 dunk in your face
you cant compete youre just a basketcase
lets separate the men from the boys
and put your money where your mouth is
no time for toys
your game is weak get it so dont sleep
cuz ill be checking and wrecking ya
when i start to creep 
through the backdoor
i know i caught you out there 
you got no clout here
and i doubt there
is anyway that you can stop the beatdown
you better play the background
and sit back down 
chumps like you i gotta keepem in line
so prepare to suffer boy cuz now youre mine

dj premier scratching

dj premier scratchingstick up kids is out to tax x2
and this is how the story goes

brothers are amused by others brothers reps
but the thing they know best is where the gun is kept
cause in the night youll feel fright
and at the sight of a 4-5th i guess you just might
wanna do a da or two
cause they could maybe bust you for self or wit a crew
no matter is you or your brothers a star
he could pop you in and jet without a getaway car
and some might say that hes a dummy
but hes sticking you and taking all of your money
its a daily operation
he might be loose in the park or lurking at the train station
mad brothers know his name
so he thinks he got a little fame
from the stick-up game
and while were blaming society
hes at a party with his man
they got their eye on the gold chain
that the next mans wearing
it looks big but they aint staring
just thinking of a way and when to get the brother
theyll be long gone before the kid recovers
and back around the way hell have the chain on his neck
claimin respect just to get a rep

ten brothers in a circle
had the kid trapped the one wit the hood he said well hurt you
if you dont run out your dues and pay
give up the rolex watch or you wont see another day
see they were on the attack
and one said yo you wanna make this to a homicide rap
make it fast so we can be on our way
kick in the rings and everything ok
the kid was nervous and flinching
and little shorty with the 3-8 yo he was inchin
closer and closer put the gun to his head
shorty was down to catch a body instead
money was scared so he panicked
took off his link and his rings and ran frantic 
but shorty said now pulled the trigger and stepped
it was nothing he did it just to get a rep

the rep goes bigger and now hes known for his trigger finger
rolling with troops of the sons like a gangster figure
hes near the peak of his crazy career
his posses a nightmare macking jewls and some crazy gear
but as we know these things do come back
and shortys now peeping others that are scheming the kind of act
cuz the kid that got shot didnt perish so
he pulls up in a jeep with tinted window
too late shorty was caught in the mix
his time ran out his number came up and thats it
ya know the rest so dont front the plan has been upset
some brothers gotta go out just to get a repim like a sniper rhymesll strike ya when im rockin
mad chicks be jockin when the g starrs talking
and thats because my word is bond
i get much fan mail and i always respond
so tell your hon to write me too
make sure she puts attention mr guru
brothers know the flow is unique
i got 100 wild styles in my black valise
mcs wanna be me so they keep askin
for me to teach em methods both slow and fast
and others wanna act as if theyre better
but they only got one style which aint all that clever
im cooler than wind harder than cold steel
i get the ladies with more than just sex appeal
a mystic psychic scanning all your thoughts
ill touch your soul and make your brain feel caught
when my rapture traps ya and makes you mine
youll submit to the gift and to the lyrical lines
so suckers realize that the size is too large
when i come through im pullin whole crews cards
i be wreckin correct and on the gang starr tip
mcs who front imma gonna bust your shit

i wonder do you love it enough
im steppin rugged and tough never to front or to bluff
i got the fresh cut baldy the brothers call me
guru the man yes with all the
j-a-z-z-y type essence street type lessons manifesting
the one who make the fly ladies feel pleasant
never forgettin that to myself im true
do what you want to but watch yourself though duke
i dont wanna hear all of that loud mouthing
try to pull yours out when nothing comes out
then youll see why you cant compete with me
the notorious guru of the gang you see
starr stands for power like i said before
im like the doctors cure slicker than roger moore
i slide up to a crab mc like this
tap em in the head with my mic like this
ill be revealing that youre weak to the world if you wish
and i insist that if you persist
then you get creamed cuz imma get real steamed
so dont you try to flex and try to look all mean
heyo check it thats dead thats it
cuz all you phony ass rappers imma bust your shit

now when you see me on the set you know i may unleash
a lyric like a mad dog barking through the speaker
step off unless you wanna get torn up
your raps worn out burnt out fucked up
you lucked up or maybe you lucked out
cuz at the battle last time you snuck out
but now im rolling over you full blast
im here to let you know no longer will the bull last
mcs telling lies and poppin all those myths
keep on fakin moves and immaverse one guru

no way youll never make it
come with the weak shit i break kids
step into my zone mad rhymes will stifle ya
lines like rifles go blast when i kick some ass
a lot of rappers be like one time wonders
couldnt say a fly rhyme if there was one right under
their noses i hate those motherfuckin posers
but im so real to them its scary
and with my unique skills nah you cant compare me
and no we dont make wack tracks
and all the suckers get pushed back when im kickin real facts
i represent set up shit like a tent boy
youre paranoid cause youre my son like elroy
and youd be happy as hell to get a record deal
maybe your soul youd sell to have mass appeal

verse two

oh yes im greater than all mcs when i breeeze give me room please
i be like fascinatin when i be updatin
cuttin off wack kids pullin their trump cards
i thump hard and make em say that im god

but i get props like a slogan and no man
could ever try to diss when i kicks my jam
lyrically def and connecting complete mic wrecking
no double checking vocals kill like weapons
but if i have to i go all out with no mic
yeah thats right cause i survived mad fights
and for my peeps i truly care
cause without some of them i wouldnt be here
and they all know how i feel
cause suckers be like playin themselves to have mass appeal

verse three

i know im dope but dont wet that
ive suffered setbacks but now im makin greenbacks

your headll bop when i drop my crop
of pure bomb just like the seashore im calm
but wild with my monotone style
because i dont need gimmicks
gimme a fly beat and im all in it
word is bond i go on and on

that they gon come and see me tomorrow and have somethin for them
- word so what up

verse one
whos the real criminals take a look behind the scenes
corruption and greed is commonplace routine
guess it pays in many ways to have a few schemes
shit i know model citizens that aint squeaky clean
you got dirty politicians dirty judges and dirty cops
everyones on the take the hoods filled with dirty blocks
how we gonna save the community they worse than us
its like a curse for us police be the first to bust
think about it that rico shits no fuckin joke
for them the evidencell vanish in a puff of smoke
i been observant ill never be subservient
i guess you get what you deserve in this
from project hallways to courthouse hallways
some prevail most see jail this happens always
speed on before you get peed on
all i need is more power then ima put the squeeze on

hook
i want more power im gainin more troops
im gaining more respect cause i want more juice
the most influential men got influential friends
and ima put the squeeze on all of em

i watched yall get fat now i want my share

the most influential men got influential friends
and ima put the squeeze on all of em

im righteous but i might just unvail my portfolio
the plot just thicken and youve been stricken like polio
whos so-and-so im tired of the lackluster busters
its the black general custard the king conductor to dust ya
touch ya cuz you had nerve to try and conjure
a way to surpass the master but now i bombed ya
skiggy-hair man style like lee archer
