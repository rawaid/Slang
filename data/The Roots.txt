rhythm when i get anti-circular

only what i was cause i crush an mc

crazy off key never talk softly 
blacker than tha beans still i never sweat coffee
tha fourth beat following tha third word second after first
yo never rehearse tha verse that im freestylin

and give a style flowin like i was tha nile river you shiver

black thought

if i said dont get it black you know id be a hypocrite
levels often fluctuate to surplus from deficit
rated with the x is the x-tra x-plicit grits
i slides and slips and dives and dips
into it it being grits that i gets like a quaker
but take the raincoats for the oats
when you crush trail mix yo i dig my grits fixed slow
with butter you slip up in the grits and make em other
some people call it skins but grits is the other term
that you gots to learn to keep up on all the scoop
i get a little ends but never spends loot
for the wiggle some immature kids like to laugh
so they giggle for the grits and when they get close
they start skitz-in not this kid because i switched in
flipped in changed the position that i hits in-side
i glide words cant describe how i move be
like hittin a doobie thoughtll get ya groovy so
yo black heres a bit of advice
your wifes nice so you better keep the girls away
from the grits getter

who gets the grits say what bust it let a
brother tell another about the real grits getters
yeah the grits getters get the grits yall
* repeat 4x w/ minor variations *

malik blunt
yeah i likes to unzip it strip it then grip it
to be specific i wont like it so get the ticket
flip it like it was a coin put the loins in the groins
in other words the groins i stretch now you gets the sketch
you know i use my mark like the worm on noahs ark
but if i happen to see a spark i umm parks my bark
guess i haves to rest my num before the next number to sum
but so i cant slumber or sleep my shovels diggin deep
peep this hick whose name was vickie
gettin tricky rather slicky
her performance showed endurance
she said me like to licky licky
body more gracious or should i say bodacious
took my order then she sorta served me
like she was a waitress
never will i say that she was tasteless
maker of the pastry sos i calls her pastress
still enthused cause i got my cruise on
p-o-l-o blues on when i choose to move i puts my shoes on
protection against infection
erect projections travels south in your mouth
like a dentist checked in commence to be intent
she said i cant understand you but damn you like prince
i make it feel like a zulu from honolulu
by the way she roll away like a dog who name was ubu
they also said the way i entered from the center
is adventurous imprint on you dentures when i bust
or i thrust mid-atlantic they act like a schitzophrenic
sometimes they panic like im diggin on a planet
i dont gotta beama or a jetta c-ka-reama alla netta
malik is the sleek grits getter

who gets the grits say what bust it let a
brother tell another about the real grits getters
yeah the grits getters get the grits yall
* repeat 4x w/ minor variations *

brother uestion
i would be lyin if i told you i could not
prepare a fat bowl of sticky grits for a quickie
humans get picky and judge it by the thickness
but if it bends your spoon then add some butter with the quickness
i might get a bit smoother if you move it to a
better position thats probably what she wishin
you can add some groovy spices to give it extra
but my advice is to first let it simmer
hot if its hot then let the pot sit and cool
cause if you spill your milk we label you beginner
humans gotta know that i keep my bowl full of grits
swingin with their daughters while their parents throwin fits
tellin me to change my diet plan to bran cereal
or rice i tried that twice it didnt work
in fact it made my milk kinda sour
half and half part creamer and skeemer
thats why if its grits then it gotta be organic
cause if its artificial i panic

who gets the grits say what bust it let a
brother tell another about the real grits getters
yeah the grits getters get the grits yall
* repeat 4x w/ minor variations *

yo man what about me man
* everybody clowns *
yo man just pass your grits down man
you needs to eat gerber man

kid crumbs
who gets the grits now let me tell ya
a plenty posse bloom from the cellar to nail ya
daughter or your sister the younger skins elixir
kick a cat but i wont like a cat ill figure
id rather play the thigh kisser sister
i dont die swift and yo im not a quitter
so umm let me place my hands upon that waist and trace
my way to the right nip and left nip then sip
similac until my jimmy grows fat grab my pack of hats
from the back then flee to the next block
to knock off socks yo you know my props
so father dont bother
cause once the grits is hot yo theyre good as got

who gets the grits say what bust it let a
brother tell another about the real grits getters
yeah the grits getters get the grits yall
* repeat 4x w/ minor variations *

* talking to fade *black thought
from the never never tunnels via satellite
ceremonies be commencing in the candlelight
yo is i is up in the res-in-iduals tonight
absolutely because im the kid thats on the mic
and i believe its destiny that i got put
in a position to throw lyrics like a shotput
yo no matter the circumstance
thought can always make you dance
like you got the heebie-jeebies or a hotfoot
the bass is low on the meter less than zero
so while im sinning you be spinning like a planet
yo if you dig the shit im sayin youll be deeper
wish for little and your wishes shall be granted
we plant the seeds yall to grow the roots yall
and mad knowledge i got from the archives
but now i got a crazy fat question
what ever happened to leonard parts one to five

chorus black thought repeat 2x

whyd you ask me that question  i dont know
where did leonard parts one to five go
whyd you ask me that question  i dont know

black thought
chariot chariot come swing low--be
cause its on a lower level that i swing low umm
uestion keeps me up on the swing flow he
dont got a whole name i call him bro the
roots is comin through on your audio
for you to cut the roots down i dont think so
because the sound from the ground is like be--low
and when the liquid kicks in then the roots grow
now my ace boom coon plus amigo
was shadrach meshach and nbendago
there was a alpha to omega motion system
but i just call them a to o
and in all states the rootsll rock a fat show
because i drop art like i was pa-blo
and pa-blos last name was picasso
but as for cash flow i dont got no
dividends and ends to spend on blow yo
where did leonard parts to five go

speaking of os im hard to sink like a cheerio
and i speak up loud so you can hear me yo
is it a tribe called quest  is it the jbeez
were cool like dat but yo were not the dps
its the group the roots with the organic rap style
plus the groove from the rhythmic rhyme file
umm im a big fan of the soul
but im trying to get this roots shit in control
so i hate when people say
umm - you remind me of de la soul
cause i got a soul of my own and umm
yo the roots are taking big steps and
you can listen as we progress in
sometimes i might come to teach a lesson
other times its with a crazy question like

because yo your ambitions i wont neglect
and to them brothers who aint here nuff respect

pass the what pass the popcorn 4x

secondly i speak for the uest from the s-q-t square roots
and im black thought therefore you know its funky
the rhythms he recycles sometimes prehistoric
the mic for the popcorns like metaphoric its metaphoric baby
so many different factors in a uestion style
cause hes the father and hes giving more than one child
the abstract soloist drummin from the heart
all the way from philly in the west part
relax your mind and let your body be at rest
flow in slow mo and let the brother manifest
now the second verse has been born
im black thought and i pass the popcorn
on to kid crumb i pass the popcorn

pass the what pass the popcorn 4x
say what
pass the what pass the popcorn 4x

from the southern section of philly my affection
affiliates me with kids from the store to pastry
the foreign object direct from  with the skit
that be rugged it was the drumsticks and the buckets
back in the days now the rubber band plays to accompany
uestion upon the drums and displays mad soul
soul be the source of the blam roots fam
as we grow and expand like the afro
with menacing music seriously im sinister
i shout move about turn it out like minister
diggin the flip-side when i slide i gets biz with
mad melanin chocolate like a chip thats black man
from the dark room with the mad raps homegrown
knots and knaps upon the dome from thinkin
im sinkin in the sound cause i gets and got down
lettin black thoughts out of lockdown buckshot
lick it to the tick of my measures on the richter
grits getter so grab your sister
i get wreck so check my respect from the wreck

ad libs to outroblack thought
peaceful minds in a land of war
seek peace of mind through mental peacefulness
peacefulness peacefulness peace-ful-ness
is in the mind of the beholder
behold my mental piece
could shatter your peace to pieces
pieces and portions of rhythmic distortion relax me
the echos reverb and feedback of reality disturb my peace
forcing me to retreat to the below beneath
down a step and a step and a step and a step
and a step beyond
to a level of my own
private mystic ritualistic culturalistic sanity
yet some say that i am insane
is that not ironic  my soul not sonic
as i flow through the tonic of life i find
that the strife behind that pushes and pulls
and pulls and pushes me
into all of the bullshit that i experience from day to day
is the reason for my search or journey or struggle
to find the broken pieces of the sign
that combine to form the crooked line
that we call peace yallashes to ashes and dust to dust 8x

chorus black thought 4x

its common dust yall and you dont stop
for you to trust yall with real hip-hop

black thought
thought be the  of the styles of speech
a dusty head brother mighta saw the bleach

smoke gems with the folk from the cellar when they come
mouth be like cotton got sticks of gum

accumulation much cause naps i got nuff
funk feeds the dome see the trees they wanna rise
out sprouts the  free to vocalize

but anyway the wind blows the dust you gotta go

chorus

black thought

and dig it with the kids with the dust-y dome

dust you gots not cause your rooms is clean
trust i knows much cause i blows the horn
its common dust yall you go on and on

chorus w/ variations to endblack thought

every single lyric is prepared in the hunt for the metro
with scoops of fat loops and funky lingo
levels being felt all over in the fifty states
breaking more beats than my moms breaks the china plates
transmitting hitting areas we freak with funk
when we come to planet earth with a trunk of fat soul

most can play high post but yo that dont mean shit

then shoot the roots poetic courageously kinetic
vagabond versatile and various plus rap styles

foot seven inches in height

cause much affliction with my diction friction slips and carries
words and hers like some cattle in the steeple

urges of splurge and words will just be merged
together damn its quite clever however
you never can sound alike lyrics dont be poundin like
these troops who bes roots
insult ya mellow of culture rhythmatic vulture
approach ya with magnetic shit thats ultra
i make mcs dangle like a bangle
strangle from every angle my lingo jingles and it jangles
under kangols nahh them niggaz dont want to tangle
cause roots get loose negroes get juiced like the mango
to be particular extra-curricular for pleasure
measure in any weather value more than the treasure

you wanna turn and page your eyes and try to plagerize
but i degrade ya slaughtered ya and slayed ya
microphones i grip equipped to flip the hyp-ocrites
and nit-wits with tidbit skits them aint *shhh*
that was a curse but i divide it in half

jeff x can rock the mic with tooth decay
i be the 5 foot 7 residing at the mecca lesson south section
used to cut class in the infinite pursuit of ass
back in eighty-six
easy with the chics i was a chocolate boy
raised in the cellar with the rhythm like ella
walking down the streets to the subway where i lay
til the train stop then a nigga hop
used to do the pop dance to the planet rock
at the block party everybody jocked who me
its the mc sucka niggaz envy
i got my contract in 1993 and 
i shall proceed

chorus repeat 2x

i shall proceed
and continue to rock the mic

verse two

i wake up early in the morning i mean early afternoon
break a lyrical hymn of the stem like boom
im flyer when im higher put my shit up on a tomb
that nigga represented on the 28th of june
im representing philly on the 28th of june
i can make you feel that im a surreal cartoon
with my pistol in the face of hip hop stick in your face
because im on a paper chase yes im on a paper chase
my timberlands are fully laced i be the mr boogeyman 
with records from 125th to japan
i laid them play like johnny hathaway and shake a hand shake a hand
your lady tried to kick it but i couldnt play my man
my niggaz is my niggaz ya see she didnt understand
i shake your hand and shitll hit the fan just think
just think what what if you could just blink what
just blink yourself away

chorus

verse three

malik b get on the mic yo theres too much on my mind say what
malik get on the mic theres too much on my mind
johnny on the spot got the rhythm and the rhyme
fuckin with the roots you know them niggaz is the dime
i can make a hundred yard line start to dash
i can make a whole lake of fish start to splash
i can make conan and the titans clash
i can metallica and guns n roses crash
used to smash crash parties like i was disturbed
used to make plots against the herringbone herb
but now all i do disperse the verb
and like a nerd i can make you say hes superb
word is perfect never ever shall you misinterpret
i move styles like bowels so now you know im worth it
direct from philly the lands where niggas scheme
so you know i got the sheen in my gleam

chorusverse one malik b

yo im every mc its all in me
thats the way it is when ya gotta be
indeed as i distort i proceed i need
gettin hotter than sacks of boom in my room at the ramada
four tanks in your memory banks to fill up
i provide the static with scratch to match while you catch the vibe
most can play high post but yo that dont mean shit
because my clickll make a motherfucker sick
i flips redder than pork comin to new york to mix
its bob powers with the snares and kicks to fix
rhythmatically you got ta be static-y
magiccally i appear spark a l and drink a beer
with air smooth takin niggaz loot with dice
then shoot the roots poetic courageously kinetic
vagabond versatile and various plus rap styles
of mine are blunt pain is in the mind so im fine and five
foot seven inches in height
my mission to strike mics and lighten your tights
ridin in like lightning
flourescent incandescent evervescently
i represent foreign objects and ill elements
very relevant plus intelligently managin matter
thats makin tracks fatter revolve around
saturn like rings and brins swings when i sings with bass
then distort up in your face like mace
bustin your dreams i gasp with loaded magazines
im on the rap scene re-color fellas like a vaccine
as i rocks from under blunderin im not lyrically
ya getm shot get caught so distort with thought for real
its the illest out the phi short for philidelph-iada-fly

verse two malik b

now go get your dictionary and your pictionary
cause much affliction with my diction friction slips and carries
words and hers like some cattle in the steeple
people theres no equal or no sequel
so policies of equalities get abolished
demolished distortion of the statics gettin polished
urges of splurge and words will just be merged
together damn its quite clever however
you never can sound alike lyrics dont be poundin like
these troops who bes roots
insult ya mellow of culture rhythmatic vulture
approach ya with magnetic shit thats ultra
i make mcs dangle like a bangle
strangle from every angle my lingo jingles and it jangles
under kangols nahh them niggaz dont want to tangle
cause roots get loose negroes get juiced like the mango
to be particular extra-curricular for pleasure
measure in any weather value more than the treasure

i wont smirk cause my names not urkel
the voice with the multiple choice she does a circle
you wanna turn and page your eyes and try to plagerize
but i degrade ya slaughtered ya and slayed ya
microphones i grip equipped to flip the hyp-ocrites
and nit-wits with tidbit skits them aint *shhh*
that was a curse but i divide it in half
gets the airplay no fair play youre feelin the wrath
of malik aiyyo get tragic negroes that get dramatic
because i have the habit to smoke rabbits like a addict

made a niggaz dream but his hope deferred then stirred
dig the mentals papermate bics and number 2 pencils
my credentials blow on instrumentals
i write an anthem throw a tantrum and remain handsome
mysterious vibes like i was the phantom
erupt abruptly then conduct amaze

then when im groovin im no longer human
id like to take this time to give a shout to all the money makers
in the house galore they help me turn it out
i whip the cap to the max im laid back like your gramps
i make niggaz unbalanced like they spendin food stamps
i take my time when i rhyme lovely me nah like
ugly like god we get odd to the rhythms
rappers thinkin of steppin up what the fuck youre doin
i amplify the hymn to bring your empire to ruin
whos your girl screwin fellas jealous because im fly
keep my sneakers dry when you cry-baby
see i can have you headin for the border like a refugee from haiti
aiyyo this brother drivin my cab tried to flip saying
pay me in advance -- i asked him if he ever danced
in the dark with the rap devil blackthought
see niggaz who get caught off guard remain scarred
into air with headphones remainin on the domes they hair
i resound and astound and scare i reign terror
into another nigga rap era my rhymes sedate
i duplicate like aloe vera

was doin at six she was invitin me to the flicks
that im with blew a kiss now im in the shower
i meant the bath in which i simmer for half an hour
then got drier put on attire to inspire

hit my dresser for numbers of women that i admire
laid around and lounged til around two
then i got up and ate drank a brew and caught a page from the crew
sayin where ya at later meet us up at the plat
bring a sack ayo its saturday its gonna be fat
now its 337 and i still aint left the rest
electric relaxation from a tribe called quest
with the boom tokin smokin coolin out
as i parlay in my room cause its a lazy afternoon

cause its a lazy aaaaaahh dental style -

black thought
yo niggaz can not see me can not be me or
capture the metaphoric phrase blasted off stage when i tour
i am but a messanger born to blow up
my niggaz knew it all the time lyrically i was a dime
at the age of nine shorty black could rhyme
on the mic i never wasted time im the exquisite wizard
when i visit shorties i hit it im cool as a blizzard
nigga what  you wanna bust your fronts with the butter my
black paper chase ya and then erase ya rhyme
sucker mcs how i hate it when you waste your time
my state of mind shine like its diamond studded
im rhyme budded on stage word is bond when im on i rage
got the 12 gauge at the rest so play and into rest you lay
my everyday mo is gettin dough cause times is rougher
than a mother for brothers to scuffle shuffle your cards kid
cause the odds is niggazll hustle and live foul
this wild environment hostile produce the music in me
so my styles the blend of what is and was
you could get a buzz from it but enter too deep
and reach a summit you fall and then plummit beyond real
where youre killed if your raps aint ill
another crab motherfucker nother cap to peel
through these amps i motivate camps to dance
niggaz too advanced i warn im just tellin you what goes on

do you wanna know what goes on *2x*
	tell me baby
do you wanna know what goes on *2x*
	tell me baby

myself aka elo the cosmic eye
inside my head you wish to see
the signs appear the shits not clear
what if i flipped would you know how to maintain your edge
im takin heads because theres no fuckin ledge
i pledge allegiance to my cosmic guide
i couldnt fit in three dimensions if i tried
civilizations i can delete so crews dont bother me
battle with jehovah gaining universal soveirgnty
niggaz run around like clones i got planets and thrones
throughout the galaxy my names well known my names well known
im all alone in my zone you wouldnt understand
stare in my face fuck around and catch a scar man

those half-assed negroes know theyre no contenders
in syringes i can shoot up lyrical vengeance
and my grammar might do a mandatory life in slammers
you should regret it thinkin about steppin to me
niggaz forget it - youll get gassed with lyrics leaded
most energetic i never snag im tightly threaded

i said sabrina yea i met you way back in december; you remember

substitute to santa she was sittin on the desk
and then she said you never called me; mailk you never tried to press
you never tried to push the seven buttons and address
i said hold up sis -- youre out of order man you lost it
my name aint jake; maliks no flake thats frosted
tryin to cause a scene sabrinas rest is self-redeemed
she thought she was cute but never made it on my team

and treating me silently

silentlyverse one black thought

lyrically versatile
my rap definition is wild
i wrote graffiti as a juvenile
restin on deuce trey
and used to boost gray kangols
with 555 souls from the streets
of the ill-a-delphiadaic insane
for monetary gain niggaz is slain on the train
its homicide
for wealth stealth missions for crack
in the alleyways where niggaz get grazed in the back
from stray shots
clips with hollow tips for your spine or
either remain calm catch a rhyme to your mind
niggaz ya know my style
i run a--motherfuckin-rap--muk
when malik get a u-haul truck
i stand five foot seven in command of the party
and scam like uncle sam
im never caught up in the glass eye
of your action cam cause im down low
artistic exquisite rap pro that get the dough
its the philly borough dread
thoroughbread for dolo
i bag solo like a nigga that boost polo
steppin through the corridor of metaphors
lookin over my left
shoulder the mic still feel colder than before
with this jazz shit i hit your jaw
dice raw get up on the mic my young poor
i be the nigga blowin up the spot on tour
surely real to the core old school like eighty-four
i never die and raps till my lungs collapse
then relax until my knack for tracks
bring it back on time
when i rhyme my rep remain
either go against the grain or your ass is found slain
i overcome niggaz want styles then i throw you some
show you some get on the mic and take it over son
dice raw the motherfuckin wild noid
get on the mic and perpetratin is void

verse two dice raw

ya leave niggaz missin in action like their dads in the projects
my style like an old mac travel round and catch wreck
im ill versatile with the skill no more
wack mcs wanna flex but their styles they bore
got to know the real meaning of the ill shit kid
i do mad damage but never will catch a bid
with my knapsack full of ill shit that i just boosted
from the corner store when i let loose more
flavor thats me rippin heads off from the seams
niggaz didnt play like jeru and come clean
he heh ha ha ha i beat down on they heads like drum machines
or 808s cause my style flows out great
and superspectac with all the raw rap
pull a metal chair out my knapsack across your back ka-crack
now do you feel the pain of course
i guess youre believin that im insane
when im taggin my name upon the train i got so much pride
i got so much soul with lyrics high
to make niggaz stop drop and roll now check me out one time
for your ass fat styles equivalent
of an aids infected glock blast
niggaz know my style plus they know they want more
props from mount vernon to mount rushmore
ok kid you know my style is buckwild literature
that you can never get when im thinkin your particular
flavor that you want
i sit back and smoke a fat blunt in class
teachers can kiss my ass im twice dice
nigga de raw never take a bad fall
smack your head up against the wall
like playin handball my styles ill
i slam like hulk hogan dice raw bettin on my arm
niggaz know my slogan while i breathe your last breath
niggaz better watch they step fat bull catch wreck
ill gots ta keep you in check
with the hellified beats and hard rhymes
niggaz know my style when i go the whole nine
i beat down punks cut em up into fruit chunks
like fruit salad my styles smooth like white owl
blunts so whatcha want if you got beef then come get it
if ya dont well then forget it
my rap styles exquisite im raw daddy
like niggaz with no trojans on the stage when i rhyme
i gots ta keep my composure
where im from its like a whole different world
hoppin a train honeydip and ima snatch your squirrel
most corrupt motherfucker in the tenth grade
juvenile cause jeff mckay could not fade
dont ask me honey im not the one for stressin
if you wanna know better ask brother 
cause he know the time like i know the time
when i grab the microphone
its like summertime laid back to recline
in my la-z-boy chair
dice raw the wild noid
im the fuck up outta here* phone dialed and rings *

ursula rucker
i the voyeur peer as she begins her ritual
paying sexual ties for few and untrue
words of admiration translation
sucker ass lines of trash
spewing from first ones unskilled lips
that beg for pussy tricks that make his dick go quickly limp
she pimps her innocence as second one demands entrance
through the back door 
bend over bitch you know this is what you were born for;
to dig those soft and lotioned knees into the floor --
and take it in that sweetly spread ass like a real pro whore
her subsequent screams seemed to praise
sent messages of pleasure and pain to his fuck tainted brain
but her screams masked laughs at his dumb ass
as he quicker comes then third and fourth one just as dumb
invite themselves to join in
third one wants to hit the skins old-fashioned style
while fourth one says
dont she got some dsls make a nigga joint just swell
to think  i wanna sink my inches into that bitchs
berry-framed mouth
so one goes north the other south
to sanctified places where in-house spirits
will later wash away all traces of their ill-spoken words
and complacent faces
and then like their minutemen predecessors
lude aggrandized sexual endeavors end up rough
cause neither one of them could keep that weak shit up
corrupt fifth one steps to her
hip-hop clothed just to think he gonna impress her
hey slim i heard you was a spinna -- sit on up
top this thing black dick and work it like a winner
with the quickness he got his pseudo-thickness all up in her
but suddenly he stops mid thrust

*yvette smalls pager goes off*

seems she nameless to cuz got his stuff in a death cunt clutch
he fast falls from the force of her tight pussy punch
just like the rest of that sorry ass bunch
now here comes six ready to add his inactive shit to the mix
talkin smack at that
saying girl ima wax that ass and stick that slit so hard
you gonna be calling me god
so he proceeds to poke and prod
with clumsy finger and wack sex slinger
condoms make me last longer wrong cause her
motions of snatch however detached from the situation
cause his pre pre pre-ejaculation
it seems she just wastin
good pussy and time on dudes like number seven
who aint learned their lesson
he wants to enter the flesh divine
by dropping a kind of semi-sweet line
your honey hole so fine and mile deep; im gonna leap
into you like an ocean do you right and make your head spin
so he jumped in and then he drowned
got lost and found in her tart canal
slave to the waves made him cum for days
eighth and last one turn arise
plys her with familiar lies
even more familiar still cause
him she used to love
but he never could quite see above her mound
a pound of flesh is all she was no name no face or even voice
so poised she rises -- phoenix from the flame
finally bored with their feeble fuck games
she smooth reaches behind her and takes straight aim
at eight shriveled up cocks with a fully loaded glock
parts lips not expressly made for milding dicks
and then she speaks

your shreiks of horror bring me bliss i must admit
the thought that i could shred your tips with eight quick flips
excites me see yall fuck with the pussy
but i fuck with your minds
lack of soul and respect is the crime
this was a set up now tell me what whats my name
* gun cocks *its jazzy hip-hop hanging in my head heavy  
malik said riq you know the planet aint ready for the half  
boy we comin with the action pack  
on some dundee shit representin the outback  
yo we do it like this all the way live from  
2-1-5

master gettin cash in an orderly fashion  
the attractive assassin blastin the devil trespassin  
message to the fake nigga flash-in  
slow-up oc before you get dropped  
and closed like a caption  
fractional kids dont know the time for action  
styles got the rhythm that of an anglo-saxon  
round of applause then avalanche a clappin  
*plow* thats what happen now whats your reaction  
we heavyweight traction pro-pornographin  
specialize in science and math and  
original black man  
vocal toe to toe impeccable splittin your backs son  
bustin thoughts that pierce your mental defense  
rippin your sacks and  
simple as addition and subtraction  
black thought- the infinite relaxed one  
shorties say they love it with a passion  
bring the international charm  
see a squad i harass  
react  
you best adapt when i sling this rap  
another chapter  
before when i have to trap ya  
map your whole path out  
go get your crowd so we can clap out  
i drive down streets and take back route- positionin  
when im in your system like glycerin  
fans listenin  from michigan to switzerland  
malik be blitzed again- on the station with the discipline  
solicitin  sometimes illicit or explicit with it then  
from the deep end where the hills are steep  
nobody cares to speak- a land where life is cheap  
the street mentality mixed with the intellect  
niggas rebellious  
personality hell where i dwell is well  
my man caught a shot to the stomach  
bodies are found down in the cellars  
now who want it  
confronted by these dusty blunted- cats  
who act like they dont know that the fact is that theyre being hunted  
a process of elimination  
activate your mind with the stimulation  
enter your zone with penetration  
ive seen more horror than brahm stroker  
strip your broad a play poker then drink mocha  
the sometimes socializer  
you woke the wiser  
the joke despiser  
dealin with the roots vocalizer  
i stampede your style  
up in your flesh from south philly to west  


ill compile the bless

hey yo im just a lyricist  
the beat pimp  
a chemist of the hemp  
the ill philly resident  
thats far from hesitant  
never benevolent  
corrupt like a president  
but poetically prevalent  
cooler than peppermint  
far from temporary son im very permanent  
the lieutenant for niggas talkin bout represent  
hittin mcs like an intoxicant  
no doubt its obviously evident i get bent  
sent to prevent  
monopoly is my intent  
the means is what i invent  
this mental murder pay the rent  
lyrically im the dominant ingredient  
the swift extravagant  
smooth lubricant  
down with the m-the-ill-itant  
ch-ch-ch thats the sound of the dynasty chant  
we surround your camp  
assumin the war stance  
and bring it from the chest  
now lets dance  
m-ill-itant  
feel the fifth gorilla chant  
yall talk about bodies  
but you would not kill a ant  
my skill is amp  
would peel a nigga like a stamp  
caliber is of excallibur now you be damp  
when i operate a crop or copulate my game  
i make a womb populate and 2-1-5th is this stock of hate  
peep the logistics  
slump your squad of misfits  
they all get they wrists slit  
blast your ass if you insist it  
leave no trace so theres no trace for ballistics  
in particular ive got that extracurricular  
turn your soul and body to statistics  
slip and they vicking ya  
squad in the stash who could be stcking ya  
harass your police commissionar  
dont like chicks with weaves talking bout i need conditioner  
that shits deader than niggas with a mortioner  
a gymnanza  
up in your flesh like plasma  
take away your last breathe when you got asthma  
then meet bad lieu down at the plaza  
hip-hop extravaganza  
tell your man i slump him with a stanza  
now whos the boss not tony danza  
po took a piss test it came out not clean  
my force not green but the force is obscene  
brody with my man miz-moose and hakeem  
my squad from deuce-four up the west oak lane  
all the way to takahwana and frankfurt they know the name  
its like that m-ill-itant

black thought
yall know the dynasty the roots repertoire
the lieutenant from the reservoir serve the spar
the injurar preditar of a competitar
i send mcs where the paramedics are
at first im like nah im nonchalant from afar
then strike to cut the fake rap star jugular
with irregular balance of the cat burgla-rar
known to parlay with garcia vega cigars
i know the flavor because me and the thugs minds are mutual
we congruent lay on the corner with the trauma unit
im from the lab where the bombs distibuted
so never try to duplicate the skills executed
son youd get electrocuted from the worldwide reputed
shine like nickel heat that blow your mind when i shoot it
some know me as the man thats from the roots crew
others as the bad lieutenant of snyder avenue
we go an eye for an eye
behead like a samurai thatll command the dynasty until he die
who will imply that i lack a-biliti
make your words known amplify the u-tiliti
im crooked like the i on a toxic malt liquor
the land whipper the dom perignon champ sipper
the fifthll bring it all together like the zipper on a butter leather
the bad lieu a bring the bad weather
so to whoever got riff let it rest
reflect then recollect on the way it was set
its the veteran architect that flows with the rhythm of sex
be on the low shotgun in the lex
with my man low to flex
im restin where they handle the tecs
and the lyrical vandal is next flow
so my man my mizza my man
m-ilitant whats the master plan
once again

chorus

moms listen to they daughter story about my packets
the adverse is on your table stabilize emotion
a soldier at ease but on post of up most in
brag and boast in my anecdotes that choke
invade your whole terrain you feel the pain provoke
when i breaststroke your wavelength of intensity
my alliance bring forth to you an entity
your whole vicinity i contaminate with hate
got no time to debate but hold up wait sit straight
its in mil the elicit you violate you get a ticket
mcs you cant tell i expel you get evicted
from out your misery serve your ass with my delivery
allah makes the ground you steppin on shivery
permanent tears run through your thoughts you queers
its all upstairs where theres a crowd table and chairs
for years been on the mic im like a dike with stairs
when i strike i stay severe niggaz stay low in they glare
from over here my range rover square to blast offside
switch the pitch from southpaw to unorthodox
i shock your brain with the miscellaneous
who beez the zaniestnigga with words that are spontaneous

yeah you in tune to another ill 
5th dynasty production baby fading outblack thought
i woke up in the darkness at 1217to shots and sirenes
look out the window peep the high beams
now they searchin the cops lookin for the person 
that pulled the trigga
medical figures is nursin the kid that got shot
some innocent ak that would front
to flip the rock on them at king street block
i tried to tell him to stop cuz yo its ghetto red hot
similar to the blood now floodin his top
i take a step out the spot to the point of attack
and see the shorty wop heart blast out his back
damn im thinkin it dont cease its no more peace
police level increase but what the fuck
its still crime on the streets
i cant breathe now whats goin on
one minute you alive the next youre gone
illadel-p-h-i-a hell
bust off into the heavens for the nigga who fell
and hit the l for the niggaz who fell
when that could have been prevented
in front of the flat your moms rented
and no one expect that from you cuz you was timid
fuckin with them cats from outside city limits
funny how this whole thing changed an off minute
yo dig it panic
none of this is ever granted
drownin in a nightmare strandedhook
dig it this world is filled with homicides and rape
all the crimes of hate just aint the size and shape
you can walk dont the block and get slumped or knocked
it dont stop yall and it just dont stop       x2

black thought
i leave the microphone intrigued with my practice
this rebel stick your system like a cactus a boys sadness
who knows what is concealed under the mattress
ruegurs losses and grindals when my minds in blackness
then i act this way the beast unleashed
rabbis monks and priests always pray for peace
but its deceased now only lives the true realance
open up the mental deaths you rented through my palace
my thoughts contain the plus sign plus the malice
not equating to your wonderland so fuck alice
my style is hostile on the external
but got plenty of love and warmth thats internal
the sin coronal
surfaces from whispers from the lower
my noun like arks and 950 years of noah
youre arch rival
you burn a cross i burn the bible
because im liable to do this
when my actions true this
but id rather choose to use my diction
resurrect that blond blue eyed and put him through another crucifixion
stay up in your jurisdiction say what 
my depiction is the drama 
though these eyes ive seen the trauma 
homicides in the source that was phenomenal
when i find out who banged muwan in his abdominal
met with jesus to learn to burns not commical
at times this thing aint logical
i gots to walk around with my brain on cock
cause it cant cant wont wont dont dont stop

malik b m-ill-it-ant
my mentals in flame your brains will drain
when i let the ink drip and then pass out a pink slip
i think quick so check my methodology
my stylagy is more ranty than anthropology
between your raw legs like its gynecology
you and your sorry ass style needs an apology
cause an earthquake and make you shake you need neurology
these niggas kill me actin like stars fuck they astrology
imagin with my badge i snatch the pagent
turn your city to a smashing and grab it
now its time to burn the maggots my message stronger than elisha
that backslap the ass like your father
why bother
would any care for lyrics i sling from my mic with cease your laughter
mind of a bachelor to a master
what i thought that leaves you flabbergasted
ask you whats the matter bastard
these types of rhythms man youd rather blast it
you hear the beats in jeeps over the weekend
silence is golden and niggas get killed just for speakin
the only deacon is death when ya left wounded
layin on the ground and meet your doom quick 
i done been through the deserts of hell with satin sittin waitin
contemplatin and trying to get me for the takin
thats why i walk around with my brain on cock
cause it cant cant wont wont dont dont stop

well this another episode with titanic panoramic view is dismantle
depressin um - load with this gun hold
wild like a sun sold for cash
guns traded for sensi and hash crack for ass
entire crews pass not making the news flash
brews pass a memory and spark not to blast
whatever have transform to the war path
pure wrath from north down to 24th and task
games store the half the niggas you were prayin the streets
tainted with camoflouge - guerilla sabotoge
my cousins da ratatard was livin tight large
got caught then blast crashed off on broad and lambar
so many so called hearts scared they burried in the yard
lick shots at babylon de one comfy bombard

yo im fast for the buck do anything for the cream
never seen a case like this although its quite contageous
he even got his little bother actin all outrageous
from dusk to dawn and from dawn back to dusk
they do anything and everything tryin to come up
its kinda sicknin how the cash is so fucking addicted
and when i say some bout they say that thats conflicted
aint nothin but a contradiction in this world we live in
cause the loot is for the takin and not for the givin
then ya got this world well i say ima die hustlin
fuck everybody except my brother who im trusted in
i guess the couple just did not know the truth
cause the following week i seen threw him of the roof
and sometimes i wonder what the fuck i think about that
how nowadays kids get whap for somethin less than a pat
but i guess thats how it goes when there aint no more rap
thought he was his borthers keep but fuck all that

it was the year a 84 i was tryin ta get in the mix
the year the niggas roll with sheepskins kitcells and kicks
even got the patten leather adidas snatched of your feet
man that talk is cheap the cripled cant walk for weeks
the first sto was word to penn and tellers
strolled in the dollar house parties and search for cinderella
was just a little man real bold
tryin to act grown and old so da respect can be shown
a hip hop a little copped in and break dancin
when niggas wore wind breakers plot to take lamb skins
remeber zigglers uptown the bottom to natrona and
st charles in south phil the ooh mob gang
h-r-m ogontz ave brickyard to hollow
niggas was snatchin gazzeles and flippin pockets for tha dallo
you run ya little wolf chain in west oak lane
and niggas from logan came to extort we know tha game
you proclaim this gangster bullshit talk
and never even seen your man shot a bodies in charge
aggravated assualt another weekend in the precinct
take everybody for their ring man thats how we think
back then you catch a sucker punch off guard
niggas will pull you card tryin to walkaround all hard
niggas quick to flip your pockets if you lip service
when you see fifty niggas deep with scullys get nervous

its time to have it all he said he figured he same
we realized this a planet of cream to obtain
when the predominant rap conglomerate rap spark the flame
hark the name the fifth from the ill-power hill at that
he dropped me off within the streets of south phil
where niggaz think that killings living real
shorties is getting wetted fulfilling their fantasies to set it
we dont sweat it by the fifth you get beheaded
i pivot through my borough givin pounds to the dreaded
at the lye spots i got credit; could run em down

ill die-hard soldiers try to make it to-wards the generals
hard-headed rugged captains walkin head on through action
turnkeys on the closed caption
i bring the skills of wizardry
treat mcs with bigotry so now you see the picture vividly
seduce your brain from the temple over instrumentals
the fifth chant you see the exhaust out
the swift camp -- mannerism is to scan your vision
you see the light you cant eclipse the sun
we call back the young but still theyll strap a gun
to shoot caps that spook cats and rappers hung
now you might tube across from the diners where you find em lost
niggaz hearts so cold they sport frost
the m-the-illi-tant the bad lieutenant kill your camp

inclined to rap about facts i never fake jacks
shit is real like e packs forty-fifty-sixes
trims and gimmicks couldnt faze the true heartache
when i first started but then few remember this
anti-gangsta bitch sporting new jew-als
plain jane styles internal to the naked eye
derived from mindstates of cold crush tapes
and beat breaks seduced by means to elevate
equates my views with the passing

the principles of true hip-hop have been forsaken
its all contractual and about money making
pretend-to-be cats dont seem to know their limitations
exact replication and false representation
you wanna be a man then stand your own
to mc requires skills i demand some shown
i let the frauds keep frontin
and roam like a cellular phone far from home
giving crowds what they wantin
official hip-hop consumption the 5th dumpin
keepin ya party jumpin with an original somethin
yo i dedicate this to the one dimension-al
no imagination excuse for perpetration

my nine to five is just to hit ya get the party live
im black thought used to rap for sport
now the rhyme saying rent paying life support
i take it very seriously within this industry
its various crews that try to touch me
but i come wit the beautiful things
and i bless the track plushly 
around the world the crowds love me from doing tours
recipient of applause from alla you and yours
creator of original sounds to send to stores you take home
to absorb and sweat it out your pores
now who can stop the music runnin through these veins
infinitely go against the grain

open your head wide and let the thought inside
my style fortified by all of philadel-phi
ive dealt more stealth than all the wicked weal-thy

then i get paid when the record is played

my thoughts wrestle and attack with the killer instincts
of a gorilla stronger than samson

even if it means you gotta hang over the banister
i pull a microphone on any pistol brandisher
and take advantage of ya because you amateur
styles gunning down your sound man and manager
what this how we do it in the year for nine-six
with this delivering attack on pointless rap shit
breakin mcs down to fractions tell your squadron
its time to go to war we spar reaction

chorus 2x

verse two

the implorer the universe explorer
treat mcs like the cities of sodom and gomorrah
leavin these niggaz open like a box of pandora
with styles thats newer than the world order
approximately three quarters of yall are water
i straight deport ya
then orchestrate your torture with roots of culture
the pill brimmage to the line of scrimmage up against your image
where life is a heist and the strong get a percentage
its ill as a war and within it im the lieutenant
that surrounds you like a peninsula to snatch the pennant
you fold like japans futons and fans
while i design a plan to make a rapper step like a pedestrian
i crush a mountain into grands of sand
your pain stains the cannon of the mic inserted into the stand
the desperado that refuse to follow
the lip afficianado break you up into parts like a bottle
i deep like the dark of the night
niggaz is sweet and sound silly when they talk on the mic
they use the simple back and forth the same
old rhythm thats plain
id rather ultramagnetize your brain
its the hip-hop purist that leave you lost like a tourist
inside the chorus niggaz is bringin nothin for us
as we breakin em down to fractions tell your squadron
its time to go to war we spar reaction

verse one mars

first of all lets talk about these ill capers
and fly ass frontin bitches that now caught vapors
niggaz run up on you with guns snatchin papers
outlined body chalk is how they would scrape ya
from off the pavement i hate gettin locked up
cause that upstate bus reminds me of the slave ships
but then the bible never saved shit
i guess thats why every juvenile is in the same predicament
you wanna slang crack or hold tecs and do the concept
you cant make loot when your moms is smokin up the product
i try to tell ya dont let these streets fuckin fail ya
the way niggaz be gettin clapped shitll fuckin scare ya
but in the dark we ran wild so we killin em
niggaz scared cant stand still like fuckin helium
fake niggaz they dont go platinum they go aluminum
got em cloned the fuck up son thats why we losin em
im lookin at this niggaz longevity
to make a big play but then it might be a mistake
cuz if i get sent to dc im sendin dice to de
with three ps so when i get out he can see me
for real cuz the streets is filled with snakes and rats
the snake will be that bitch and that rat will be that cool cat
with swollen pockets we gonna take you back home
master allah rule savior never clone

verse two black thought

yo i use the mic to slap you in the face and erase your taste
disgrace your date put your title to waste
dominant lyrical grace from a place called wild
illadelph isle pensy thats the residency
consist in currency my pockets never empty
some cats believe they mc but we know they all fraud
do a show in philly niggaz wouldnt applaud
nobody know your record nor who you openin for
can tell your squads artificial while approachin the door
so you should prepare for lyrical terror thats pure
step up to the resevoir of the soul proprietor style
messiah or the higher law down with dice raw
the matador shorty conniseur
stompin whatever you build to the floor
similar to that of a dinosaur
i told you im the rap predator
you insist to imitate what for
superstar niggaz is ten percent real ninety percent invented
for a fuckin record deal
comin with somethin veterans cant feel
i hit you like a steel anvil
because you grafted off the next mans skill
but still i remain mellow seein the theatrics of othello
run over tactics of the 
c-l-o/n-e-s fess
the phoniest cats is felonious word

verse three dice raw

dice raw the juvenile lyricist corner store terrorist
block trooper conniseur of fine cannabis
focus never weak blow up the spot like plastique
leave a nigga shook to the point he wont speak
never half-assed always live and direct
on bitches try to punk smell the panty and raw sex
mad lights i had to black out when fake niggaz act out
or step out of place they get slapped in they face
all yall niggaz is fake tryin to emulate my style
what grown man  in this game to me youre a child
i trained wack mcs in camps like ex-marines
why the fuck you think you went home and had bad dreams
of horrifying things that your ass never seen before
you traveled to the realm of dice raw
where clones get they dome blown with chrome microphones
its not your fault black just the fact you wasnt shown
youll come through this like a smurf
i got you rollin stop off the earth
represent while i been like this since birth
and i wont be the last but i definitely was the first

knuckle games and hammer cocked aint nothing sweet or soft
win lose or draw to the jaw take one
deranger lyrical launcher or station
no conversation is needed my task completed

snatch you from your cloud of cannabis you ignoramuses
you laid on your lap when i attack your glamorous
lifestyle i banged your head up with the white fowl
my character a product of this two-one-fifth trife style
i breeze through areas niggaz would fear to walk in
balance the talkin that galactic style as of a falcon

spill these words and form into a sprinkle

beware the new world order the devils new religion

the rock was typed graphic now watch the mic blast it
shootin at the stars with emphatic rap static
see the mirror shatter from thoughts im bustin back at it
the lieuten-ant the ele-phant sippin automatic
mic rippin asiatic architects out to have it
the turn of the century the planets like a penitentiary
exaggerated niggaz is livin highly medicated
i used to love but now she violated
hip-hop holocaust and camps old champs are concentrated
they outdated and incarcerated
loved and appreciated hated and very debated
for every career created was eliminated
and thats the way the balance of yin and yang related

[verse four common]

as the block is de-vine
niggaz swing on in a safari
wild niggaz like im high on latari

hey ima be back on the deck opening
business in places for you to cash your check
my neck of the woods aint all good aint all bad
you can live in the burbs and still get had
the sad part about it niggaz had houses on the lake
they tryin to move us out the land we aint appreciate
for peace we skate crackers we roll or player hate
call each other cuz cause of how we relate
i see way too many cadillacs with dope man plates
through the wind and blow-ups is how niggaz communicate
harmonizing through beeper and reefer
the city got my peoples in a sleeper talk is getting cheaper

search the premises i leave no clues for detectives

you talk about you see me but your visions full of cataract
it dont matter that your glass house i shatter that
bad luck i walk under now show me where the ladder at
pull up the urinal organs up in your bladder cat
approachin you with shriller rhetoric as if you had a sac
now crews down for it your gas pedal floor it
with ammo and artillery and stash spots to keep and store it
i used the banner of a slant with a zort
change your strategic plan my mans getting bored
your vocal chord is fraudulent and not the true porcelain
i bring the fire earth and the source of wind
the force of sin will endorse the pen
we all search for sanity but i think that it was lost again
now which stick of artists can be the smartest
my beam of sunlight shines the brightest in the forest
regardless artists dislike because im 
control the temper makin mcs whimper

plague your neighborhood with lyrical le-prosy
stimulate more than ecstasy yall niggaz check my recipe
dig it i must observe it analyze when im chillin
peep out whos the villain then make your whole pavillion

pass it down to my grandson i got no time to be romancin
only times for mental food and advancement

enhancing is my mental - i play in the midst

my utensils display a whole variety
even when in the cut niggaz cant cut they anxiety
peep i fill your brain with suspicion pay attention
like you paid tuition and stop all your bull-ishin

the mic is my apprentice cause i cant stand 
courts or tennis my pigmentation is the menace
thats why the systems always tryin to pursue with a blemish

i knew this girl named alana with mad persona
she delt with reality never fed it to the drama
i met her through my nigga named jermaine palmer
who knew her through his peoples by the baltimore harbor
alana was a marylan thurough and attractive
shorty thats relaxed with me and kickin back
wif a phat flick to cool out
was stressed cause the gamell make you wanna pull a tool out
and go the old school route
but all-a that cease - when that piece checkin the jewel out
a bruver was charged - light a spliff and listen to the dabarge
let the shorty hit me wif a massage to annoint
lubricatin my maridian points that was the summer easy to remember
alana was all up on - to read the gender how i used to back bender
she even told her best friend blinda from virginia
who asked me if i had a cousin i could recomend-a
but as time float on we grew more mature - and further apart
when i began to do tours we lost contact
and slowly parted - reminissin of when it started
it keep me feelin heavy hearted - a stolen moment periodic
addicted to her presence like a narcotic
though i wonder if she ever got it - the hypnotic
that faded like a dream sequence that pursuaded
beyond being infatuated - spiritually intoxicated
comps are dated - i concentrated
on how to get in touch with her
cuase the fact of the matter remain that i miss the hypnotic

driftin ------- driftin
the hypnotic the hypnotic

driftin ------- driftin

i would begin to dial -
her number but knowin its been awhile its hard to link
i figure what she probly think and soon start to drink
fightin the feelin im concealin apparently i first appealin
later revealin to be deeper - resistance increasingly weaker
the essence of life is more than just mics and puffin reefa
this universe of black thought that i can teach ya
im tryin to touch ya only if i can reach ya
i hit this kid i sign up on his beepa
and ask him if a had a chance to speak ta
jermaine palmer who fathers a preacha
to make the story short me and my man soon ran
into each other von the humble at a show in san fran
i said yo palma when did you last see alana
he offer me a seat and attempts to make me calma
when he began to break it down my mind start to wander
response beyond somber incredible crushed
kinda feelin on my shoulder - that of a boulder
to find out that her life was over - it made the room feel colder
i thought i could get wif her when she was a little older
but she a victim of the wicked system that controlled-a its all chaotic
but if my life its symbolic forever shadow on my mental i never forgot it
yo the psycotic the hypnotic check it out the most melodic hypnotic

im the modern day vixen vampire slayer
unauthorized player in the capitalist contest
to see who gets money
no milk and honey in this land
cause justice has been banned
so its play dirty or die by the hand
thats holding all the guns
plunged deep into religion was my first decision
to save me and my daughters lives but
i cant thrive off spirit and scripture
the picture grew clearer; i made the move to rear her
in a life wanting for nothing
so i got into this drug thing
not doing but dealing
sealing fates and healing struggle gaped wounds
of the doomed became my mission
izm was just too small time
i had to find the best design to
fuck with the massive motherfuckers minds and pockets
so i sold  kits and alleyway thigh splits for two bits
and five year old preschool pussy
and once strong now bony backs and stretched out
weary racks of snatch in other words
 i sold crack
morality was buried deep beneath the new jeep
silk sheets and money heaps
still the good mother i sent my daughter off to
boarding school to keep shit under cover
all the while envisioning myself a champion of ghetto causes
plus his game i was playing and winning
while sinning against myself and soul to get the gold
i was the female don the crack queen
to me i seemed unstoppable my coffers full
i went buckwild wanting more
like the pipe worn whores i began to deplore
no time for playing with my coochie
counting my mans mad lucci
while he was up inside some hoochies loose piece
i signed the checks and i counted out the cash
wasnt saving ass for no niggaz sent upriver
i thought my shit was tight
 til my empire started to quiver
taking every chance under surveillance being listened to
and watched like assata shakur
my place on the top was no more sure
loose lips flipped the script
the fantasy trip swiftly ended
it took no time to blend in with the population prison
my jaded vision busted like a cherry
every dream i had now tainted bad
i fucked and i killed to prosper
upheld each tenant of the ghastly gospel
shift to a different wonderland to pay the price for my vice
a land of fields to toil in like slaves
no lillies in this field just plenty of souls to save
plenty of fat uniformed rats with
below average size cocks that slither
through cell locks in the night
lactating tits being licked left and right
plenty of coochie burning with desire
like black churches in the south
black prayers and pussy on fire
penned up behind barbed wire
me and my fellow female mammals animals
bitches in cages bodies racked with hormone rages
minds haunted by our childrens faces
they mace us with promises of rehabilitation slash corruption
place smoking guns in empty hands of native sisters and sons
i joined in this nations favorite pasttime
on a quest to gets mine
now im passing time standing on line
in the commissary to buy maxi-pads
instead of shopping at barneys for chanel bags
nana who raised me went to bed a-dazed
via my mistakes and my daughter hates
me for what i did
and im fucked and im stuck
doing the devils bid
being locked in a moral corrupt crib
psst missing my kid psst hey girl
you wanna get finger fucked tonight
i swear ill stick it in and up tight just right

yo sis ive had to kill and shit
just blow my head pretty and ill give you a slip
alright ladies lights outfor now the roots remain a little bit of an enigma even to themselves/they have reached the level of their dreams/a major record deal and some international notoriety/but for all that their concept has not yet blown up and it is possible it won’tyou are all
we dont even come to see our own man
listen freddy listen
if we had to depend upon black people to eat
we would starve to death
youve been out there
you on the bandstand
you look out there what do you see
you see japanese you see you see west germans 
you see slobovic you know anything except our people man
it makes no sense it incenses me that our own people
dont realize our own heritage our own culture
this is our music
thats bullshit
why
thats all bullshit everything everything you just said is bullshit
youre complaining about-
im talking about the audience
thats right
the people dont come because you grandiose motherfuckers dont play
shit that they like if you played the shit that they liked 
then the people would come
simple as that

inevitably hip-hop records are treated as though they are disposable
they are not maximized as product not to mention as art

yo i walk a-cross this world thats deceptive
beats are perfected the ghettos infested
with more destruction my vocal eruption
was speakin bout corruption with no introduction
approach me with caution cause i spark losses
m-illitant the rap arson marchin
leavin niggaz stiff like im starchin departin
hollywood sambos and jokes just like martin
im the type of nigga that belongs in a ward
with a mic and a cord to hold your head with a sword
some proclaim lames callin theyselves bold
they shall be flawed when the claps applaud
if this a point of life one i cant afford
then i have to get sheist and i deal in fraud
now back to the topic of the rap philosopher
with more drama than a soap opera
who stops the propoganda the hot block commander
puttin a halt to all the backtalk and slander
warn every challenger about the silencer
muzzle in your mouth for the days thats on the calendar

chorus

black thought
im from the valley of the heavyheads watch the ghetto pre-medical
undergrads and steady red faces of stone
eyes are crevices life like a double negative
philly crimin-al i rhyme my dirt tariq already did
buildin this fifth foundation in the wilderness
thought-less trespass and enter thoughts fortress
limitless entrance paid to the order of the
cypher slaughterer my mic slappin you senseless
defenseless niggaz never movin me inches
the beat fifth invisi-ble in the trenches
afficiando awesome hip-hop drug problem
fuck stardom and chickens up in gotham
poltergeist slit or choke the mic til it scream to me
stop that cash we conveniently got that
i stroll through your scenery cocked back
me and hot mack the nine-eight el dorado cadillac jacks

chorusyoull soon depart *echoes from the last track*

chorus malik b 2x

yo the feet that i walk with
the ears that i hear with the eyes that i see with
the mouth that i talk with the terror that i stalk with
now its time to spark shit

malik b
look god i walk around a little edgy already
yall mcs come into my face but my aims steady
m-illitant is skilled in most strategic plan
i float across seas and breezed across land
standin in these thoughts of murder within
the structure of this world thats corrupted with sin
im always hittin to leave mcs guessin
for any transgression in my perimeter
there will be a blessing and your explicit intoxicated
buddha session to stop stressin
me with the madness puttin niggaz on my had list
no sadness is felt you shuffled and your cards get dealt
jim carrey ass niggaz start to melt
impact like a buckle bein swung from off a belt
any help for shelter when in the realms of a welter
my weight will tilt ya hold alignments and change your filter
my attitude a product of society
so sometimes for gratitude you know you cant rely on me
niggaz eyein me with looks of they anxiety
wonderin whats in my heart velocity or piety
yo it depends on which one you bring to surface
at times i get trife but what to worship is my purpose
malik b blend with the tree to spot an enemy
you cloggin me up cat now vacant the vicinity

chorus

malik b
im symbolic to a ballot its abdul malik
dont approach with bullshit im quick to call it invalid
route through your district we keep it simplistic
no need for the rapper to talk put it on halt
show me the vault or the safe cause im on the paper chase
wade through route states for bout thirty down my waist
im tryin to get it these rain bottlin thoughts become acidic
with one in the chamber ready to aim and spit it
a girlfriend and team made nigga cash just splintered
i take what you got to give cause i got to live
the last hour i bet your ass 
might act up but i still can pass dowa
im usin new ways to try to reach these better days
instead of tryin to take you under i just make you wonder
i still fast make salaat and pay zakaat
i didnt make haj yet but thats my next project
livin two lives one of turn and one with true lies
keepin a hoe knowin these hands into my dua
in the quarters livin modest with my nigga trotter
i circle my foes like tawaf around the kaba
i used to live life like there was no manana
now im treatin every breath like it was your honor
im mill-itill-itant with the fifth that stand firm
like a pillar im i and t-l like manilla

black thought
the anticipation arose as time froze
i stared off the stage with my eyes closed and dove
into the deep cosmos
the impact pushed back the first five rows
but before the raw live shows
i remember ise a little snot-nosed
rockin gazelle goggles and izod clothes
learnin the ropes of ghetto survival
peepin out the situation i had to slide through
had to watch my back my front plus my sides too
when it came to gettin mine i aint tryin to argue
sometimes i wouldnta made it if it wasnt for you
hip-hop you the love of my life and thats true
when i was handlin the shit i had to do
it was all for you from the door for you
speak through you gettin paper on tour for you
from the start thought was down by law for you
used to hit up every corner store wall for you
we ripped shit and kept it hardcore for you
i remember late nights steady rockin the mic
hip-hop you the love of my life

so tell the people like that yall that yall
and it sounds so nice
hip-hop you the love of my life
we bout to take it to the top

common
yo yo i was speakin to my guy riq and
how she was desperately seekin to organize in a konfusion
usin no protection told her on _resurrection_
caught in the hype williams and lost her direction
gettin eight/ate in sections where i wouldnt eat her
an under the counter love so _silent_-ly i _treat_ her
her daddyll beat her eyes all puff-ed
in the mix on tape niggaz had her in the buff
when we touch it was more than just a fuck
the police in her i found peace like who
like malcolm in the east
seen her on the streets of new york trickin off
tried to make a hit with her but my dick went soft
movin weight losin weight not picky - with who she choose to date
to confuse the hate with her struggle i relate
close to thirty most of the niggaz she know is dirty
havin more babies than lauryn she started showin early
as of late i realized that this is her fate
or destiny that brings the best of me
its like god is testin me
in _retrospect_ i see she brought _life_ and death to me
peace to us collectively live and direct when we perform
its just coffee shop chicks and white dudes
over her i got into it with that nigga ice cube
now the fight moved to in life makin the right moves
besides god and family you my lifes jewel
like that yall

black thought
somebody told me that this planet was small
we used to live in the same building on the same floor
and never met before until im over seas on tour
and peep this ethiopian queen from philly takin classes abroad
shes studyin film and photo flash focus record
says shes workin on a flick and could my click do the score
she says she loved my show at paris at elyse montmartre
that i stepped off the stage and took a piece of her heart
we knew from the start that things fall apart and tend to shatter
she like that shit dont matter when i get home get at her
through letter phone whatever
lets link lets get together
shit you think not you think that thought went home and forgot
time passed now were back in philly and she up in my spot

if somethings on your chest then let it be known

and on the topic of trust its just a matter of fact
that people bite back and fracture whats intact

i aint on some oh im a celebrity

black thought
namsayin yall know the legendary roots crew its like

chorus to fadeursula rucker
muffled sound of fist on flesh
blows to chest
no breath
air gasps
you aint nothing but white trash bitch
with each hit each kick eachbroken rib
crack crack
bones are crying
mommys crying and bleeding
and pleading
and then
daddy wants to fuck
dick hard swelled with power rush
and as if all that wasnt enough
mommys seven months heavy with birth
asdaddy grunts and cursed drunk nothings in her bloodied ear

singing softly
firstlullaby
firstsonwilleverhear
and never forget

mommy almost bled to death when she have himfinally
shed already lostthree 
uterus-bruised shredded and weak
&gt;from being daily beat
and friday nights were the worse and
daddy never came with flowers
instead he spent hours at some corner spot
with some bar pop named cookie
putting his thing down
soiling mommys sheets with
sweettalk shit 
cookies cheap lipstick 
hair grease sperm and jezebel juice

to hell with the good news that
he was a father for the first time
his thirst for wine and women
clouded his vision
no warm welcome for mother and son
just
the rank smell of ass-crack funk and cum
but mommys prayerful strength-her best defense
sheburned the dirty linens
made a fresh bed
laid sleeping first son down
and never made a sound
as she purged her scourge
with birth-blood and quiet tears
watching as her fears and love and sacrifice
lie there in his soft skin and new life
breathing dreaming fresh from gods eye
mommys little survivor
likeher

mommy called crazy and scorned
cuz she two more born
one boy soon after
the girl much later and
although they were both sung the same lullabies of hate 
herfirst son the first one
whosewomb-world was profaned
came of age playing street games
with stewie rezzie and little brother
till his heart start to wither
in pain and shame
blamed mom for the wrong she let daddy do to her
and him
letsins of the father cause his innocence to wander
found out amongst thieves 
chose to squander his dreams
stopped believing in himself
become prodigal with his life
make impossible shit right with
gang-ties crime lies
erase wise woeful words of mother
replaced them with absurdities of others
who had also lost their way

played a different kind of street game now
first son plunged deep
speak street-family vows
espouse no causes but his own
see he couldnt protect mommys neck from daddys grasp
orprotect mommys ass from daddys wrath
couldnt shield her ears from
daddys foul-mouthed liquor-breath jeers
his only defense-served be confidence
brown bottles housed his swift descent
phones called cops on block frequent for his shenanigans
nowdaddy and him twins in addiction
driven to false-hearted heavens and friends
by liquefied demons
had become what he despised from conception til end
destined for a demise
survived nine lives of staying high
conning jewelry-pawning arrests theft
womanizingonly for money never for sex
bullet in chest baseball bat to the head
left for dead
so eyes wide and glassy
speechslowed and slurred
lips twitched with caked-up codeine candy
and mouth corners one december 24th
mr hide and false friend
took final ride to suburban supplier
shots were fired by the gray man
with shaky hand
but not shaky enough to miss
hitlost boy in back
so-called friend runs for door
leaves first son blood-born
lying alone in blood on cold floor

death was the cost of
returning to innocence lost

baby sis awake for dawn on christmas morn
to mommys sobs and shakes
daddys silhouettes of regret
all past omitted and absolved by lost
as they clung to each other
knowingblack thought

black thought
yo my definition is a lyricist for hire
my vocals a passport that never expire
crowd loud like fifty rounds of gun fire
screamin out the roots while i balance wit the wire
yo expert in this profession the session
in 1987 i linked up wit the uestion
eleven years later we shared crop wit geffen
in musical hell but hip-hop forever heaven
my thoughts interwoven and deep like beethoven
this foul world so filled of shit it like a clogged up colon
swollen wit minds that got stolen
fake-ass cops uncontrollable patrolmen
torture blood flow like bodies of water
fathers sexually assaultin they own daughter
out of sync outta order like a puzzle
in the land of the unseen hand that hold juggle
in a game of life yo its hard to roll a double
tryin times take lives and separate couples
kids thinkin they grown tellin they moms fuck you
under they breath livin in the last times left
peep the imagery strep across the sky like a canvas
and were the artists beneath vigorous rough strokes of darkness
time to set it off lets spark this
switzerland lets spark this
we are the ultimate rock-rockin it
we are the ultimate rock-rockin it
we are the ultimate rock-rockin it rock-rockin it rock-rockin it
we are the ultimate rock-rockin it
we are the ultimate louder rock-rockin it
we are the ultimate
rock-rockin it cmon rock-rockin it cmon rock-rockin it
yo my definition is a lyricist for hire
you couldnt have a clue its about to transpire
the books i buy live arms i wire
the fifth similar to ghetto gospel choir
we ex-plore the whole states plus record
in flight buds trip that was a prisoner in war
four-four the corridor seal it no floor
but i could see the drop was a mile aboard
to the bottom electrical shock for rhymes
i said i dont got em guess it kinda presented a problem
when i understood they said let him go
i woke during a center to london 
and now wit a past fuckin wit border patrol
im findin it out im leakin wit my people
hit the studio spread this information
in daze of frustration fogged the education
&gt;from illa-fifth to switzerland destination
the roots du journ go check the translation
the dictionary of devout topics far from ebonics
the fifth dynast they cant stop it
yo zurlich yall keep it tight heed
while the roots crew smoke weed
yo we are the ultimate rock-rockin it
we are the ultimate say what rock-rockin it
we are the ultimate cmon 
rock-rockin it cmon cmon rock-rockin it rock-rockin it

yo one two one-two one-two
thats how we usually start once again its the thought
the dalai lama of the mic the prime minister thought
this directed to whoever in listening range
yo the whole state of things in the world bout to change
black rain fallin from the sky look strange
the ghetto is red hot we steppin on flames
yo its infliction on a price for fame
and it was all the same but then the antidote came
the black thought ill syllablist out the fifth
this heavyweight rap shit im about to lift
like a phyllum lift up its seed to sunlight
i plug in the mic draw like a gunfight
i never use a cordless or stand applaudless
sippin cholorophyll out of ill silver gauntlet
im like a faucet monopolys the object

yo i walk a-cross this world thats deceptive
beats are perfected the ghettos infested
with more destruction my vocal eruption
was speakin bout corruption with no introduction
approach me with caution cause i spark losses
m-illitant the rap arson marchin
leavin niggaz stiff like im starchin departin
hollywood sambos and jokes just like martin
im the type of nigga that belongs in a ward
with a mic and a cord to hold your head with a sword
some proclaim lames callin theyselves bold
they shall be flawed when the claps applaud
if this a point of life one i cant afford
then i have to get sheist and i deal in fraud
now back to the topic of the rap philosopher
with more drama than a soap opera
who stops the propoganda the hot block commander
puttin a halt to all the backtalk and slander
warn every challenger about the silencer
muzzle in your mouth for the days thats on the calendar

chorus

black thought
im from the valley of the heavyheads watch the ghetto pre-medical
undergrads and steady red faces of stone
eyes are crevices life like a double negative
philly crimin-al i rhyme my dirt tariq already did
buildin this fifth foundation in the wilderness
thought-less trespass and enter thoughts fortress
limitless entrance paid to the order of the
cypher slaughterer my mic slappin you senseless
defenseless niggaz never movin me inches
the beat fifth invisi-ble in the trenches
afficiando awesome hip-hop drug problem
fuck stardom and chickens up in gotham
poltergeist slit or choke the mic til it scream to me
stop that cash we conveniently got that
i stroll through your scenery cocked back
me and hot mack the nine-eight el dorado cadillac jacks

chorusjust think what if you could just just blink yourself away
just think what if you could just just blink yourself away
jeff x can rock the mic with tooth decay
i be the 5 foot 7 residing at the mecca lesson south section
used to cut class in the infinite pursuit of ass
back in eighty-six
easy with the chics i was a chocolate boy
raised in the cellar with the rhythm like ella
walking down the streets to the subway where i lay
til the train stop then a nigga hop
used to do the pop dance to the planet rock
at the block party everybody jocked who me
its the mc sucka niggaz envy
i got my contract in 1993 and 
i shall proceed

chorus repeat 2x

i shall proceed
and continue to rock the mic

verse two

i wake up early in the morning i mean early afternoon
break a lyrical hymn of the stem like boom
im flyer when im higher put my shit up on a tomb
that nigga represented on the 28th of june
im representing philly on the 28th of june
i can make you feel that im a surreal cartoon
with my pistol in the face of hip hop stick in your face
because im on a paper chase yes im on a paper chase
my timberlands are fully laced i be the mr boogeyman 
with records from 125th to japan
i laid them play like johnny hathaway and shake a hand shake a hand
your lady tried to kick it but i couldnt play my man
my niggaz is my niggaz ya see she didnt understand
i shake your hand and shitll hit the fan just think
just think what what if you could just blink what
just blink yourself away

verse three

malik b get on the mic yo theres too much on my mind say what
malik get on the mic theres too much on my mind
johnny on the spot got the rhythm and the rhyme
fuckin with the roots you know them niggaz is the dime
i can make a hundred yard line start to dash
i can make a whole lake of fish start to splash
i can make conan and the titans clash
i can metallica and guns n roses crash
used to smash crash parties like i was disturbed
used to make plots against the herringbone herb
but now all i do disperse the verb
and like a nerd i can make you say hes superb
word is perfect never ever shall you misinterpret
i move styles like bowels so now you know im worth it
direct from philly the lands where niggas scheme
so you know i got the sheen in my gleam

chorus*black thought speaks and makes crowd respond for a minute and 15 sec*

black thought
yo my definition is a lyricist for hire
my vocals a passport that never expire
crowd loud like fifty rounds of gun fire
screamin out the roots while i balance wit the wire
yo expert in this profession the session
in 1987 i linked up wit the uestion
eleven years later we shared crop wit geffen
in musical hell but hip-hop forever heaven
my thoughts interwoven and deep like beethoven
this foul world so filled of shit it like a clogged up colon
swollen wit minds that got stolen
fake-ass cops uncontrollable patrolmen
torture blood flow like bodies of water
fathers sexually assaultin they own daughter
out of sync outta order like a puzzle
in the land of the unseen hand that hold juggle
in a game of life yo its hard to roll a double
tryin times take lives and separate couples
kids thinkin they grown tellin they moms fuck you
under they breath livin in the last times left
peep the imagery strep across the sky like a canvas
and were the artists beneath vigorous rough strokes of darkness
time to set it off lets spark this

yo my definition is a lyricist for hire
you couldnt have a clue its about to transpire
the books i buy live arms i wire
the fifth similar to ghetto gospel choir
we ex-plore the whole states plus record
in flight buds trip that was a prisoner in war
four-four the corridor seal it no floor
but i could see the drop was a mile aboard
to the bottom electrical shock for rhymes
i said i dont got em guess it kinda presented a problem
when i understood they said let him go
i woke during a center to london 
and now wit a past fuckin wit border patrol
im findin it out im leakin wit my people
hit the studio spread this information
in daze of frustration fogged the education
&gt;from illa-fifth to switzerland destination
the roots du journ go check the translation
the dictionary of devout topics far from ebonics
the fifth dynast they cant stop it
yo zurlich yall keep it tight heed

yo
i knew this girl named alana with mad persona
she delt with reality never fed it to the drama
i met her through my nigga named jermaine palmer
who knew her through his peoples by the baltimore harbor
alana was a marylan thurough and attractive
shorty thats relaxed with me and kickin back
wif a phat flick to cool out
was stressed cause the gamell make you wanna pull a tool out
and go the old school route
but all-a that cease - when that piece checkin the jewel out
a bruver was charged - light a spliff and listen to the dabarge
let the shorty hit me wif a massage to annoint
lubricatin my maridian points that was the summer easy to remember
alana was all up on - to read the gender how i used to back bender
she even told her best friend blinda from virginia
who asked me if i had a cousin i could recomend-a
but as time float on we grew more mature - and further apart
when i began to do tours we lost contact
and slowly parted - reminissin of when it started
it keep me feelin heavy hearted - a stolen moment periodic
addicted to her presence like a narcotic
though i wonder if she ever got it - the hypnotic
that faded like a dream sequence that pursuaded
beyond being infatuated - spiritually intoxicated
comps are dated - i concentrated
on how to get in touch with her
cuase the fact of the matter remain that i miss the hypnotic

driftin driftin
the hypnotic the hypnotic
the hypnotic the hypnotic
the hypnotic the hypnotic
the hypnotic the hypnotic
the hypnotic the hypnotic
the hypnotic the hypnotic

driftin ------- driftin

i would begin to dial -
her number but knowin its been awhile its hard to link
i figure what she probly think and soon start to drink
fightin the feelin im concealin apparently i first appealin
later revealin to be deeper - resistance increasingly weaker
the essence of life is more than just mics and puffin reefa
this universe of black thought that i can teach ya
im tryin to touch ya only if i can reach ya
i hit this kid i sign up on his beepa
and ask him if a had a chance to speak ta
jermaine palmer who fathers a preacha
to make the story short me and my man soon ran
into each other von the humble at a show in san fran
i said yo palma when did you last see alana
he offer me a seat and attempts to make me calma
when he began to break it down my mind start to wander
response beyond somber incredible crushed
kinda feelin on my shoulder - that of a boulder
to find out that her life was over - it made the room feel colder
i thought i could get wif her when she was a little older
but she a victim of the wicked system that controlled-a its all chaotic
but if my life its symbolic forever shadow on my mental i never forgot it
yo the psycotic the hypnotic check it out the most melodic hypnotic

we used to live in the same building on the same floor
and never met before until im over seas on tour
and peep this ethiopian queen from philly takin classes abroad
shes studyin film and photo flash focus record
says shes workin on a flick and could my click do the score
she says she loved my show at paris at elyse montmartre
that i stepped off the stage and took a piece of her heart
we knew from the start that things fall apart and tend to shatter
she like that shit dont matter when i get home get at her
through letter phone whatever
lets link lets get together
shit you think not you think that thought went home and forgot
time passed now were back in philly and she up in my spot
tellin me the things im tellin her is makin her hot
started buildin with her constantly round the clock

and keep tellin me

if somethings on your chest then let it be known

and on the topic of trust its just a matter of fact
that people bite back and fracture whats intact
and theyll forever be
i aint on some oh im a celebrity
i deal with the real so if its artificial let it be
i seen people caught in love like whirlwinds
listenin to their squaws and listenin to girlfriends
thats exactly the point where they whole world ends
lies come in and thats where the drama begins

the letters spilled slowly across the page like a world premiere
well i aint the bullshit begins here
the obvious cause the effects is unclear
the punishment for crimes of the heart could be severe
though to keep it on the low is a heavy cross to bear
you deep now submerged with no signs of air
still your sunken heart thumpin like the kick in a snare
while on the surface its all turnin to a circus
thats why youre nervous and you got a right to be
cause if somebody woulda done that shit to me
i mean my best man hittin my wife-to-be
my sentiments exactly would be history
yknow what im sayin my peoples in the place lets hit it off one two

chorus

yo its like nothin changed its all the same thang
the same characters in a book with different names
its a lot more to lose than you got to gain
you a lot more confused than hip to the game
the peep the script of the game the price is pain
men and women get into things now whos to blame
when everybody whisperin bout whatever took place
and how the fact twist a knot with a straight face
and lies hard to swallow from the bitter taste
well thats a point in the past that cant be erased
so motivate though its hard to let it ride
or set aside true feelings underhand dealings
our lost trust i wonder if we lost us
its bigger than me and you its monstrous
so ima just calm down and try to relax
before i clap 

chorus

if you could only flash back and undo our actions
change what happens dissect the fractions
a time to rewind and be recorded absent
for real cause these memories is photographic
pornographic pushing me close to madness
head heavy like im trippin on tablets
yesterday as i recall was all fabulous i thought so
but now it feel like shots hittin my torso
spent a lotta time and trust in the wrong place
fought a lotta fights rollin with the wrong ace
love stronger than pride we could end disgrace
i need room the think and space to ventilate
was solid as a rock shall not disintegrate
thoughts racing like the lunatics on the interstate
for real ya its ill ya my peoples in the place

chorus repeat to end with black thought adlibbingblack thought
well its the raw regees thoroughbred from philly
my name black thought my girls the black lilies
some people try to front like i aint feelin it really
but thats silly cause how the f**k you cant feel me
when i first felt it i knew it had to be dealt wit
alot of ice-grillin in the house got melted
some tried to put up a fight but they was helpless
you aint try to turn that loose you too selfish
gimme that guess who bringin the get busy back
women say the sound of my voice the afrodeziac

e-me and when im in your town come see me
the real world for real this aint your mtv
the illest innervisions since stevie on wax
my vocal like serve-o forty-eight tracks
the fact of the matter is a matter of fact
that its the black thought controllin like ike turner
you wanna get wise you best to be a fast learner
or just relax and peep how its done
and boogie ya ass to whats about to come because

chorusjaguar *singing*

thought second to none nigga

chorus

wall and groovin groovin
weve come to get it kickin and get the movement movin

grown man tactics no pediatrics
the kind of track that make the comeback miraculous
the catalyst thought with the knack for splashin
im dashin i mastered the craft of mashin
the level-headed throughbred the females passion
mag-netic attraction be keepin them askin
the crews in the cadillacs with the pendergrassin 
swerve half-naked wont come near crashin
but if i go to heaven would yall know my name
or would it be the same for you like i was eric clapton huh
clap for you freedom dog thats whats happening

and every word thats understood is a transaction
im an sp soldier microphone holder

paris france to tip and tioga
how we gonna make it through the dark i show ya

chorus black thought &amp; nelly furtado
i tell you one lesson i learned
if you want to reach something in life
you aint gonna get it unless
you give a little bit of sacrifice
ooohh sometimes before you smile you got to cry
you need a heart thats filled with music
if you use it you can fly
if you want to be high

verse two black thought
listen yo kick off your shoes jump off the jock
i fly higher than them dudes from off your block
my name black the style is unorthodox

a couple of people wanted thought to stop but guess what 
my man grab the missile plug for the gut
now next time beatty stop being such a glut
im precise with it like faheim with haircuts
we up close on em with toast but no crust
its fructose on em they froze and wont bust
choke on your face you jewels is lacklust
got to put it to you straight yall fools is jacked up
came close to the upmost but no cigar

the number one runner with the number one drummer
grammy award winnin its the worlds eighth wonder
come on

chorus

verse three black thought
your first impression might be im a asshole
or say im sometimey and give people a hassle
or try to suntouch and put the heat in the capsule
dog im far deeper than that though; i get in the zone
recognize im a rolling stone
no time to lollygag or lounge with scaliwags
give me the disc or i put it where your body at
old school spit flow laid over trotter tracks
with no apology fraud or trick-knowledgy
just trust what i see and i say and follow me my way
i read an open booklet inside me
the star of the story that groove teller got me
through all the dark times part of the business
the light be contingent on small forensics
my microphonell make a man a newborn infant
its true so the crew gon sense it
i get in the zone

draw you in close and make you wanna listen to it
and if you real ill at makin music
the listna gonna feel like he living through it
thats how my nigga do it
i met slacks back in like ninety-one rappin
we went to millersville to get away from gun clappin
it aint last i be in class dreaming bout fifty-thousand fans up in the stands
screaming out
encore yo im heading back to philly nigga you rollin with me
im tryna get busy
we walked dogs that was off the chain lotta times at the shows people hardly
came
i just took it in stride as a part of the game but inside
people down with me started to change
it was a couple thangs little syrup little pills
instead of riding out on the road youd rather chill
i know the way the pleasure feels im not judgin
but still im on a mission yo im not buggin
i got fam that cant stop druggin they cant sleep
they cant stick to one subject and cant eat
its people steady comin at me out in the street
like riq yo what up with ya peeps it gets deep nigga

chorus
yo you need to walk straight masta ya high
son you missing out on whats passin ya by
i done see these streets suck a lotta cats dry
but not you and i my nigga
we got to get
cmon over over the water x2
yo water x2

we done been through many meals a couple of deals
we done share clothes and wheels killed mics and reels
we done rocked shows abroad and slept on floors
trying to figure what the fuck we gettin slept on for
or what we walkin with the weapon for
weighted by the gravity law you know it if you came up poor my nigga
picture the bus up north
you know we made of errething outlaws are made of
im far from a hata and i dont say i love you cause the way i feel is
greater
m-illa you a poet son you a born creator
and thisll probably dawn on you later
its in your nature lyrics all up on you walls like they made of paper
you gotta follow where the talent take ya
ya might fuck around and finally make it and thats real but yo

chorus

i want ya all to understand i come from south philly
and when i walk the streets its like a pharmacy
they got all type-a shit anybody can get
it go from h to x to loosie cigarettes
for my ghetto legend known for little shiest runnin
cop codine by the quarts and keep comin dumbin
just embracing the dope like its a woman
ya burning both sides of the rope and just pullin tuggin
in between islam and straight thuggin
layin everyday around the way and doin nothin
see em lookin shakin their heads and start shruggin
if they dont got a man like mine they gotta cousin
an yo you better be a true friend to him 
before the shit put an end to him
or give a pen to him
and lock him in the studio with a mic
cause on the real it might save his life
keep tellin himchorus
dont stop uh dont stop yo
tonight cheeba cheeba yo soul shock yo
give it everything you got yo
once again its time its time
its time to ride ride

verse one black thought
yo piss in the staircase blood on the pavement
i fill the quills with it let it spill on the pages
compose another anthem for the killers and manglers
villains and wranglers fifth still in the chamber
shit im scientific but my reflexs gangsta
pull out-rageous arms from the floor of the basement
then bust nuff talons if my peoplez in danger
im larry davis duckin helicopter hoverin government agents
we muscle the language
what we spit will leave your shit in utter amazement
im hot brolic call it contagious
the shit the roots started got these other artists going through changes
my vision is the strangest the rhythm is anguish
yall niggaz on the titty in your formative stages
is something in the iris and the way i spit
that tell these other crab rappers i aint fo no shit
black traumatic so there you have it
my battin average abort full of graphic assault its all classic
thought put ass-backwards rappers in a small package
experience is all that is im well established
me and the mic in holy matrimony like a marriage
the technique in your reach if only you could have it
for me its automatic its na-tu-ral im mad thoro
poet for hired pack metal
you feel me

chorus

verse two black thought
yo the load heavy
we walk around a little edgy all ready and steady
withdrawal like darryl strawberry it figures
niggaz mad from them ghetto sandwiches and swine
cryin hard times disadvantegeous man listen
the story in the ghetto the same
seem like its just some things that never will change
give birth to a style and wont give it a name
talk bout consciousness its a different thang
envision again the honorable riq general hannibal speak
the understandable diabolique animal style
out of your dreams kid you proud that you seen this
fifth supreme linguist a lyrical genious
inject you with the broke down english
the most freshest and cleanest three gs guess what the fame is
kareems beat makin me fiendish
dont act shaky and squeamish if you real make me believe it nigga

chorus

verse three black thought
yo the rebel che guevara
you felt another date you better
dont copped off create it just save your cheddar
i hit the studio with a pen and a vendetta
sippin an ice cold beck huffin the tenth letter
driftin shots lickin while the plot thickens
sands in the hourglass thinnin the last inning
the flash and the cash and the fast women
its nothing a lust for the crabs keep the passion and
blaow kissin my tablet with firing pins
poke holes in the plastic for oxygen
mcs jumpin out shoes and socks again
must have seen their face in the news its gots to been
thought known as the cure for cancer
same corrupt city as mumia the panther
man to man hammer cocked block and standoff
bang gunfire slang up in the dance hall
yo i hold the mic that could be thrown as a pipe bomb
bring it just to sling it at your favorite icon
thing about my music is it aint shit like yall
thought diesel like a 28-inch python
you know what im saying

when im on the mic there wont be no delayin

chorusdancin on the dance floor
girl its you that i adore
step on stage and scream for more
all i see pussy galore
snap my fingers make you mine
if not ill snap a 2nd time
after that i guarantee you will be standing next to me

an old head once said thats more power for the cocaine freaks dancing on 
line like soul train
to give your product that extra push
niggas lookin for the time of their life coppin a rush
yo i know sis dog her name lorraine
she that thick brick house with the chocolate frame
i went to school with her 12th grade i used to fool with her
she put me on with her squad i got cool with her

she useta say she wanna be a doctor and couldnt nothing stop her from giving 
up that cash for tuition even if
she had to shake that ass
fucked up her money aint accumulate that fast
lorraine know its real and sex control america
turn the tv its in the open on the regular yo
what the freaks in the video for
fuck a song give me a thong and pussy galore

chorus
you see lifes about marketing and pussy galore
every time i turn around its more pussy galore
nations goin to war for the pussy galore
either the cash the raw or the pussy galore
yo gang wars more pussy galore
from the streets to the record store
every time i turn around its more pussy galore
either the cash the raw or the pussy galore

yo desire and lust can make a man kill
or jump off a bridge cuffed to a muthafuckin anvil
so its promoted like thats all yawl know
keep a nigga under the spell you under control
but yo i seem to make people slit they wrists
weakness pussy make a spots they secrets
but what for cause sex is the law law
and done been many an empire rise and fall
from the squares to the players to the pimps and whores
to big checks that never would have been endorsed
you know i just sit back and just peep things
9 out of 10 its the same song only the beat changed
so dont be looking at tariq strange
when i conduct a little litmus test up in your heat range
thats when you see me on stage with 6 
wicked ass chicks
finna get crunk with this

chorus

fresh cut with the thick black velour
with the black louis sneaks
headin out for tour
looking out the limo window up at the billboards
for 200 miles she was the only thing i saw
promoting everything from the liquor to the nicotine
cell phones antihistamine chicken wings
you gotta show a little skin to get them listening for real
yawl know the world is a sex machine
full of pretty freaks in designer jeans
who go to extremes to conjure all kinds of schemes
half the time it aint even responsibly
trying to take me somewhere i aint tryna be
ghetto sin city where the p is free
you catch a bid far worser than a 1 to 3
all up in the after hours on the 2nd floor
for that good thang that keep em comin back for more

ive been wondering about the complexity 
of what we have it shouldnt be
more

black thought
youre physically in this but how can we tell
if we was meant to be in bliss if youre not mentally as well
this energy youre sending me is tricky as hell
usually its like a 50/50 we can take an l
before we start things
at this point being apart brings
the feeling of somebody plucking at your heart-strings
i know it probably shouldnt feel like this
but any other woman i see is in your likeness
its from your cheekbones
to your lips
to your curves
to your deep moans
to that walk
to your words
your love feelin like a breakdown on the verve
first we on good terms then youre on my last nerve
got my back just aching
my shoes is all tight
its too complex when we choose to do it right
its wrong
one minute you a soldier - strong
then you turn around talking bout its over and gone
i swear to god

when your boyfriends in town its bound to be trouble love
his name black and he known to be a lover of
gettin it on with my smokers jacket on
eyes racin back and forth
listening to chaka kahn
tryin to 
figure the cause
why you always hackin off
like im slackin off
maybe our signals getting crossed
what the case love
you feel like you makin a waste of
your precious time - you need to get a taste of
some space to breathe a moment as friends
we shoulda felt ourselves slippin into it again
cuz its like
off and on on and off
passion - lost and found found and lost
clashin askin for nothing but understanding
your hearts made of glass use care in handling
girl - all-in-all i never leave you stranded
cuz my respect you commanded
you figure it out

i used to come into the party
and stand around
cuz i was kinda too shy to really get down
i used to play the corner
and watch the scene
deep down knowing i wanted to find me a queen
and i can feel that in my stomach
and up in my chest
because i knew a lot of women and some was fresh
but then i found you girl and just like me
you had a heart that was yearning to be set free
now listen
see you and me need to take the time
to erase any doubt thats inside your mind
its not a mountain that im ever too tired to climb
and whos counting - but i know at least a thousand times
i let you know im here for you care for you and confide in you
break bread share with you and provide for you
and thats full time - its no 9 to 5 with you
thats why im tryin to work it out with you
lets go

something in the way of things
something that will quit and wont start
something you know but cant stand
cant know get along with
like death
riding on top of the car peering through the windshield for his cue
something entirely fictitious and true
that creeps across your path hallowing your evil ways
like they were yourself passing yourself not smiling
the dead guy you saw me talking to is your boss
i tried to put a spell on him but his spirit is illiterate

i know things you know and nothing you dont know
cept i saw something in the way of things
something grinning at me and i wanted to know was it funny
was it so funny it followed me down the street
greeting everybody like the good humor man
but an they got the taste of good humor but no ice cream
it was like dat
me talking across people into the houses
and not seeing the beings crowding around me with ice picks
you could see them
but they looked like important negroes on the way to your funeral
looked like important jiggaboos on the way to your auction
and let them chant the number and use an ivory pointer to count your teeth
remember steppen fetchit
remember steppen fetchit how we laughed
an all your sunday school images giving flesh and giggling
with the ice pick high off his head
made ya laugh anyway

i can see something in the way of our selves
i can see something in the way of our selves
thats why i say the things i do you know it
but its something else to you
like that job
this morning when you got there and it was quiet
and the machines were yearning soft behind you
yearning for that nigga to come and give up his life
standin there bein dissed and broke and troubled

my mistake is i kept sayin that was proof that god didnt exist
and you told me nah it was proof that the devil do
but still its like i see something i hear things
i saw words in the white boys lying rag
said he was gonna die poor and frustrated
that them dreams walk which you cross town
sgonna die from over work
theres garbage on the street thats tellin you you aint shit
and you almost believe it
broke and mistaken all the time
you know some of the words but they aint the right ones
your cable back on but aint nothin you can see
but i see something in the way of things
something to make us stumble
something get us drunk from noise and addicted to sadness
i see something and feel something stalking us
like and ugly thing floating at our back calling us names
you see it and hear it too
but you say it got a right to exist just like you and if god made it
but then we got to argue
and the light gon come down around us
even though we remember where the light or mic is
remember the negro squinting at us through the cage
you seen what i see too
the smile that aint a smile but teeth flying against our necks
you see something too but cant call its name

aint it too bad yall said
aint it too bad such a nice boy always kind to his motha
always say good morning to everybody on his way to work
but that last time before he got locked up and hurt real bad
i seen him walkin toward his house and he wasnt smiling
and he didnt even say hello
but i knew hed seen something
something in the way of things that it worked on him like it do in will
and he kept marching faster and faster away from us
and never even muttered a word
then the next day he was gone
you wanna know what
you wanna know what im talkin about
sayin i seen something in the way of things
and how the boys face looked that day just before they took him away
the is in that face and remember now remember all them other faces
and all the many places youve seen him or the sister with his child
wandering up the street
remember what you seen in your own mirror and didnt for a second recognize
the face your own face
straining to get out from behind the glass
open your mouth like you was gon say somethin
close your eyes and remember what you saw and what it made you feel like
now dont you see something else
something cold and ugly
not invisible but blended with the shadow criss-crossing the old man
squatting by the drug store at the corner
with is head resting uneasily on his folded arms
and the boy that smiled and the girl he went with

and in my eyes too
a waving craziness splitting them into the jet stream of a black bird
wit his ass on fire
or the solomnotness of where we go to know we gonna be happy

i seen something
i seen something
and you seen it too
you seen it too
you just cant call its name name name name name name nameound sound bombing bombing

[light faded voice of black thought]
cause when i put rhymes in they minds yo
for all yall folks who were hopin and wishin
and i can assault tryina take my position
stop wishin and sit yourself back and listen to
ayo cause when i put rhymes in they minds yo
for all yall folks who were hopin and wishin

when i say rise up yall say now

[verse 1 black thought]
ayo everybody on they jawns
cartoons is hardcore porn
it aint no afterschool paper routes and mowin lawns
kids got backpacks full of yayo and heron
coming to school shootin up the auditorium
yo its anthrax maniacs on the tv
the least of yall worries should be thoughts cd
the chairman of the board coppin twice weekly
they done caught the minister with a pork blt
if my shit aint hot it probly try to drive me
psyhce its somethin i can never let myself see
cant see im thorough-bread nothin fancy
the maker no matter what the circumstance be
its the principle pillowcase full of nickel
smacked like im  leave him crippled
keep talkin greasey ima big lip you
ayo your manll can get slid with you
you and the squad takin to galoshes
i hold the engineer for hostage
and spit from a dirty cartridge
its l for whoever try to front on thoughts shit
im sendin them goons to your moms apartment

[chorus]

[verse 2 dice raw]
ayo im dancin on the edge of insanity
and rhymin like its the end of humanity
still people from the old neighborhood cant stand to see me
turn around and tell girls we like family
what up with all that jokin and collamity
behind the laughter they thinkin about jammin me
but they dont know i got somethin for them
but i aint with that negative vibe so fuck all that
ive earned alot from this game and sacrificed more
stand here a new man but im still the old boy
they claimin they sell but im still the old boss
sometimes wings get clipped we all hit the floor
but today though its black thought kweli and raw
you can be sure that we got our eyes on yall
watchin different artists rise and fall
mother fuckers jumpin ship like we came to rob at yall

[chorus]

[verse 3 talib kweli]
kweli sittin back in the cut like reese
in a constant peace call me fantastic like i cut the grease
baracudas movin and canoein sippin amaretto
im a ruler of my temple what i do to instrumentals
instrumentals is the development of these niggas mentals
tears in your eyes like this moment is sentimental
your fundamentally floored philosophically bored
disturbed like the eighth floor of your hospital ward
youve got to appoint niggas to raise the bar
muslims praise allah christians praise the god
rastas they say jah
they find a way to rhyme with the pallet like fine wine
and make you say ahhh
guess whos back
the game needed improvement
cant fit the bullshit no more you sound stupid
im a shark in the water with constant movement
influenced by music since a truant yo
this is how we do it yo

[chorus x2]40 seconds of instrumental to start

black thought
get em up high - okay yeah

chorus
go all-star and get down for yours
to the ladies in the house be proud of yours
you got the roots crew with the sound of course
high lift em up high okay

black thought
when that adrenaline get in they system
it get em out on a quest for stardom could be a motherf**kin problem
in philly cincinatti los angeles or harlem
kids call theyself killers let they hammers do the talkin
dont even know the meaning of life aint seen a thing
and you dream of floodin the scenery with llello and greenery
but for now you stickin her with the heavy machinery
wonder how you lift it up be only 17
and like erybody he wanna shine young brothers on the grind
holdin somethin in they spine bowling for columbine
stressin to me how its all about a dollar sign
dig the way you out of line out of sight and out of mind
up against the clock and damn near out of time
the tipping point has arrived and thats the bottom line
to all my peoples thats stars its our time to shine
lets get em up high cmon

chorus - 2x

black thought
yo aint it strange how the newspapers play with the language
im deprogrammin yall with uncut slang shit
i know some peoples in the party armed and dangerous
twist some cool champagne im goin through changes
a grown-ass man i done paid my dues
learn the rules lil homey you could be one too
niggaz know aint no tellin what he gon do
but recognize young bruh ima do it for you
you know why we all stars and we highly evolved
hip-hop its not pop like kylie minogue
if it bang them gettin-busy brothers probably involved
in the game where erybody got a shottie to draw
i guess you probably a thug you boss ballin or what
i cant call it man i got the ladies fallin in love
cause handsome intelligent tough - im all the above
i know you knew it its the movement
groove to it while you doin it up

chorus - 2x w/ minor variations

black thought
introducin the band you gotta see to believe
he got the mic in his hand so keep the heat up your sleeve
its black thought he rockin sharp so the speakersll bleed
i run a triathalon you wouldnt see me fatigued
im a star and maybe yall should cop somethin to be
or trade some of yall equipment in for somethin you need
cause its a lot of bullshit floodin the scene
where erybodys a star and hot shit is few and far between
we lose the grip of what garbage mean
shorties wanna be theyself i know its hard to be
dont wanna do the ruben studdard and come off less threatenin
keepin it realll kill you if you end up lettin it
aint it blowin your mind how the game all in line
now the best to the rest we fin to end up settin it
id tell you that i was a veteran but its evident
you act like you want it you gon end up gettin it

chorus - 3x w/ minor variations

everybody is a star

echoes and fades into an instrumental that ends the songchorus sung 2x 
i dont care as long as the basslines pumpin 
the drumline bangin away 
make one move and ill blow you away 
one false move and ill blow you away 

black thought 
yo - i dont really know but somebody said 
that the og flow it could f**k witcha head 
and the po-lice know that the green black and red 
too strong to con-trol they study what i said 
dig it - my name is riq and when im on the mic 
im known to spit somethin that these mcs hate 
i couldnt care less what you feel what you say 
cause i gotta put it to you in my own special way - im a 
monster 
you know im certified sick 
i came from the corner where nobody got shit 
took the cards i was dealt turned it into hot spit 
now im not only a passenger im in the cokpit 
been a long time comin i was caught in the scramble 
of cats tryin to do the same thing that they man do 
eagles born to fly real is made to ramble 
a dangerous mind im a prime example 

chorus 

black thought 
superfans wanna run up on me sparkin the ground up 
you need to fall back could be narcs around us 
you in a hot area for marchin powder 
if you holdin chowder just walk without it 
them real crook brothers dont talk about it 
they never make a move til they thought shit out kid 
i knew a lot of men who did bids for mayhem 
they made a lot of money they money never made them 
the game of survival is filled with rivals 
knives and fo-five slugs flyin in spirals 
the wicked is diseased and it aint all viral 
could be greed and gluttony bubblin inside you 
dawg follow your pride the rhythmll guide you 
yo follow them guys them niggazll rob you 
and have you up in somethin that dont really involve you 
but you dont give a f**k you wanna pump the volume i know 

chorus 

black thought 
yo aiyyo the waistline thumpin the face kinda jumpin the game 
lookin sweeter than a bassline bumpin 
dont come round me sparks and waste time frontin 
them trick ass marksll get the eight-five dumpin 
it aint really bout nothin - philly just love cuttin 
they shut shit down before the law start shuttin 
get your route right cousin - be out nightclubbin relaxed 
and wanna get lights out tonight brother perhaps 
its the percussion that keeps shit kinetic 
for some it aint as fame more sweet the street credit 
some cats that play dirty didnt live to regret it 
but move to the music he can live through the record 
im a philly boss player a dope rhyme sayer 
its black ink back gettin cake by the layer 
by the stack comin at us get your weight right yeah 
if not you makin a mistake right there freal 

chorus - 2xverse 1 - black thought
yeah that all mighty amazing ill highly contagious
kamikaze south splash like it shot from a gauge
until your body sound clash
head of the class magna cum laude
beats bring the beast out me flagrant - foul rowdy
reed pipe but deed tight disposition keep on flipping
keep em playing they position
keep making the people listen what i spin
put em out on a limb
got tears got blood got sweat leaking out of the pen
yall fake niggas not setting a trend
we never listen to them
its like trying to take a piss in the wind
my home team doing visitors in yo dont test em
they all standing close to the edge so dont stress em
now who the type built to last
its no question the master
villain in black wit no stets in my sound
hitting you hard from - every direction
your head and shoulder area your midsection dawg

chorus
yeah when the saint on the ground 
with the grind on rhyme
with the niggas who grind with king kong hitting thailand 
give it here and dont say nuthin 
just give it here and dont say nuthin
when the team on the set hit the gun gonna clap
git it down on recordhey hmmmm cut the check 
give it here and dont say nuthin 
give it here and dont say nuthin come on

verse 2 - black thought
yeah illadel home of the original gun clappers
out on the wrong corner your shitll get spun backwards
you got the fool wanting the rules enter at risk
or your own nanall keep a gat under the matress
shorties running reckless from philly to texas
suprising what niggas willing to do to get a neckless
some emotions felt better left unexpressed at times
niggas crime record longer than a guest list
yes i done seen things you wouldnt believe
seen people reach levels thought theyd never achieve
silhouettes waiting in the wings ready to d
thirst decise or need at least a buck to breathe
cmon stick up kids they be out to tax
most times they be sticking you without the gats
ill still be on the grind when it all collapse
and if its my worst bar then im a take it right back nigga

chorus

verse 3 - black thought
yeah it aint nothin like i rush i get in front of the band
on stage wit the planet in the palm of my hand
when a brother transform from aynonomous man
to the force crush whoever might of thought i was playin
ima flame some sentence the shit the cold twist to slang
thicker than big boy baby mom sister pain
beyond measure relaxed under pressure
you see the master piece but to me its unperfected
give it here geffen records im off the handle
cut the check and yo it better be as heavy as anvil
next joint comin all bets is cancelled
nigga black ink red was a g finacial
we finna have the whole industry at a stand still
see me put the system on lock like can pill
so get wit them endorsements and call reinforcements
cause my click come a full sizeable portions

chorusyeah it would be cool it could be too
stop running round in circles off of what we fuel
living a lie eventually believing its true
a lot of people here for us one could be you
its outrageous and they just aint nothing
but save us an ocean of brown fists in various flavors
a favor for a favor man this is the majors
tell me what you would do with no phone or pagers
no kinkos no fed ex and no atms
what you gon do when the police state begin
well it already began but i guess it depends on whats really going on
whats happening huh
military target practicing
they finna write another patriot act again
the days is short the nights is long
the fight goes on
the pistols and the pipes are drawn

hook
the middle of the night
we fight like barbarians
in sight of the former might
you might think that its a waste
of our time
and i think you would be right
till he drop that rhyme
repeat

and some might say that its a waste of time
cause aint no amount of dancing finna break the bondage
we go to war and transcend space and time
when every record aint a record just to shake behinds
you know the stakes is high we in the face of drama
thats why we cant shake it or escape the problem
its like a game of roulette the barrel revolving
they only wanna see us occupying a coffin
mothers crying too often from they lost child leaving
from trying to get over get under get even
get inside getting getting dumped getting greedy
we got to get it right
it aint about to be easy
you better pull you goggles up its about to get greasy
believe its on as long as we can still speak freely
pages of my life would make it hard to read me
i know my people hearing me holler if yall need me

repeat hook

the man at hand that rule the school
and reach and teach the blind and find a way from a to z
and be the most to boast the loud and proud
the game and reign that remain
the heat is on so feel the fire come off the empire or the
more higher level of depth one step beyond dope
to suckers all scope and hope to cop a note
cause i could never let em on top of me
i play em out like a game of monopoly
let it speed around the board like an astro
and send them to jail for tryna pass go
shaking them up
breaking them up
taking no stuff
but it still aint loud enough
so quest love let the fire roast
so i can flow and we can kill the whole show cause

repeat hook

im live
design a finer rhyme thats right on time
one step beynd and not behind the line
that seperates thought from divine
you can take it as a caution or a warning sign
look for antonyms
words im sending em
homonyms synonyms good like m&amp;ms
you know the time when its riq gees slicing
i turn a mics last name into tyson
my brain like a factory constantly creating
materials stitch by stitch for decoration

you could lick a million shots at the character of the body shell
theyll just richochette nigga auras hard as hell
before there was aint hard to tell
the mics cycle coincided right with mine as well
since a minor i walked with the spine upstraight
i learned to rhyme to feed the dinner plate
i scraped barrel - even dined up on wine and steaks
cuz in the bone same marrow that apartheid chased
the narrow margin with the haves and the have nots
will get smaller as i approach - so watch your stash box
fox logo if your fave is local
get bruised till youre the color of the lakers logo
this is work niggas

repeat hook

mac

niggas celebrating not knowing the time they wasting
killin mics is one of my aesthetics

the profit on kill if you let it
niggas feeling energetic

so push another slice into your toast and tighten your vests
cause its a warrior you seein here tonight in the flesh

re-gees refugees not another man takin us under
nigga please which philly cat doin his own thing

black one man army move in on your squadron
you sittin still you know you a target
you heard you better duck down

black thought
yea we gettin set to get rid of yall thats what its headin for
the underdog knuckle and brawl with the bigger ball
i spit what your wig absorb sicker than sycamore
im creatin a circumstance that you a victim of
the rebel or the renegade out on the quest
the super black man runnin wit a s on his chest
and stand for the straight struggle to escape the stress
you think its sweet tryin to eat you aint taste this yet
so make yall steps precautious into the darkness
thoughts cold and heartless makin me nauseous
gettin more remorses for what i done
if the lawyers and courts wonder what i run
civil liberties is free but just for some
how you a gangster and you scared to bust your gun
for the call trust your fam and trust nobody at all
seein brothers gettin struck down
you better duck downi dance on grey skulls
of just hipocrites
on my shoulders i carry
the globe full of pools

i devour my own trails
on which my homunculus hans
the comet shot out of my brain
will not reach the borders of the space

crowds of idiots trample down
my pregnant pituitary gland
i weep over my loneliness
surrounded by my friends

i must laugh at the kindness
of my mortal enemies
i open my inward mind
for the icy breath of the endless existence

i want to change into an icicle
of the universal reason
my heart turned to stone
together with the testicles of the life

thousands of hammers hitting the anvil
of my dark destiny
why billion of nothingyo momma

dreams when m16s with infrared beams 
blowin up presidents cribs with cans of kerosene 
highjack the limousine with a strategic routine 
then blast my enemys head for the caribbean 
militant guerilla camp is ready for war 
lay your corner face down place down your jewels cash &amp; 44
when i score prepare for toture 
fuck around &amp; make your town warsaw 
im from illadel the land where the killers dwell 
my technique is to ambush you guerilla style 
my instinct is of a killer whale bang you up from head to toe 
with lyrics i pack like a 9 millimal 
my types subliminal mentality switched to criminal 
importing heroin internash from senegal 
a soldier takes a stripes from a general 
used the mike of iron or led 
you choose your mineral 

this is a game

[verse 1 black thought]
yo in the land of the unseen hand that hold trouble 
theorize your game - its difficult to roll a double 
the struggle aint right up in your face its more subtle 
but its still comin across like the bridge &amp; tunnel vision 
i try to school these bucks but they dont wanna listen 
thats the reason the system makin its paper from the prison 
and thats the reason we livin where they dont wanna visit 
where the dope slang &amp; keep swayin like sonny liston 
the money missin &amp; its mouths to feed 
get the brain kickin thinkin of a thousand things 
remember back in the days when the kitchen had eggs 
and pancakes thickenin greens and kool aid 
when the ‘fridgerator naked then the cupboard is bare 
people got to strip naked stick ‘em up in the air 
was it lies when they told you wasnt nothin to fear 
somethin dont feel right out here you know what im sayin check it out

[chorus]
it dont feel right it dont feel right 
it dont feel it dont feel i cant feel it no more 
it dont feel right it dont feel right 
it dont feel it dont feel i cant feel it no more 
seems to me now a days things have changed 
i dont know if i feel the same

[verse 2 black thought]
look my eyes open ‘cause im really a watchman
and when im writin my thoughts out really im boxin 
my main adversary in this silly concoction 
freeze your face like bosilium toxin
if you aint tryin to get popped then give me a option 
helicopters choppin from philly to compton 
the jones the richardsons the smiths &amp; the johnsons 
if you aint sayin nothin you the systems accomplice 
it should play with your conscience do away with the nonsense 
im overseein anything within my circumference 
this aint a press junket i aint seekin responses 
i stand where the people got the heat in they pocket 
you mezmerized by the calm nonchalant-ness 
i spit a dark web on some john hitchcock shit 
if you aint speakin your life your rhymes adopted 
if it dont feel right then stop it you know what im sayin 

it dont feel right it dont feel right 
it dont feel it dont feel i cant feel it no more 
it dont feel right it dont feel right 
it dont feel it dont feel i dont feel it no more 
things dont feel right over here 
lately i aint been seein clear 
it dont feel right it dont feel right 
it dont feel it dont feel i cant feel it no more 
it dont feel right it dont feel right 
it dont feel it dont feel i cant feel it no more

a few stacks be the price for a nigga head 
cops &amp; robbers cowboys &amp; indians 
clips &amp; revolvers &amp; georges &amp; benjamins 
a celebration of the loss of your innocence 
to your old self youve lost any resemblance

the youth just lost &amp; they want direction 
but they dont get the police they get the protection 
&amp; walk around with heat like charlton heston man

where the expectancy rate be 28 around 
downtown battleground where cops parade around 
have your whole view of life beyond jaded 
how everybody sick of breakin down tryin to make it out 
hand over fist the only way to get the paper down 
people tired of gettin pushed around gettin gangsta now 
discipline the only way to bring some kinda change around 
chain cirgarette smokins with bad nerves 
&amp; brothers with bad lungs from smokin mad herb 
whoever in the dark is unseen &amp; heard 
lets submerge i can feel something close we on the verge 
talkin about to my street sweepers hotel housekeepers 
&amp; my people spillin this out through jail house speakers 
some people rather use than might than use heaters 
some people rather lose they life than lose freedom

&amp; ill be shoutin it too as if a shoutll count 
yo they got accountin to do reamount the ballot 
the shit more puzzlin than a jigsaw 
raw pitbulls hustlin through the pitfall
some of yalls toys let the laughter rip roar 
heart felt truth in every lyric i spit forth 
raise up time to lift off 
written on a lega pad poetry that sizzle the clip board

slow down when your hittin them corners
fuck around spill this gnac on my $200 suit
stop being a backseat driver man

your ma dont like to jitterbug said this unholy music
hip-hop just so ridiculous everything sounds so confusin
nowadays aint nothin like it was
one thing thats sure the blues is
this system so mysterious cant let that stop the movement
cant get no satisfaction
they all laughin
glad its happened
all wings hot for the main attraction
actin a fool with a lust for action
young girl caught in a crime of passion
sittin there cryin in designer fashion;
didnt blow didnt have time for askin
somebody call for the ambulance

[chorus]
baby baby baby
baby let me live please girl let me slide
baby baby baby
baby if you let me go i swear ill change

your old man dont like to jitterbug said this old dirty music
hip-hop just so ridiculous them stories too confusin
nowadays he aint lovin you like he was
and you aint there just for usin
could have sworn that was him with another girl;
and they wasnt out just for cruisin
cant get no satisfaction
he out late nights probably smashin
leavin a trail like charlie tracks
on the train on the ground downtown manhattan
everybody seen him run around and you bound to catch him
the condoms you found and asked him was all this just for practice
he didnt realize what he had
now your heart got fractured

[chorus]
baby baby baby
baby let me live please girl let me slide
baby baby baby
baby if you let me go i swear ill change
just change your mind[x2]

they swore id fall or be another brick in the wall 
another life full of love that lost 
thats silly this philly
yall really aint stoppin the boy
with the pen like willy on top of the hall 
pure soul what the city most popular for 
hear the tones that will ease you 
smooth as bunny siglers soundtrack 
keepin your head boppin and all 
and its somethin in the water though
/where i come from 
they used to sing it on the corner yo
where i come from 
makin somethin outta nothin 
because everybody 50 cents away from a quarter 
where i come from 
yeah the streets aint timid but i feel at home in it 
gotta see a couple people i aint got at in a minute 
yeah you can take a brother outta south philly

listenin to ultramagnetic ego trippin you wont 
pressure my word im the urban vision of you chump 
stomped on a different ground sound second to none 
synthesizers tweet to improvise your feet 
i calculated every lyric to arrive on beat 
its free come get high on me 
before a 9 millimeter shell hit my pelle pelle in the p
yeah its somethin in the water though 
where i come from 
they used to sing it on the corner though 
where i come from 
makin somethin out of nothin 
because everybody 50 cents from a quarter 
where i come from 
its just a natural reaction for crack to make it happen 
let the pen ink sink into the paper of the pad 
think back hen i was younger 
ghetto could have took me under 
young peedi cant mess with north philly 
never had you dont know about me

clap to the record spinnin while im takin you back 
to the top paper era baby dig on that 
picture the pool room where the money getters was at 
and street people with the feathers in the cap of their bossolino 
pullin paper in as if its a small casino 
i was a young boy sweepin the floors and runnin to stores 
but all those old heads would talk to me though
about the way to clutch the eagle on a buck and tuck 
and if im down how to get back up just survival kid
and its the struggle worldwide im positive 
shit the ghetto might as well be the gaza strip 
you know where all of the monsters is
you dont see no consciousness
street walkers
im comin back to where the core of the problem is 
we on the job again yall know what time it is

it aint nowhere to run it aint hardly nowhere to hide 
they hear you when you whisperin so try to keep quiet 
you dont even realize that yous a twinkle in the all seein eye 
from the time you in the bar gettin high 
to havin conversations on your phone through the wire 
you can drive but its definitely footage of your ride 
livin in this day &amp; time its a funny kind of vibe 
from the corners of the ceilin feel its eyes in back of me 
i couldnt tell you why i think they constantly after me 
maybe its cause the news put it to me so graphically 
how niggas dont obey no laws not even gravity boy 
no benefit of doubt he had to be from

to yall its a shame but life is what we know it as 
waitin navigatin the plot without plans 
in the cards its hard to read as a clock with no hands 
how your mans gon get up &amp; stop with no yams

whether sinnin or not my back bendin like im sentenced alot

searchin for somehow to find a minute or the second now 
precious time is money that i aint got to mess about 
need it from the horses mouth or from my eye with less account 
lessons with my back to the wall scopin my session out 
stay a little edgy at times when i aint stressin about 
haters dont know shit about me they the ones that talk shit 
those that love me send it out so i aint got to force quit 
cause im doin better now dont mean i never lost shit 
i was married to a state of mind &amp; i divorced it man 
im from where brothers movin product from the porches 
people lockin they doors clutchin to their crosses

he just attracted to scam he right back in the can 
im never sleepwalkin you dig

im on the first thing in im leavin on the red-eye 
my brother back in rehab just had another relapse 
within himself its like he been fightin an inner jihad 
tellin me aint nobody true when they pretend to be that 
so closer than friends thats where i keep my enemy at

until were able to grow forever bridges we burn

in front of an audience that never been pleased
im comin from all the streets that never been cleaned
&amp; speakin for any faith that never been seen
this debonair style of my words is high-calibre
speakin my mind for every day thats on the calendar
cause done been quiet about as long as i can handle it
walked a mile in these boots that im standin in
mellow soul brother with his lyrical dean on

when its all full of soul thats when it mean more

you know a lot of leaders aint honest
and they cant keep a promise
and i hate to speak about it

treadin water tryin lift up your head without drownin
this type of shit can make ya heart stop poundin
but you pushin for the top too scared to stop

the television gettin all the information wrong
doin how they do it gettin they miseducation on

full of tunnels and changes
i aint gonna front
ask my 5 year old son what he want
he said he want the world to know what his name is
i said be smart boy
and told him he should follow his heart
cause if you tryng to run from it its dangerous
we livin in a era where the people is shameless
they onna do whatever for the paper you name it

look everybody wanna get nice
but every thing come at a price right
errbody got their own price
thats something i learned
when peole too nice
its something that they want in return
a lot a times out of ten
what they wannting is yearn
or they just a little concerned
of something to burn
people talk about respect
thats something thats earned
people that dont wanna give it when they know its deserved
but its real hot
and that kinda life they want it now
when the wheel starts spinning
its tough to slow it down black 
wanna get the people involved
and show em how
if they dont wanna tell you the truth 
you know it now
its bout life 
pressing in persuit of that paper
and people worldwide on their worst behavior
and folks that was never really movers and shakers 
gettin anxious
suddenly they wanna be gangsta

every anywhere; heights plains peaks and valleys
entrances exits vestibules and alleys
winding roads that test the firm nerve
fortune or fatal behind the blind curve
the engine oil purr lights flash to a blur
speed work through the earth make your motor go skrrt
tonight at noon watch a bad moon risin
identities in crisis and conflict diamonds blindin
staring at lights till they cryin
bone gristle poppin from continuous grindin
grapes of wrath in a shapely glass
ingredients influential on your ways and acts
zero tolerance to raise the tax

and its hard to claim the land when my great-great-great grands were shipped to it
look at technology they call it downloading pssh
i call it downsizing somebody follow me follow me	
does a computer chip have an astrology does it
and when it fuck up could it give you an apology could it
should it say hello or should it say goodbye goodbye
try to understand how smart and how hood am i
it dont matter though

i wrote murdah so you could say its murder he wrote
you think im hell sent so you repent to the pope
so dont walk when the sign says not to
and dont talk when black thoughts about to
when i say maestro and bro starts to play it
if you got a rhyme in your mind then dont say it
save it for the weaker 
pack your portable speaker
and utilize the treads on your sneaker
and take your sorry crew back in forget about rappin
forget you ever saw me and forget this ever happened
cuz you might have nightmares of mcs being slain
and ill be to blame when you go insaneim from the land of them straight razor face beard niggas
with hammers on their waist yeah waste rare niggas
and i race scared niggas them snake head niggas

i dont care nigga you now listening to the sounds
of the money making jam trillionaires nigga
gentlemen of an extraordinary league
you never see me blowing on no ordinary weed
what im smoking aint a product of no ordinary seed
your boy is heavy treed im feeling merry
as a tyler perry scene that monetary gang green
we tried to launder the cash and never came clean
so now im in the story with all the cats before me
and smoke purgatory for doing the same thing
and them niggas aint change them niggas cant change
their moms shake their heads saying its such a dang shame
to the buck did another dang plan
my stage and my government aint the same name
im a rock star love it that my wallet chain hang
im a modern day saint; im a modern day king
my definition i can finally explain
cold smooth like that dud sean connery was playing
i just got to be the man im the father figure and
when i spit its something like a psychology exam
if you stand where i stood you could probably understand
how that mic feeling like a million dollars in my hand
its the silence of the lamb go and cop another gram
and twist with your zanny work your set work it down
whats your net working plan you better look alive
cuz them niggas outside looking desperate again nigga
and the blunts and liquor killing our lungs and liver
the asthmatic drug addict i function with it
i put a rapper in a hole where the dust will sit
for spitting played out patterns that once was hitting
i got news for you all let me show you how to ball

450 fahrenheit on the thermostat

so give him the game ring for bringing what them niggas cant bring
my hustle is long my muscle is strong
my man put the paper in the duffle im gone

just a pawn stepping right into the head of the storm
you been warned i will blow yall niggas and disintegrate
im a rebel renegade must stay paidthe son wont face the father

while youre waitin the times upchorus 
monday they predict the storm 
tuesday they predict the bang 
wednesday they cover the crash 
and i can see its all about cash 
and they got the nerve to hunt down my ass 
and treat me like a criminal

hater for the greater good 
im back from hollywood 
and i aint changed a lick

but what im doin is not a good look 
i never did it by the good book as a lifetime crook 
all the petty crime took a toll on me 
i look around at my homies thats gettin old on me 
but still somethin gotta hold on me 
maybe its fate
if its comin yo im willing to wait 
im not runnin i done ran through the muck
i done scrambled and such 
i done robbed an odd job and gambled enough 
till im put up in handcuffs 
and pissin in a cup 
if theres a god 
i dont know if he listenin or what 

chorus

yeah it is what it is 
and thats how it go 
get treated like a criminal

get greeted like a nigga 
niggas all you show

my city like a island where you cant find a boat 
have you wishin for a raft 
and prayin that hope flows 
some real ethnic cleansin is goin down with no soap
who lookin for a chair and some real strong rope 
just to end it all here 
screamin f**k the mayor 
he see the faces at the bottom of the well clear
they act like im somethin to fear 
trapped in urban warfare 
and pullin triggers at a college career 
cant ignore the call of the wild 
thats drawin em near 
try to make fast money last long some years 
try to laugh it off 
still couldnt lose the tears 
to the rules i will not adhere 
break the law yeah {echoes} 

chorus 

saigon 
who wanna challenge mine 
im sick of st valentine 
i did the violent crimes 
thats why i got this style of rhyme 
seek repentance to spittin them sentences 
to senseless experience is the difference 
you cant convince this 
in a crime sense niggas is infants 
im like a senior citizen 
still livin but gettin benefits 
put emphasis on hittin my nemesis in high percentages 
crooked ass cops is the reason for my belligerence 
and it gets deeper than that 
remember nights i used to sleep wit a gat 
with a package of crack under my sneaker strap 
ds sneak attack and raid me 
it took a week for that 
beat the rap but youre sayin look he think he the mack 
f**k yall 
niggas who thinkin they might try us 
watch us incite riots 
flip cars and light fires

plus cops rush to brutalize us 
americas polluted by lust

if i aint got love for you

like oh yeah i told her that her baby moving slower
cuz the world is on his shoulders then i woke up out that coma
and got right back at it with a little black matic
lay you down craft-matic then im gone black magic
to the hideout you dont want to gamble with the devil
especially when them chewy blueys got me on another level
cuz my teacher think im slow but my momma think im special
but even she know im coming back like an echo

[chorus dice raw talib kweli]

[dice raw]
for the statements im about to make i will not apologize
niggas talk a lot of shit really need to stop the lies

acting tough on tv but to me you seem a little timid
dont blame the nigga blame america its all business

acting like a monkey is the only way to sell tickets
shit i can dig it niggas gossip silly digits
white kids buy it its a riot when we talking about pimping
or sipping on old english brew or whatever they think we do
spraying double uzis cuz you know they think we live in zoos
the problem is with this everyone seems to be real confused
the niggas on the streets to the old people that watch the news
and watch bet and the crazy shit they see
they associate with you do the same shit to me
when you look at me you see just a nigga from the projects
but cant understand this niggas mind set but still

[chorus dice raw talib kweli]

[black thought]
yo a revolutions what its smelling like it aint going be televised
governments is hellified taking cake and selling pies

murder is comodified felon for the second time
never was i into chasing trouble i was followed by
facing trouble with no alibi had to swallow pride
vilified victimized penalized criticized
ran into some people thats surprised i was still alive
look into my daughters eyes wonder how can i provide
got to get from a to b but how can i afford to drive
messed around tried to get a job and wasnt qualified
had to see a pal of mine got to get the lightning rod
now im in the black impala looking for the dollar sign
palms get the itching man i got to get the calamine

lost all semblance of hope so now im left with

nervous conditions addictions in addition
to vixens that mixed in with the wrong crowd
my life is on a flight thats goin down
my mother had an abortion for the wrong child

well the time i felt love thats gone now
been replaced by purple rains and some storm clouds
misery love misery
so why make friends lets make some enemies

and now i got a habit that wasnt meant for me

one more reason to change identity

look im so twisted so so twisted
one life to live and im willing to risk it
terror that the world has never known existed
left so many clues now how could they miss it
sadistic ballistic find a word and pick it
long as it means the world is on my shit list
walking time bomb my mind is on tick-tick
countdowns on its too late to nix it
im so anxious so so anxious
the ones i hate barely know what my name is
have no clue that im armed and dangerous
willing to spill my blood to be famous
willing to spill my blood to make changes
look for a suicide note to explain this
heinous inking the ache from my anguish
sounds insane youre speaking my language

one for the pressing two for the cross
three for the blessing four for the loss
kid holding a weapon walk like a corpse
in the face of transgression military issue kalash
nikova or machete or a pitchfork
he killing cause he feel he got nothing to live for
in a war taking heads from men like charles taylor
and never seen the undisclosed foreign arms dealer
13-year-old killer he look 35
he changed his name to little no-man-survive
when he smoke that leaf shorty believe he can fly
he loot and terrorize and shoot between the eyes
who to blame its a shame the youth was demonized
wishing he could see rearrange the truth to see the lies
and he wouldnt have to raise his barrel to target you
his heart cant give you the years of scar tissue[mercedes martinez]
when i think about perfect times
i think about yesterday
you can asked me about the future
i dont know what to say
tomorrows storys unknown
so listen
its almost anyones guess
unwritten

it was a cold night
not cold like the winter
just cold like a energy was in the air
i generally dont like

the driver had to dip so he left me in the whip
turned around and said you know youre on your own right

[pause]

im the zone like
theres pictures on the wall of my own life
just like a drive-in
only its live and this a montage of the places i been
my sixth sense taste the problem
the sus-pense had my heart racin throbbin
just like a young punk with a tape revolver
pointed at the driver of a car faced to rob him
the cigarettes chased the vodka
the nigga just chased the dream but wont taste the monster
the son wont face the father
the gun wont erase the drama
while youre waitin the times up

what you stand for kid
we in the city where they definitely lost it
you open your eyelids and get capped in the ribs
your funeral they have your 12th grade portrait
pretty corpse in casket bell-shaped orchids
said he 19 and left a self-made fortune
and left trey orphans
now he in a box with the same chain and watch
that never came off him
its a shame what it cost him
where he come from it aint nuthin
its a everyday thing thats a problem
its chambers revolving
bustin like russian roulette
with a full set then change what the odds is
flames in the mosque and
people held hostage
everyday i struggle try to get up out the mosh-pit
homicide for profit tell me how we not sick
this shit is out of control they cant stop it

fightin a war they aint pay me enough to join
behind a phrase they was crazy enough to coin

the pursuit of happiness life liberty and all type of necessities they
not givin me
i put my body in jeopardy cause im committed even though they try to
stifle your man creativity
they got plans and hopes of gettin rid of me

and use mics to reach new heights the blue lights
follow i guess its the sin of chicago
the make em wanna mess with my tomorrow
in these borrowed days
its the rhyme and the mind that pays
the world is a show you define your stage

ive seen the future listen believe the superstition
i keep spittin til its a truce or crucifixion
home in the pressure zone weakness is never shown
let alone im a man made of mere flesh and bone
i cant help that my heart beat as a metronome

r-rated show 

[black thought] 
yo she said she was a magazine editor named jenning 
backstage in high heels and painted on jeans 
probably had the most devious eyes id ever seen 
told me she was twenty-two she was only seventeen 
she had sumthin to hide she snuck in from outside 
and got everybody gassed like the car i drive 
with all that grown lady ass and my for rap vibe 
she said she came to see them roots boy fallout live 
but listen 

[chorus] 

verse 2 [black thought] 
you see the girls look good but they brains not ready 
i talk to a woman he mind more steady 
probably something in the way they designed just more steady 
i just let you recite cause the line so heavy 
but i shoulda known better cause now i feel like americas underbelly 
r kelly got a smart better less internet predators chat-room irregulars 
this not my twist 
you trying to send me to the therapist 

[chorus] 

verse 3 [black thought] 
now she told me cheddar cheese grits 
two tomato fried fish 
cause she heard its my dish 
tryna be my sidekick 
all the people all around thinking she was my chick 
saying damn the girl thick 
but she aint no twenty-six 
looking at me like am up to sumthin on the funny tip 
like i ever been the one to honey jib 
its your birthday so let me know the gift you wanna get 
in fact blow out the candles on the cake and make a wish for me 

hook [patrick strump] 
they cant really seem to look away 
so they tried asking her to stay 
fake id you wont get turned away

so many better ways of having fun 
right now i can only think of one 
you look lovely tonight

trapped no shield no sword
the unbeaten path got my soul so sore
allured by the lust something money cant cure
the devil want me as is but god he want more
eyes closed eyes open great another day here we go
like a nigga woke up late in the truman show
living life without a care mean pokerface
but im forced to play solitaire till i get up out of here
move like a wanted man with a bounty on his head
work alone sleep alone eat alone daily bread
counting till my fingers red how you gon judge a man
walking in the shoes of a man with a broken leg
flame on the trail headed for the powder keg
last place in the race i aint never led
like i aint never bled time to get up out of bed
serving in the army of one its on again

[chorus 2x dice raw]
walk alone i walk alone you know i walk it alone
i always been on my own ever since the day i born
so i dont mind walking alone

[porn]
im in a chess match im in a death trap
im tryna find out where the eggs in the nest at
im one blood when the sky turns jet black
no love in the world can correct that
im in a slow lane im on my cobain
im in the new spot tryna run a old game
i got a new chick put out my old flame
no peace no sleep no love for a young beast
you can put me in a cage
you can put me in the jungle where the lion get blazed
there aint no hell like the hell i raise
id die in the bed i made fore i lay with a love i loathe
im a snake in the garden of bones
im a loner in a world of clones
im the piece that dont belong see i roam
where the the reaper roam till they put my name on a stone

[chorus 2x]

[black thought]
the longest walk ill probably ever be on
the road to perdition guess im finna get my plea on
i pray these wings strong enough to carry me on
i promise every second felt as if it took an eon
walking like the lost boys of sierra leone
the trail of tears what they got me like a cherokee on
between the ears something i require therapy on
for the working the bone like my name robert dion
i go above and beyond the duty called truly yall
even though they kind of blew me off like a booty call
asked me if im just another muli or a movie star
forced to face the +music+ like a graduate of juilliard
walk alone talk alone get my charlie parker on
make my make alone shed light upon the dark alone
get my sparkle on its a mission im embarking on
a kamikaze in the danger zone far from home

[chorus 2x]dear god i’m trying hard to reach you
dear god i see your face in all i do
sometimes it’s so hard to believe it…
but god i know you have your reasons
uh huh

[verse 1]

they said he’s busy hold the line please
call me crazy i thought maybe he could mind read
who does the blind lead
show me a sign please
if everything is made in china are we chinese

and why do haters separate us like we siamese
technology turning the planet into zombies
everybody all in everybody’s dirty laundry
acid rain earthquakes hurricane tsunamis

terrorist crime sprees assaults and robberies
cops yellin’ stop freeze
shoot him before he try to leave
air quality so foul i gotta try to breath
endangered species
and we runnin’ out of trees

if i could hold the world in the palm of these
hands i would probably do away with these anomalies
everybody checkin’ for the new award nominee
wars and atrocities
look at all the poverty

ignoring the prophecies
more beef than broccoli
corporate monopoly
weak world economy
stock market topplin’
mad marijuana oxycotton and klonopin
everybody out of it

[hook]

well i’ve been thinkin’ about
and i’ve been breakin’ it down
without an answer

i know i’m thinking out loud
but if you’re lost and around
why do we suffer
why do we suffer
uh huh

[verse 2]

yeah… it’s still me one of your biggest fans
i get off work
right back to work again
i probably need to go ahead and have my head exam
look at how they got me on the def jam payment plan

well i’m in the world of entertainment and
trying to keep a singing man sane for the paying fans
if i don’t make it through the night slight change of plans
harp strings angel wings and praying hands

lord forgive me for my shortcomings
for going on tour and ignoring the court summons
all i’m trying to do is live life to the fullest
they sent my daddy to you in a barrage of bullets

why is the world ugly when you made it in your image
and why is livin’ life such a fight to the finish
for this high percentage
when the sky’s the limit
a second is a minute every hour’s infinite

[outro]

dear god i’m trying hard to reach you
dear god i see your face in all i do
sometimes it’s so hard to believe it[dice raw]

yo so what you searching for from birth
born hurting and yearning for certain somethings
lurking and murk them got them turning this
bed into a coffin burning over passions in this passion
or more or less over what the past done passed us
cause see the past tense it never really passes
phases that trap us and cage us like classes
fogging my glasses lost in a mass mess
task-less dilemma to match somebodys status
and im average as fuck no car cats gassing me up
passing bucks like a casual blunt
granted hustling habits on the stumble the mansion
while bums pass asking for a buck for some bagged bricks
bad shit going down on the daily
while bad chicks pass in a mercedez damn
they see hes the bastard for chasing them
maybe its the patterns that make me that made me crazy

life is fiction competition and contradiction
petty perceptions window dressing for misdirection
love is a lotto i know i know you know what i know
hope is so hollow thats why winos follow the bottle
and people pressure make death a hidden treasure
a girly pleasure lonely language inside a letter
its now or never move it move it love it or lose it
fore its recruited then included inside the stupid
its things of nature paid a player and say your prayers
naysayers the haters the major players the beggars
you bout it bout it dont allow it to pow without it
then those who doubt it do or die to death are cowards
the world is yours and the world we cant afford
so ignore the law; start a fire then start a war
if youre sick and tired of your access denied
free will died long before glydes and ipod

yo its too much strain phenomenal gain
im going through things; headaches abdominal pain
tryna numb it with that kettle like im from the ukraine
check the blue flame lighter running out of butane
whats up with my destructive urge thats unproductive
choices im stuck with now starting to fuck with
contaminating family and close friends
telling me to stop burning the candle at both ends
aint like im on a coke binge hanging in dope dens
or life is just a pool of patron im soaked in
the darker the covenant-slash-trainwreck for you to rubberneck
you aint felt the true pain yet so you be loving that
hit me up at blackgov like the government
banana republican alien intelligence
kill switch real pissed thinking of some ill shit
the stone the builder refused he need to build with
got immunized for both flus im still sick
via satellite radio the realness

and i want to change too
its one thing i know
it aint cool being no fool
i feel different today
i dont know what else to say
but imma get my shit together
its now or never

[black thought]
im sick sick of waiting in vain tired of playing the game
thinking of making a change finally breaking the chains
every phase every happening craze
when its said and done my head is right back in a haze
im ready for the next chapter and page to start acting my age
and part ways with black thought from back in the days
im stargazing from the back of the stage
questioning if  is worthy of praise
whats the phrase bygones is bygones
niggas who used to be the underdog is icons
people say the light shines once in a lifetime
is this meant like com a crisis a little bit like mine
im thinking not now but right now
i need some kinda sign that the future is bright now
i fuck around do the right thing like spike now
the quick and the dead which one is my lookalike now
im moving ahead

[phonte]
yo opportunities lost because i blew them
on the sunniest days of my life i cried through them
moms was out the picture and pops i barely knew him
and i would pray to god but im tired of lying to him
tired of trying to run from the things inside of us
got a lot of fam and a lot of admirers
who tell me that i should aspire to be changed
but when i think of changing its like even try this shit
my mind hazy and my thoughts they get distorted
i know my good and bad deeds both get recorded
you do right so your soul can last
but my role was cast before i even auditioned for it
so i dont really see an end to my vice
its just false reformation no end of my strife
feel the evil overpowering you can go ahead throw the towel in
cause nigga thats the end of the fight
when you can only see the tunnel at the end of the light
lights out party over thats the end of your life
and im out

[dice raw]
when i look into the mirror and see my own image
i feel like theres something else far off in the distance
something i wanna see but something thats resistant
and everyday the heartin is growing more persistent
i never noticed it before but now i cant miss it
and the constant pounding is driving me ballistic
i ran from it for years but its still next to me
and its growing stronger taking even less of me
i cant fight it now i know its just destiny
and i just wonder whats gonna happen when it catches me
will it leave me face down and a 
or will it just start bringing out the best in me
but is the best in me really just the worst in me
and if so yesterday could be my anniversary
and sinners court is it important to have church with me
im trying to get rid of these ghosts thats cursing me
i feeling change is an absolute certainty
cause whats coming on is a state of emergencychorus 1 dice raw]

pray for me if it aint too much bother 
whatever dont break me a-make me stronger 
i feel like i cant take too much longer
its too much lyin and too much fightin 
im all cried out cause i grew up cryin 
they all got a sales pitch i aint buyin 
they tryin to convince me that i aint tryin

and tired and sick of being sick and tired
of livin in the hood where the shots are fired 
we dyin to live so to live we dyin

when i wake up i look into the mirror
i can see a clearer vision
i should start living today
cause today is gonna be the day is gonna be the day
cause today is gonna be the day is gonna be the day

[blu]
yeah it’s like everyday i wake up i stare into space and don’t say much
peer in the mirror feeling dead from the face up
coffee pots cigarettes morning js baileys
slowing down my day before it picks up the pace
beats playing since the night before thinking bout writing songs
feeling exhausted from times we toured constant
and plus the toxics i sip got me tall
still tipsy staring at the city from the spot we call los angeles
every day is like a blank canvas
carving my initials in the planet like i brand it
hand picked to live this life we take for granted
like a child with an upright bass we can’t stand it
smiling through the trouble we face tryna manage
my way without pumping my brakes and staying stagnant
cause i can sit on my ass or just imagine
the madness i did on my path and paint the canvas

[chorus patty cash]
when i wake up i look into the mirror
i can see a clearer vision
i should start living today
cause today is gonna be the day is gonna be the day
cause today is gonna be the day is gonna be the day

[black thought]
before i rise and shine like a neon sign
i need the girl of my dreams to give me einstein
and burn the marijuan’ like buju banton
is my only bonafide break from these confines
i need a change of scenery like a montage
these kids bringing me the noise like the bomb squad
and everybody coming at me from the blindside
i’m tired it’s hard to open up my eyes wide
i listen to some theme music on the ipod
and walk around the crib doing little odd jobs
checking my breath take a view from this high rise
feeling like i’m checking out a game from the sideline
i got to try different things in these trying times
twenty-ten is different than it was in nine-five
it’s come alive time i picked a fine time
for getting open off life like a fine wine

[chorus patty cash]
when i wake up i look into the mirror
i can see a clearer vision
i should start living today
cause today is gonna be the day is gonna be the day
cause today is gonna be the day is gonna be the day

[phonte]
uh yeah sunday morning plan my day out
whole new blueprint brand new layout
deep down still don’t know if it’ll play out
but the first time feel like i done found a way out
skin getting clearer and it feel like i lost weight
stop and say a prayer for the times i lost faith
troubles of the world had me in a cross-face
chicken-wing sickening liver so off-base
but now it’s like i’m in the last lap of the car chase
and i finally understand my right to choose
my preacher man told me it could always be worse
even a three-legged dog still got three good legs to lose
so you can stop and refresh the rules
breathe in breathe out let it heal all your exit wounds
something inside said that’s the move
and maybe today i’ll restart fresh and new

[chorus patty cash]
when i wake up i look into the mirror
i can see a clearer vision
i should start living today
cause today is gonna be the day is gonna be the day
cause today is gonna be the day is gonna be the dayhit it

for this love i go above and beyond the limit
i told yall im above and beyond the gimmick

so my presents a gift
its evident im heaven sent
with thomas edison elements
reverence for what i represent
to show my benevolence
this is dilly 
im rapping for the art of the city
came from southwest atlanta 
gave my heart to the city
when slugs fly thugs cry
cause every part of it is gritty
niggas shootin up the club
like they party with diddy
you get the diggy
i put my incandescence to fluorescence
and in essence 
i can burn wit joules of energy per second
i put em on the lessons 
while im smokin all the blessings
the switch hitter like pete rose
right in possession

we should shine a light on

take it to the very top
im gonna do a snare roll[chorus john legend]
i keep it doin it again
oh im doin it again
yes im doin it again
i said it would end

[black thought]
uh remix rising up out of the flames like a phoenix
straining to carry the weight of my brain like a genius
knowing im sowing seeds lets see whose thumb is the greenest
if i said i mean it i did it because i need it
eat sleep it or bleed it write it down and then read it
asphalt to the cement your trash talk delete it
i blast off then lay em out like a tempur-pedic
its black thought for certain ima win eventually
this unsung underrated under-appreciated
the one them underachievers had underestimated
finally graduated im one of the most hated
something thats so sacred nobody gon take it
face it i keep doin it well
doin it sans assistance just do it yourself
doin it below the radar we doin it stealth
doin it again for illadelph yo who else
we gon do it again

[chorus]

[black thought]
yeah ayo im on a job see my eyes focused where the prize be
even though they tried to rob me and sabotage the spot
just like pac when they got him in the lobby
try to tax youll find me like ronald isley
i is a changed man no ifs ands or probablies
niggas used to know me they dont even recognise me
yep the p-5-d is who the repertoire be
doin it again just like poitier and cosby
im like martin luther king you like rodney
the difference is i give it everything inside me
dear diary the fans still swear by me
even though im late night now like heres johnny
swimming with them great whites now thats where to find me
funny how it break right down but never mind me
forever grimy i guess its just philly shining
rock roller bi-polar like phyllis hyman

[chorus][john legend]
ohhhh the fire the fire
ohhhh the fire the fire

[chorus john legend]
theres something in your heart
and its in your eyes
its the fire inside you
let it burn
you dont say good luck
you say dont give up
its the fire inside you
let it burn

[black thought]
yeah and if im ever at the crossroads
and start feeling mixed signals like morse code
my soul start to grow colder than the north pole
i try to focus on the hole of where the torch goes
in the tradition of these legendary sports pros
as far as i can see ive made it to the threshold
lord knows ive waited for this a lifetime
and im an icon when i let my light shine
shine bright as an example of a champion
taking the advantage never copping out or cancelling
burn like a chariot learn how to carry it
maverick always above and beyond average
fuel to the flame that i train with and travel with
something in my eyes say im so close to having the prize
i realise im supposed to reach for the skies
never let somebody try to tell you otherwise

[chorus]

[black thought]
one love one game one desire
one flame one bonfire let it burn higher
i never show signs of fatigue or turn tired
cause im the definition of tragedy turned triumph
its david and goliath i made it to the eye of
the storm feeling torn like they fed me to the lions
before my time start to wind down like the mayans
i show em how i got the grind down like a science
it sounds like a riot on hush its so quiet
the only thing i hear is my heart im inspired
by the challenge that i find myself standing eye to eye with
then move like a wise warrior and not a coward
you cant escape the history that you was meant to make
thats why the highest victory is what im meant to take
you came to celebrate i came to sever great
i hate losing i refuse to make the same mistake

[john legend]
ohhhh the fire the fire
ohhhh the fire the fire

[chorus]

[john legend]
ohhhh the fire inside you
the fire inside you
the fire inside you
the fire inside you[scatting]

yo jam boy magic mr fantastic
masterful mind the list that ive crafted
fresh new trick to flip im dick dastard
half smooth criminal and half straight bastard
no mask when your flag get captured
first class take you to the rap hereafter
gone in a flash and yet he gets faster
sick when he hits the mike like mixmaster
this the battle of troy with no pastor
slicker than a can of oil with no castor
chill in the front of the flight outclass them
bring your favorite rapper to fight ill trash him
then ill leave in a timely fashion
uh emcees get the tiny rations
your girl hold me close as a tiny dancer
you got a death wish well its finally answered prick

[black thought]
yo jam boy magic mr sarcastic
rap catalogue consists of all classics
blackness tell your bitch to fall backwards
fuck a hood pass my shits for all-access
killing tracks like this we call practice
any bullshit yall twist we call backwards
jam boy sharp as a tack we all cactus
waiting on a big payback with no taxes
so if you follow the game you might catch this
act like an activist; you know active
nigga like me just has to spit acid
sucker like you just has to get blasted
ashes to ashes frasier to cassius
no homo yall some pains in the asses
get turned to toast like raising your glasses
when im on stage girls swing from the rafters
often nasty like monster mashing
yall know the voice is tight hoarse and raspy
cant place the face kind of hard to catch me
kings that pull strings like dorothy ashby
jawns keep telling me im great like gatsby
caught like a felony you cant slide past me
im low-key kind of anti-flashy
then im og up in a black tie classy
sun tzu to sun rai gargemel mumm-ra
son of a shooter letting slugs from a gun fly
should call a mumbai with the bumbaclot
its black thought my sounds hard to come by
last spotted on a yacht getting dumb high
banging yacht rock with my squad from 215
straight calling niggas out like the umpire
any chump tryna front word em up

[peedi peedi]
jam boy magic mr get-busy you get busy too
then get with me too well get busy dig me
smooth remy tool skinny but hold plenty
22 long contact new bentley
no miles yet curve backs and cruise and he
bring it back when you through with it roger that
grip tenny french mammies in vic panties
lips candy dick hard as a fifth of brandy
hop in it for five minutes then im finished
cause pussy is pleasure but im attending my business
retractable roof magical coupe disappearing
and reappearing german engineering this mclaren
hot jacuzzis watching movies glock and uzis
shots of louis busting cuties popping jeweries
ooh ooh ultramag mc in a m3
whole body tatted straight up out a mp[black thought]
let me tell you what priceless is some advice to give
a sacrifice is what i made for the wife and kids
they say lifes a bitch but its one life to live
i want my baby where that cake and the icing is
out of them crisis-es off of them vices-es
they see what we do and grow up in all likenesses
really i dont wanna see em having to fight for this
story of the family biz ima rewrite the script
daughter of a hip-hopper hustla like her grandpapa
her destiny done been determined so you cant stop her
from being independent earning paper and proper
more like a lawyer or a doctor not a man watcher
thats where your man got ya its a big world out yeah
im tryna make a black diamond or a pearl out yeah
and hit the people to the way the world twirl out yeah
and when i thank heaven for my little girl

[chorus sts]
please let her be a hustla baby be a hustla
hope my baby girl grows up to be a hustla

if not then youre only a customer
please let him be a hustla baby be a hustla
hope my baby boy grows up to be a hustla
let him be a hustla baby be a hustla
if not then youre only a customer

[sts]
sugar slim im slicker than a squid nigga no kids
no baby momma sugar freed from the drama
sugar be where he wanna no sweat/suite like a sonnet
no judge your honor cant tell me how to raise mine
figure that in due time if and when i do find
true love {} maybe you can blue-line
ooh im caught up in the moment for the meantime
g im all about the green like tree pines
see im tryna get the scratch like a feline
hoping that my seed dont know the struggle like me im
hustling to make a buck make a buck and fuck it up
fuck it up and suck it up then go and make another buck
get the money get the money thats what i know
im hoping that my seeds know a little more than i know
i know i know but baby this what i know
if we ever settle down well baby this what i hope

like when autumn leaves fall
down from the trees
there goes my honey bee
i’ve lost a lot of sleep to dreams
and i do not miss them yet
i wouldn’t wish them on than worst of enemies
let them burn go from here
like when autumn leaves

[verse 1 black thought]
to catch a thief who stole the soul i prayed to keep
insomniac bad dreams got me losing sleep
i’m dead tired my mind playing tricks deceit
a face in the glass unable to admit defeat
all that i am all that i was is history
the past unraveled adding insult to this injury
i’m fighting the battle for the soul of the century
destiny is everything that i pretend to be
look and what i did came back to me eventually
the music played on and told me i was meant to be awake
it’s unresolved like everything i had at stake
illegal activity controls my black symphony
orchestrated like it happened incidentally
oh there i go from a man to memory
damn i wonder if my fam will remember me

[chorus aaron livingston]
i’ve lost a lot of sleep to dreams
and i do not miss them yet
i wouldn’t wish them on than worst of enemies
let them burn go from here
like when autumn leaves[verse 1 big krit]
i did it all for the money lord its what it seems
well in the world of night terrors its hard to dream
holln cash rules everything lets call it cream
cause when it rises to the top you get the finer things
oceanfronts rollin blunts with model chicks
and sayin grace over lobster and steak
like please forgive us for ridin benzes with camera plates
too busy lookin backwards for jackers to pump my brakes
for help sign to symbolize the lives that hunger takes
addicted to the green if i dont ball ill get the shakes
id give it all for peace of mind for heavens sake
my hearts so heavy that the ropes that hold my casket break
cause everything that wasnt for me i had to chase
i had to chase

[chorus dice raw]
they told me that the ends
wont justify the means
they told me at the end
dont justify the dreams
that ive had since a child
maybe ill throw in the towel
make my make my
make my make my
hardship from the world

[verse 2 black thought]
trying to control the fits of panic
unwritten and unraveled its the dead mans pedantic
whatever see its really just a matter of semantics
when everybodys fresh out of collateral to damage
and my splayin got me praying like a mantis
i begin to vanish feel the pull of the blank canvas
im contemplatin that special dedication
to whoever it concern my letter of resignation
fadin back to black my dark coronation
the heat of the day the long robe of muerte
that souls in the atmosphere like airplay
if theres a heaven i cant find a stairway

[chorus dice raw]
they told me that the ends
wont justify the means
they told me at the end

that ive had since a child
maybe ill throw in the towel

yo the spirit in the sky scream homicide
but it was time to ride on some niggas funny talking
if too much money talking we make em economize
real rap no tale spinning such is the life of a
kamikaze pilot we wyling out of control
until we all make the funny papers like comic-con
feared in all streets so if you ever see me out in y’all streets
find another one to occupy
i never hope for the best i wish a nigga would
turn around and walk away i wish a nigga could
listen to my instincts and say fuck the rest
but once you’ve had the best better ain’t as good
weak-heartedness cannot be involved
stick to the script nigga fuck your improv
like the samurai the street’s hammurabi code
play your part shut the fuck up and do as i was told

[chorus]
i was always late for the bus
just once can i be on time
then i start to think what’s the rush
who wants to be on time
feeling unlucky and if i ever got lucky it was one time
in this crazy world

[verse 2 black thought]
not a thing i fear besides fear itself
this is clearly a lesson learned for someone else
reach for the crown of thorns upon the shelf
cross around my neck i’ve been taught by stealth
capture this moment in time it’s a smash and grab
and where my party people y’all finna have a blast
you say goodbye i say hello first and last
hello hello now all of y’all elevate your glass
to an example of what time will do to you
when those nameless things just keep on eluding you
when shit is new to you and lies is true to you
words of suspects usual coming though to you
man i guess if i was ever lucky it was one time
then i went missing looking for the sublime
a nigga stayed low left the ladder unclimbed
time after time verse blank the line unrhymed

[chorus]
you ever wonder what’s the big fuss
for everyone be on time
what’s the big deal why do they feel
the need to have us marching on line
feeling unlucky and if i’d ever got lucky it was one time
in this crazy world

[verse 3 dice raw]
i wonder when you die do you hear harps and bagpipes
if you born on the other side of the crack pipe
niggas learn math just to understand the crack price
then drive in head first like the jack knife
cause out here yo you niggas can’t belly flop
if you wanna make the noise inside your belly stop
one time means being on the front line
being on the front line means ducking one time
the pendulum swinging my way couldn’t be more blind
niggas talk to the cops not even one time
cause we all going down just like the sub prime
or a cheap ass half gallon of ballantine
but hopping over gates to escape is sublime
then through the alley way and down to the sub line
tales from the streets a life of high crime
to make it to the bottom such a high climb

[chorus]
i was always late for the bus
just once can i be on time
then i start to think what’s the rush
who wants to be on time
feeling unlucky and if i ever got lucky it was one time

i’m in the double g three-piece tux
screaming dressed to kill hope somebody call my bluff
it’s a full house sipping on a royal flush
two queens is on my cuffs good times is in the cards
living on borrowed time i’m paying the extra charge
to feel like something small is worth a hundred large
swag is on retard charm is on massage
wit is on guard i challenge you to a duel
who needs a chain when every thoughts a jewel
god bless the weirdo when everyone’s a fool
fuck a genie and three wishes
i just want a bottle a place to write my novel
i am heroin to those that hear a rhyme
and think how do you find this upper echelon
this time let’s toast to better days
a beautiful mind and a flow that never age

yo i’m never sleeping like i’m on methamphetamines
move like my enemy ten steps ahead of me
say my reputation precedes me like a pedigree
gentlemanly gangsta steez beyond the seventies
holdin fast money without running out of patience
move in silence without running up in places
cake by the layers rich but never famous
hustle anonymous still remain nameless
in hindsight gold come in bars like a klondike
the minute before the storm hit is what i’m calm like
suited and booted for a shooting like it’s prom night
it’s suicide right pursuers tried like
to no avail and a hero’s what they died like
i’ve got em waiting on the news like i’m cronkite
not in the limelight or needed for the crime right
no boasts just bodied chalked close to the line tight

come get your kool on
stars are made to shine
come get your kool on

truck north
yeah outside where the killers and the dealers swarm
and inside they dressed up like it’s a telethon
black tie affair but they holding heavy arms
straight cash with a stash in the cummerbund
more bacardi and the bouncers of the party hum
riots erupting around and still we party on
made the quantum leap to a king from a pawn
but it was destined the conclusion was foregone
serenade of the former slave promenade
cause them long days in the sun have now become shade
so we doing high speeds in a narrow lane
say cheese free falling from the aeroplane
another feather in the cap for all the years
that we spent in luxurys lap without looking back
cause memories could sting like hornet
damn it felt good to see people up on it

come get your kool on
stars are made to shine
come get your kool on
stars are made to shine
come get your kool on
stars are made to shine
come get your kool on
stars are made to shine
stars are made to shine[verse 1 black thought]
yo we obviously need to tone it down a bit
running round town spending time like it’s counterfeit
everybody catching hay fever like sinuses
step in my arena let me show y’all who the highness is
you might say i could be doing something positive
humbled head down low and broke like promises
soaking and broken in a joke like comics is
not enough paper to be paying folks compliments
but when that paper got low so did my tolerance
and it ain’t no truth in a dare without the consequence
listen if it not for these hood inventions
id just be another kid from the block with no intentions
on the dock of that bay serving a life sentence
even if i’m going to hell i’m gonna make an entrance
yeah let em know i’m getting cheese like omelets is
but i’m the toast of the town like thomas is

[chorus bilal]
we’re all on a journey
down the hall of memories
don’t worry bout what you ain’t got
leave with a little bit of dignity
never loved what i had
always felt like i deserved more
but when i make it to the other side
make it to the other side
that’s when we’ll settle up the score

[verse 2 black thought]
yo we did this in remembrance of
faces from the past we no longer have an image of
carrying cold-blooded hearts that never been for love
brothers keep going for theirs but never get enough
world travelers that seen it all and did enough
only to return to learn the world wasn’t big enough
damn how long has it been i guess the jig is up
now all i know is i’m about to wake this nigga up
yeah that hindsight 20/20 now niggas dead on the money
trying to take something from me
it’s a wrap like mummy undone i am becoming
and when he’s tired of running through the layers of the onion
he’ll probably shed a tear cause they’ll be no more fast times
just his weak mind scrolled out like a bad sign
he never had enough and got confused when they asked why
life is only a moment in time and it passed by

[chorus bilal]
we’re all on a journey
down the hall of memories
don’t worry bout what you ain’t got
leave with a little bit of dignity
never loved what i had
always felt like i deserved more
but when i make it to the other side
make it to the other side
that’s when we’ll settle up the score

[verse 3 greg porn]
i’m sitting on top of the world ready to jump off
thinking of various ways to break a gun law
thinking that enough is enough but still i want more
thinking of how i’m playing with fire that burned my young boy
by any means necessary don’t give a damn
so every night i’m on a flight that never lands
be an asshole when the shit hits the fan
or bet your life on a bluff and a bad hand
can’t win can’t lose
get ‘em gassed leave em leaking fuel
either way the market moves
cash rules kings queens prince and princess
every night i’m crossing a line that ain’t the finish
every thought is dark as a glass of fucking guinness
too far gone to come back to my senses
now i’m on the edge of my bed making love to my meds
every moments like a pistol to my head
when i’m getting mine

[chorus bilal]
we’re all on a journey
down the hall of memories
don’t worry bout what you ain’t got
leave with a little bit of dignity
never loved what i had
always felt like i deserved more
but when i make it to the other side
make it to the other side
that’s when we’ll settle up the score[chorus just blaze]
it’s about flesh and blood
it’s about a heartbeat that beats strong
it’s about a passion that’s unyielding
and i want you men to know today
it is your time
it is your hour
it is your moment
go take it

[verse 1 black thought]
yeah speaking of pieces of a man
staring at a future in the creases of my hand
it reads like a final letter i’m leaving for my fam
but it’s written in language they will never understand
a late repentant never deviating from a plan
i drive by headed for the valley of the damned
the wheels spin i’m looking for a sacrificial lamb
then roll tactics like a soldier out in the sudan listen
was this a matter of flesh and blood yes it was
does it matter who win and lose yes it does
it ain’t about the most blessed love
when you return to the essence
what is it back to the essence of
greatness i wasnt in the presence of
cause you was fake and never measured up
you just a nigga on his regular
but how far am i ahead of ya
it just as easily couldve been me instead of ya

[chorus just blaze]
we gon’ fight till we can’t fight no more
and when we cant fight no more
we gon’ lie down and bleed a while
we gon’ get up
and fight some more
want you say it with me
repeat it after me when i say it
we gon’ fight

[verse 2 greg porn]
fuck getting fucked immaculate conception
now what’s beef ain’t even a question
calico kisses cold blood and crime tape
flirt with death every night it’s a blind date
one night stand payback’s a bitch
shit have you skinny dipping in a pool of your piss
blood sweat and tears broken teeth and spit
put the barrel in your mouth blow the devil a kiss
put the knife in ya back cut down to the red meat
daddy should’ve let me be a stain on the bed sheets
i’m one shot short of a molotov cocktail
kick in the door like welcome to my world
i’m an evil genius when it comes to this dumb shit
half of the time imma keep it one hundred
don’t play chicken when i’m driving them crazy
get hit in the wing thigh breast or drumstick
we like[dice raw]
if you can‘t swizzim then ya bound to drizzown
passing out life jackets bout to go didown
get down with the captain or go down with the ship
before the dark abyss i’m gon’ hit you wit’ dis

and no one’s in the lighthouse
you’re face down in the ocean
and no one’s in the lighthouse
and it seems like you just screamed
it’s no one there to hear the sound
and it may feel like there’s no one there
that cares if you drown
face down in the ocean

[verse 1 dice raw]
smoking cheap weed sipping on cheap vodka
you pick your poison down davey jones’ locker
it’s rum we be wanting by the tons my consumption
take a look at my lungs and my liver it’s disgusting
take a look at the man in the mirror we start fussing
only one person gets hurt when throwing the punches
me and the man behind the glass just laughs
the waves come over my head and just crash
my hand start bleeding water starts receding
a feeling comes into my heart i start believing
that i actually might survive through the evening
survive on my own thoughts of suicide that’s competing
with thoughts of tryna stay alive which been weakened
by the feeling of putting on a smile while being beaten
the fear of drowning still diving in the deep end
the waters carried me so far you can’t reach ‘em
and it feels like there’s no one

[chorus dice raw]
no one’s in the lighthouse
you’re face down in the ocean

[verse 2 black thought]
after the love is lost
friendship dissolves and even blood is lost
where did it begin the way we did each other wrong
troubled water neither one of us could swim across
i stopped holding my breath now i am better off
there without a trace and you in my head and all
the halted motion of a rebel without a pause
what it do is done till you dead and gone
the grim reaper telling me to swim deeper
where the people go to lo and behold the soul keeper
i’m not even breaking out in a sweat or cold fever
but i’m never paying up on my debt or tolls either
i’ll leave the memories here i won’t need them
if i stop thinking and lie now that’s freedom
your body’s part of the maritime museum
face down in the past is where i’m being

[chorus dice raw]
and no one’s in the lighthouse
you’re face down in the ocean

i drew a 2 of hearts from a deck of cards
a stock trick from my empty repertoire
another hopeless story never read at all
i’m better off looking for the end where the credits are
it’s a pain living life against the grain
i’m looking back and y’all look the same
troy mark and little what’s his name
memory is rerunning it all
it’s the flight of my fall and it’s right on the wall

[chorus]
i remember
can you remember
how it was
i do
remember
do you
[x2]

[verse 2 black thought]
i used to ride the train to the same two stops
and look at the graffiti on the rooftops
like the same song playing on the jukebox
joint called faded polaroids in a shoebox
regardless to what the cadence is
it can’t be forgotten like old acquaintances
i realize how depressing of a place it is
and when i notice my reflection whose face it is

[chorus]
i remember
can you remember
how it was
i do
remember
do you
[x4]

[verse 3 black thought]
it’s only human to express the way you really feel
but that same humanity is my achilles’ heel
a leopard can’t change his spots and never will
so i’m forever ill now i can never chill
what’s keeping me from breaking out like benadryl
when my baptism of fire resulted in a kill
sometimes it’s as cut and dry as a business deal
you gotta cause the blood of a close friend to spill
but you remember still[chorus dice raw]

[verse 1 black thought]
yo i’m always early i never take off
cause i got a job rob peter to pay paul
now i realize it’s the winner that takes all
do what i gotta do because i can’t take loss
picture me living life as if i’m some animal
that consumes its own dreams like i’m a cannibal
i won’t accept failure unless it’s mechanical
but still the alcohol mixed with the botanical
i guess i be referred to the owners manual full of loaners
full of all the homeless throwaways and the stoners
soldiers of the streets with 8th grade diplomas
and the world awaiting their shoulders as a bonus
look let he without sin live without sin
until then i’ll be doing dirty jobs like swamp men
counting the faces of those that i might have been
it’s like living that life but i won’t live that life again

[chorus dice raw]
homicide or suicide

some think life is a living hell

lot of niggas go to prison how many come out malcolm x
i know im not shit cant even talk about the rest
famous last words you under arrest
will i get popped tonight its anybodys guess
i guess a nigga need to stay cunning
i guess when the cops comin need to start runnin
i wont make the same mistakes from my last run in
you either done doing crime now or you done in
i got a brother on the run and one in
wrote me a letter he said when you comin
shit man i thought the goals to stay out
back against the wall then shoot your way out
gettin moneys a style that never plays out
til you end up boxin your stash moneys paid out
the scales of justice aint equally weighed out
only two ways out digging tunnels or digging graves out

[chorus dice raw]
homicide or suicide

some think life is a living hell
some live life just living well
i live life tryna tip the scale
