bitchi close my eyes and seize it
i clench my fists and beat it
i light my torch and burn it
i am the beast i worship

and i know soon come my time
for in mine void a pale horse burns
but i fear not the time im taken
past the point of no return
wage war like no tomorrow
cause no hell there wont be one
for all who deny the struggle
the triumphant overcome

trips to where few have been
out of thin air upon high winds
rites begin when the sun descends
have felt what few will ever know
have seen the truth beneath the glow
of the ebb and flow where roots of all mysteries grow
i am below so far below
the bottom line
transmitting live transmissions rise
from the depths out of controlled by
suspended glance of an unblinking eyes
imminent gaze cast pon the path that winds
pon the path i find and claim as mine
to ride the waves of unrest
made to make me shine as a testament
to why the ways of the blind will never get
shit but shanked by my disrespect
dismiss this life worship death
cold blood night of serpents breath
exhaled like spells from the endlessness
in the bottomless wells of emptiness
channeled to invoke what we represent

secret order
elitist horde of
creeping fire
seizing power
riders of the lupus hour
eye on palm
time is gone
moonlight drawn
fly til dawn
sacrifice to rise beyond
deep inside the violent calm
of the coming storm
in blood sworn
to glorify and for life adorn
with all that dies to become unborn

i close my eyes and seize it
i clench my fists and beat it
i light my torch and burn it
i am the beast i worship
i am the beast i worship

in the time before time eyes bove which horns
curve like psychotropic scythes
and smell of torn flesh bled dry
by hell swarms of pestis flies
vomiting forth flames lit by
an older than ancient force
that slays this life with no remorse

the spiral storm
of flames inside
the torch i raise
the force i ride

feel my vessel go up in flames
flesh torch lit by thee unnamed
direct connection to the source
vestment of unnatural force
forever burning black torch
wisdom of the old and true
possessed by the chosen few
shining to reveal the ways
of a darkness that pervades
all that is and ever was
inferno of witches blood

worship is not on bended knee
nature knows not of mercy
to pray is to accept defeat
power pisses on the weak
bow and beheaded by the beast
beggar on a bitches leash
scum is desperate for relief
worship is the way i ride
witching currents through the eye
of storms that force the false to die
worship the flames with which i rise
into apocalyptic skies

harsh winds flay mine flesh to bone
in splintered skeleton i roam
wastelands with not to call my own
but the path i walk alone
the hunger burns within my gut
as my bones turn into dust

and i know soon come my time
for in mine void a pale horse burns
but i fear not the time im taken
past the point of no return
wage war like no tomorrow know well there wont we one
for all who deny the struggle
the triumphant overcome 

i close my eyes and seize it
i clench my fists and beat it
i light my torch and burn it
i am the beast i worship
i am the beast i worshipit goes it goes it goes it goes

what is it where is it how will it affect me
work that angle till its beveled curve of the blade doubled
edge made to bleed the struggle best believe the games a hustle
observer of the strange occurrences conjurer of the subtle
unseen but felt disturbances that burst a bitches bubble

how i bend the rhythm over and hit hit hit it on my knees
give give give it up i need it all the time
bleed it on the drop of a dime down to pound it till it shines
moonlit lake of blood red wine make no mistake i makes it mine
break shit down and make it grind to the groove used to align
the cascading shades of jaded blues with these rhymes
nuclear steeze creeps and winds through secrets behind and between every time i scream
shit is mine its all mine all the time shit is mine

cause all i really need is some cool shit to mob
like driving down the street to the beat of a blowjob

shit is mine its all mine all the time shit is mineride and arthur brown
into the flame into the fire
with no regard for a thing
fuck that im the lord of the game
i rule this empire
i am the god of hell fire

ride and mexican girl
lord of the game
born to reign above all that you claim to know beyond a doubt
cause no one has came even close to the train of thought we drop like neutron bombs from the tower
control this and bang this then watch it rise higher
than anything seen in your entire
life spent in chains sonic live wire
electrified rain from the lips of the driver
whippin the wheel flippin donuts to peel
out on the face of the base wheres my lighter
need it to kill one more and chill while i feel it so much my gut burns like the tires
movin this movement of real shit inspired
by all that has come before this and was done for the real ones packin real guns loaded with power
shower the slums with power from the war marching drums that have come to devour
the weakness that runs when we come fuckin cowards

when they tell you you must take it you think hell no
got a bad feeling and cant shake it hits so low
when they tell you you must take it you think hell no
got a bad feeling and cant shake it hits so low

lord of the game
born to reign above all that you claim to know beyond a doubt
cause no one has came even close to the train of thought
we drop like neutron bombs from the tower
which we maintain like soldiers of fame
and fortune denied as to to get by without the
bullshit coming at me from all sides
nowhere to run nowhere to hide
told me it was all good but they lied
dont wait to see whites of their eyes
death to everyone who does not recognize
wars never done think it is you die

where was i now like i said before
hear someone knockin at my front door
who could it be should i ignore
the knockin or see what could be in store
for me if i leave the safety of the shore
so many options so little time
to do what i want fore the end of the line
places its blade in the small of my spine
is it paranoia is it real
how long can a man enjoy what he doesnt feel
when they ask if you can make it and you dont wanna go

when they tell you you must take it you think hell no
got a bad feeling and cant shake it hits so low
when they tell you you must take it you think hell no
got a bad feeling and cant shake it hits so low
when they tell you you must take it you think hell no
got a bad feeling and cant shake it hits so low
when they tell you you must take it you think hell no
got a bad feeling and cant shake it hits so low

crow on the down low end
reppin orions belt
atlantis ancient vagina
getting dusty on the shelf
enter the pigs dont get it
no hands im shattering jaws
double nickles on the dime
fuck glam can lick my balls

culture shock future shock
fuck yourself choke yourself

whatchya gonna be when youre grown young blood
gonna be a mindless drone
wont ever have to think
no your headll be linked directly to your cell phone
the virus is alive i can see it in your eyes
the infection is full blown

career killer double decker packed with suicidal brides
four armed fury in a filthy dream about splitting your bitches thighs
enters through unknowing eyes
touch the key its in your mind
cant delete it and soon youll find
how bad you need it all the time

culture shock future shock
fuck yourself choke yourself

shiva slashin through your flat screen
is nowhere for you to hide
strangled by anaconda thumbs to the soundtrack of world genocide
my thoughts tie knots in silver spoons
vampire on the rise
punk a chump wit a cunt for brains platoon
in the zone and on the grind

dead matter disposer from the mountains without peaks
catch and release
time released horse capsule swallowed to wake the savage beast

culture shock future shock
fuck yourself choke yourself

gotta get them outta here now
infected act so weird howd you get it
youre pathetic
quarantine the virus

culture shock future shock
fuck yourself choke yourself<span style=padding1em><img alt=trebleclef class= data-image-key=trebleclefpng data-image-name=trebleclefpng height=68 src=http//vignette2wikianocookienet/lyricwiki/images/1/1e/trebleclefpng/revision/latest/scale-to-width/30cb=20090423154754 width=30/></span> instrumentalim coming through thought you knew fuck if you didnt fuck you
plutonium lore
what this is what this for
feel my fists push black holes
through your bitch ass decor
split it back like a whore
and make you shit your fucking drawers

scared to ride cowards fall
before my eyes sound of my balls
dragging like cannon loaded wagons
drug by demons down your halls

cant imagine whats fit to happen
when i get to flashing see the small
shrink to a fraction of what their lacking
and less than that in no time at all
cant believe they have the gaul
to try and act like they’re not trapped
between these walls 

bring it bring it bring it kill it

bring it bring that shit heated
sling it bring back that shit - kill it

sometimes feel like im close but never get there
never get there
does it mean im a ghost if im still here
wanna leave here
and if i am why cant i just float through the walls
through the walls
and if i can were they even ever there at all
not at all

too much time spent in the maze will drive you mad i feel so bad
been there so long i cant remember who i am or where i stand
but in the end i guess i just don’t give a damn
twist a gram and keep on sticking with the original plan
fuck it man

judge you no more than i wish to be judged
even on the low
but i do know what you do not speak of
don’t know but it shows
try to hide but i see who you are because
i just know
keep talking but you already said too much
there you go

how it is nows how it it always was
that’s on my blood
how it is nows how it it always was
that’s on my blood

bring it bring that shit heated
sling it bring back that shit - kill it

see my blood spill drip by chances
try to chill quit cause i cant just slip into a zagthoth trance
tongue hissing serpent chants
come again work it in yeah just like that

we paint our insides black
as the shadows hind our flesh
and make all that we lack
the part of life that we forget
all praise due to the fact
that weve forgotten how to sweat it
check it
bring it
kill it

on everything i own
swear would rather slit my throat and die on the run
than be the one who ends up hangin from that rope
tied to the thumb of the man who comes to empty your pockets when you choke
got to get that shit myself and get the fuck out of this game
before i end up getting stuck with no one but myself to blame
all the way insane

staring at the ceiling
in the dark
trying not to let the feeling
tear you apart
but the silence is buzzing
and it wont stop
tell yourself its almost over
but its notknown for it known for it

known for it been through it
done everything i can to it
road to it til i broke through it
never was attached to it
took all i had in a flash knew it was bout ta crash
so i mashed through hit
known for it
had ta do it
hacked into it

i pay the price ta roll wit it
waste your life and you wont get it
played out wit nowhere ta go bet it
makes you feel like a ho don’t it
don’t it known for it

let it eat shit and die
as i creep lit
off the deep hits wit a sick mind
on the secrets i rely pon ta freak this

you can tell me what you said - go ahead
but no sooner than you said it
you can bet it was left for dead
all you said in and out of my head in seconds

keep em guessin endlessly
never let em know where your headed
king of the unknown cloaked in mystery
how ta show em they don’t mean shit ta me

never meant a thing to me
effortlessly dead to me
check the sign no vacancy
extremely selective memory

known for it gotta stay deep in the zone
or it’ll take everything you own floor it
get it get it

i pay the price ta roll wit it
waste your life and you wont get it
played out wit nowhere ta go bet it
makes you feel like a ho don’t it
don’t it known for it

let it eat shit and die
as i creep lit
off the deep hits wit a sick mind
on the secrets i rely pon ta freak this

known for it since way back all about it
never been without it
how ta ride it inside out of da clouded
by the enemy surrounded
thoughts that make you feel lost don’t doubt it
you might just need it

already did that
cant never go back
yeah fuck that
gets the bozack

laid on the gas leaned back and blew it
twelve gauge blasted out abused it
left it for the next hit eject done wit that
you want it you can have it no questions asked
left that shit on the side of the road in a ditch don’t trip
if ya have one let a man so i could flip a bitch and kill it

head for the hills when it makes you feel
like you cant ever chill no more fuck it
every time i get it ta wind round my finger and recline
behave or be slayed cause i will be damned if mine ever decays

forever on attack gut check the blind

game recognize game is tight
bow down or get banged for life

cause i am known for itbeen working way too much need to get out and get fucked up
whats going on wheres it at

too far up in it to yawn til its finished come on

off all of their clothes and whip
it on me like my bodys made to fit tween their lips
you got the ones on their grill
or between their hips
but either way i must say
i really dont give a shit
long as its done well and they promise not to tell

my absence stains me sketch gets weird
i thrive on empty

cant predict me with them petty such a pity
my peak keeps rising they keep sinking
into lakes theyre crying i keep spitting
wish i could see them dying but my peaks too fucking misty
tilt your lump till back of your brains tween your weak slumped shoulder blades
still cant scope peak i pave into oneway street to space
grovel in gravel at my base while saddle control you seek
this world of cattle at my feet born to get put back to sleep
at my feet born to get put back to sleep

one day ill wave sun to ice
watch its kind get thrown like rice
my cackle stretch out like thunder
so fucking loud its vulgar

i pull my face out the dirt slow
these days i only wake up third of the way narco
held to deep rapid eye move hold
these days i recede rapid i reload
gun my chances closed road no road left to travel

i know what this calls for
wheres my scalpel operation cut
like im bored sew my inner war up like corn rows
my internal war blows like freezing fog in oslo
frozen i cant get soft baptized in hoarfrost
like carbon monoxide garage
freeze your blink with sandmans flush
i hate you so much
i hate your laws
i hate your need a cause
i hate your faux touch
i hate every last one of you
i ponder digesting razors just to be done with you
i love you so much

im triple the motherfucker
mondo fisted full of backwards
from banana town manor
my slang step like legless lizard
i fuck around fashion a rocket
shoot to mercury for the winter
extended vacation till i decompose on my splinters

i pull my face out the dirt slow
these days i only wake up third of the way narco
held to deep rapid eye move hold
these days i recede rapid i reload
gun my chances closed road no road left to travel

to centuries of damn
ive never been so yawn
cant believe im still standing
cant believe life take this long
i stagger off to find my lighter
i dont return until the day sag a* validates
mankinds destiny in a worm

by the way i dont pet bleachers
court side to nose bleeders
like i shoot shit with gimps
no response losem once
incoming second attempt
to be real i just shoot em up just shoot em up
them clueless strut nailed to crucifix lilith shoved up her cunt shoved up her cunt

fuck

i pull my face out the dirt slow
these days i only wake up third of the way narco
held to deep rapid eye move hold
these days i recede rapid i reload
gun my chances closed road no road left to travel

these days i only wake up third of the way narco
held to deep rapid eye move hold
