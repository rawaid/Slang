but i will remain where the top begins

cause i am not a word i am not a line
i am not a girl that can ever be defined
i am not fly i am levitation
i represent an entire generation

i hear the criticism loud and clear
that is how i know that the time is near
so we become alive in a time of fear
and i aint got no muthafucking time to spare

cry my eyes out for days upon days
such a heavy burden placed upon me
but when you go hard your nays become yays
yankee stadium with jays and kanyes

why is that you could only see the worst in me
i swear sometimes i feel like it nurtures me
but to keep it all real is kinda hurtin me
i could say im done with it but it lurks in me

so imma just tell myself that it works for me
take a real long drive in the mer-ce-des
and i might pop a couple of them per-co-cets
yeah thatll make me transform to hercules

[chorus]
here i am here i am so tell me cause i am
here i am here i am so tell me cause i am
here i am here i am so tell me cause i am

[verse 2]
i swear to god man everything in life is old
and the only thing that change is the price of gold
even in the afterlife imma fight your soul
cause the second time around ill be twice as grown

so do you take me to be who i am
to have and to hold till death do us part
cause if not its just best we both part
cause how am i supposed to finish what you start

you got me thinkin twice to just breathe
then you say i wont survive if i leave
but i got a couple of tricks up my sleeve
i no longer need your attention at ease

its a joke its a game
why am i still keeping score
im in pain im ashamed
im a woman hear me roar

its a joke its a game
why am i still keeping score
im in pain im ashamed

im in pain im ashamed
im a woman hear me roar

here i am here i am
so take me as i ammaybe you died cause everybody asked me where you at
i tried to channel you in hopes that i could stare you back
but its like every intersection we just missed each other
you got your fans waiting tell me you aint six feet under
and tell that you coming back and you just took a break
maybe i blamed you for everything – that was my mistake
in hindsight i loved your rawness and i loved your edge
cause it was you who talked me down from jumping off the ledge
your earrings bamboo
your long nails too
your bmw
every time you came through
you was the brave heart
you stole wayne heart
you never switched it up
you played the same part
but i needed to grow
and i needed to know
were there some things inside of me that i needed to show
so i just deaded you
left you in all black
but dear old nicki
please call back

you told me youd come when i needed you
and you said it so sweetly i believed you
but im standing here calling
i cant see you
but i am holding you holding you holding you to that

yo did i chase the glitz and glamour
money fame and power
cause if so that will forever go down my lamest hour
i shouldve kept you with me gettin at them nameless cowards
there was no match for you
couldnt defeat your prowess
i had to make them changes – i hope you understood
you see for every bad i did a ton of good
but you was underground and i was mainstream
i live the life now that we would daydream
my only wish is you come enjoy it with me
get on them conference calls
go meet them lawyers with me
the money came yeah
tripled and quadrupled it
but i still miss us when we was just on some stupid shit
and it still fucked the media
they ridiculed you
never believed in ya
they just deaded you
left you in all black
but dear old nicki
please call back

you told me youd come when i needed you
and you said it so sweetly i believed you
but im standing here calling
i cant see you
but i am holding you holding you holding you to that

and yes im holding you holding you holding you

take everything from inside of me
your silhouette in the doorway
but before you walk away

dont say goodbye look in my eyes
so that i always will remember
frozen in time always be mine
baby boy youll be young forever

ill be over here youll be over there
ima shed a tear but i really dont care
frozen in time always be mine
baby boy youll be young forever

i used to think that wed reunite
id be your wife in the real life
i thought that youd come back for me
and you would take me away

i never knew only as a teen
youd reappear only in my dream
your silhouette in the doorway
but before you walk away

dont say goodbye look in my eyes
so that i always will remember
frozen in time always be mine
baby boy youll be young forever

ill be over here youll be over there
ima shed a tear but i really dont care
frozen in time always be mine
baby boy youll be young forever

this is my last cry
is this the only way
this is my own prison
im frozen in time in time in time

dont say goodbye look in my eyes
so that i always will remember
frozen in time always be mine
baby boy youll be young forever

ill be over here youll be over there
wanna shed a tear but i really dont care
frozen in time always be mine
baby boy youll be young forever

youll always be mine frozen in time
young forever young foreveryou shoulda left the other day
you let me beg for you to stay
this is a sickening joke that you play with my emotions
and so i pray you burn in hell and you never find the ocean…

i hope your fire fire burns baby
i hope your fire fire burns baby
i hope you lay down in your sleep and you choke on every lie you told
and when you’re reaching out for me you’ll see you reap everything you sow

right now[charlamagne]
let’s talk about new york city
i actually get in arguments because people say nicki doesn’t rep new york
i say what do you mean she shouts it out all of the time

[nicki minaj]
y’all don’t want me to rep y’all
y’all don’t hear when i rep y’all cause y’all be dick-riding everybody else

do you feel you get the proper love from new york
hell fucking no
i never understood that because you ran the same circuits of all these other rappers
you came up on mixtapes like everyone else

i was selling my mixtape out of my muthafucking bmw out on jamaica muthafuckin’ avenue to amadue and hussaine and all them
fuck you niggas
you niggas don’t know the half of what i’ve been through

[charlemagne]
what do you say to people that say you’re trying to be something that you’re not like lady gaga or madonna and you’re doing things for shock value

well i don’t know
in a minute if i fucking sit down and piss they’re going to tell me i can’t do that cause another bitch did it

[sb]
stupid ass bitches
people compare her to everybody
nicki gets it so hard

[charlamagne]
i think when they don’t understand something they have to compare it to something to make themselves feel comfortable

[nicki minaj]
absolutely i always say that
for their minds to interpret it they have to draw a comparison and i always say even though it’s very common it’s just a more simple-minded approach as opposed to looking at every situation as if it’s the first time
it is what it is but even she gets compared to madonna and it’s a never-ending cycle but i rather you compare me to someone that is winning and that’s won then compare me to

[charlamagne]
someone that is washed

[nicki minaj]
it’s easy for a loser to be jealous of a winner

[charlemagne]
do you ever look back at some of your costumes and your wigs and say i did look like a damn fool

[nicki minaj]
yes i do

you know what i like about superstars
i like my superstars to be out there
be like prince with your ass out
i may see it and say damn she looks like a fool but you’re a superstar

that’s how i want to see my superstars
i don’t want to see my superstars regular
i keep saying this i went to school for theater
i took four years of my life and devoted it to theater

i did that because my passion was acting
when i started rapping i felt like i couldn’t really be myself
when i started winning i started feeling that i can be myself
i can do my accents i can do my voices i can do my faces i can do costumes

i can now bring me to who you know people see as nicki minaj
i can now really bring me into it
and i think that’s where the confusion lies is that people thought that when i first came out that that was me in my entirety
but that wasn’t that was a small facet of who i was

but who you see now is a more multi-faceted mixture of all the different personalities that i have in me
i mean and i think that if i was to not show that then i wouldn’t be doing justice to all the people who feel like i do
cause for every person who doesn’t understand it is there is a person who feels like me who feels like sometimes i just break out in an english accent you know like what’s wrong with that

[charlemagne]
do you think that pop nicki and mixtape nicki can exist in the same space

[nicki minaj]
they already are and they are both winning

if it’s one thing that i would love for little girls to embrace from nicki minaj is the fact that she is versatile
she knows how to kick it in the streets and she knows how to kick it in the corporate setting
right because you can’t do too much of either you really can’t

it’s unfortunate that at times hip hop culture will tell you to lean only to one side when that is detrimental to your future
it’s detrimental for your growth
it’s detrimental to your longevity

at a certain point as a woman; i’m not talking about as a man because we’ve seen the blueprint with jay
weve seen that you could come in the game and do 10 12 15 – still win and still be the king of hip hop
we have not seen that with a woman so show me the blueprint
that’s all i want you to do – show me the blueprint

i think you are creating it because queen latifah doesn’t exist in that space anymore
she went on to become an actress
queen latifah is someone who i tip my hat to because queen latifah looked at it and said okay wait hmm i mean i wanna be 40 years old rapping i — the hip hop fans may not want to hear me when i’m 40 years old rapping
so i’m going to move in a way so that every aspect of who i am can be seen
queen latifah does musicals movies voice-overs for cartoons — is she a sellout or is she winning

so these other bitches that only did rap and now they’re washed and they’re living in you know low income housing — is that winning
just so that a nigga in the street can give me a fucking dap
the same niggas that didn’t buy my album any fucking way that downloaded the shit
get the fuck out of here

[charlemagne]
any regrets

[nicki minaj]
i think my only regret would be not enjoying every single moment as i should have

on what she would like to do outside of rap her bigger purpose
i have to pray on that
i think that my purpose will eventually be related to some sort of movement for my younger fans really
i really am interested in learning how to build the education system to a point where we have more of a success rate in terms of black children that go from high school to college

i feel like college was not something that was engraved in my brain
i don’t feel like that ever happened
most of my closest girlfriends it was just like once they got out of high school they figured oh well we’re out of high school or i got my ged i’m good and i don’t want my fans to think like that

one day you’re going to look back and think wait a minute did i really lose my life clubbing and miss out on a moment where i could’ve been building myself as a woman and having something to offer my children
we got so many girls right now having children and don’t even know the first thing to say to a child

you’re having a child because i want to keep this dude or it just happened
i want to get us to the place where it doesnt just happen and that were smarter than that
we’re the ones in control again
why are we never in control

why are we stuck with a baby
why are we always stuck on the welfare line
why are we always stuck having to beg borrow and steal to provide for our children
why do we think it’s something wrong for waiting to have a baby

waiting until you’re 35 or 36 to have children; technology has changed – you can wait
have something to offer them
that’s something that’s dear to my heart
doing something that make children feel like i don’t have to rush to grow up
i can enjoy my childhood

[charlemagne]
how did you escape being more than just an ass
we said that the other day before i was just a rapping butt

[sb]
a butt with lyrics

[charlemagne]
how did you get out of that

[nicki minaj]
because i created a brand
people take for granted how hard it is so shout out to every woman and man that’s won
it’s very hard mentally this shit is draining
for you to be able to get up there and do music that people love and do interviews with a smile on your face and act like this shit ain’t getting to you it’s draining

it’s crazy
that’s why so many artists go on drugs or become alcoholics
when i was coming up i never understood it
i use to be like what they are so ungrateful why are they on drugs why don’t they fucking appreciate their success i would kill to be where they are until you get here and you are like lord is this the price i have to pay if i really want this
he’s like yup now let’s see who really want it
i think i became more than that because people cannot deny

[charlamagne]
you the shit
say it
you don’t have to be humble
be like ray j
i’m tired of being humble

[nicki minaj]

i just want you to know that i did it for you

i lost my little cousin to a senseless act of violence
his sister said he wanted to stay with me but i didnt invite him

family ties broken before me niggas tryna kill him he aint even call me
and thats the reflection of me yes i get it i get it it was all me
i pop a pill and remember the look in his eyes the last day he saw me

we know we know say fuck the world we ridin til the end
i know its sudden look at what weve become
i just want you to know that i did it for you

let me make this clear im not difficult im just about my business
im not into fake industry parties and fake agendas
rock with people for how they make me feel not what they give me
even the ones that hurt me the most i still show forgiveness
i love my mother more than life itself and thats a fact
id give it all if somehow i could just rekindle that
she never understands why im so overprotective
the more i work the more i feel like somehow theyre neglected
i want caiah to go to college just to say we did it
my child with aaron wouldve been sixteen any minute
so in some ways i feel like caiah is the both of them
its like hes caiahs little angel looking over him
and i know jelani will always love me and ill always love him
and im just his little sister not nicki minaj when im around him

[young buc]
im lovin how you look in my eyes
swingin them hips when you pass
im visualizing my name tatooed on that ass baby
jump on this harley
lets go smoke some of that bob marley
sip some bacardi
then go pull up at the afterparty
i think we make a perfect couple
but you think im trouble
maybe thats the reason you gave me the wrong number
she got me feeling like maybe she the wrong woman
think ima be chasin the chicken head you own somethin
your toes painted hair fixed all the time
and your gucci boots the same color as mine
if you read between the lines you can see that i want you
i betcha i have you doin what you said that you wont do
making decisions shorty good things dont last long
your girlfriend keep showin me that thong
before i head home
ima stop at your house and blow the horn
if you come outside you know its on holla at your boy

[chorus]

[lloyd banks]
bitches be frustrated with the baller
wonder why i dont call her
maybe because im busy and she needs someone to spoil her
it gets annoying from time to time i gotta ignore her
in order to let her know well be friends and nothing more
she loves it when im in town
hate it when im not around
i get her and wear down
next door neighbors hear the sound
pictures hittin the ground
just enough to hold us down
im stickin n moving cruising after the third round
just lay back baby and let me drive you crazy
i can make a 40 year old feel like a young lady

i admit i fell in love with her frame
and to make her feel special i let her call me by my government name
her panties wet over fame
fall in love with my chain
i wonder if i wasnt an entertainer would she remain
surrounding me hounding me trying to be my only
im not your boyfriend im your homie

[chorus]

[50 cent]
yeah what would fuck me up more
watching her lick her lips
or watching her walk she hypnotize me with her hips yeah man
i sweet talking her if she like
cause all she really want is a nigga to treat her right right
look im legit now used to break laws
now you can reap the benefit of world tours
big house big benz girl it yours
mink coats italian shoes stones with no flaws
you aint go to look like a model for me to adore you
all you gotta do is love me and be loyal
dont indulge in my past fuck what happened before you
cause their be some homies gonna hate you that never saw you
come here let my touch on you i let you touch on me
put my tounge on you you put your tounge on me
let me ride on you and you can ride on
we can do it all the night
we can have a balla tonight

[chorus]
