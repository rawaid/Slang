thats it turn the page on the day walk away 
cos theyre sensing what i say 
im 45th generation roman 
but i dont know em 
or care when im spitting 
so return to your sitting position and listen 
its fitting 
im miles ahead and they chase me 
show your face on tv then well see 
you cant do half my crew laughs 
at your roobarb and custard verses 
your rain down curses but im waving 
your hearse is driving by 
streets riding high with the beats in the sky 
all stare eyes glazed 
garage burnt down the fire raged 
for 40 days and in 40 ways 
but through the blaze they see it fade 
the sea of black the beaming heat on their faces 
their figure emerges from the wasteage 
eyes transfixed with a piercing gaze 
one hand clutching a sword raised to the sky 
they wonder how they wonder why 
the sky turns white it all becomes clear 
they felt lifted from their fears 
they shed tears in the light 
after 6 dark years 
young bold soldiers the fire burns 
cracks and smoulders 
5 years older and wiser 
the fires are burning on fire never tire 
slave warriors in the forests and on higher 
we sing hear the strings rising 
the wars over the bells ring 
memories fading soldiers slaying 
looks like geezers raving 
the hazy fog over the bull ring 
the lazy ways the birds sing 
a new babys born every day 
few men may be scorn today 
but look at things the other way 
cos it may well be your final day 
and then the crowds roar they slay they all say 
i produce this using only my bare wit 
gimme a jungle a garage beat and admit defeat 
use war and past injury as my metaphor and simile 
get all applications into before the deadline 
cos its a fine line between strife or crime 
and a life of crime 
but you will reach the day and its all mine 
you can take it or leave i shake 
and reveal stage tricks like jimi hendrix 
in the afterlife gladiators meet their maker 
thrown through the wind fields and lakes of bluewater 
to the next life from the fortress 
away from the knives and slaughter 
to their wives and daughters 
once more before the law judges over all of us 
cos in this place youll see me 
brace yourself cos this goes deep 
ill show you the secrets the sky and the birds 
actions speak louder than words 
stand by me my apprentice 
be brave clench fistshas it come to this

whether you white or black
smoke weed chase brown or toot rock
were on a mission
support the cause sign a petition
summon all your wisdom
the musics a gift from the man on high
the lord and his children

trip or team of your rudeboys
come rain or snow the boodah flows

stand on the corner 
watch the show cause life moves slow
sort your shit out and then roll
sex drugs and on the dole

we walk the tight rope of streed cred
keep my dogs fed
all jungle all garage heads
gold teeth valentinos and dreads now
verbally slapped up physically tip top
spinally ripped up
i do the science on my laptop
and get my boys mashed up

youre listening to the streets
youll bear witness to some amazing feats
bravery in the face of defeat
all line up and grab your seat
cos tonys got a new motor

drivin like a joyrider

my underground train runs from mile end to ealing
from brixton to bounds green
my spittins dirty
my beats are clean
so smoke weed and be lean

i step out my yard through the streets
in the dead heat
all i gots my spirit and my beats
i play fair dont cheat
and keep the gangsters sweet
turn the page
dont rip it out at your rage
move to the next stage
lock the rage inside the cage
like sk its a new day
but dont take the shortcut through the subway
its pay or play
these geeers walk the gangway
deep-seated urban decay
deep-seated urban decay
rip down posters alight from last weeks big garage night
and the next tyson fight
i cook em at 90 degrees fahrenheit 
and dont copy the copyright
i got em in my sights
blinded with the lights
taken to dizzy new heights

i excel in both content and deliverance 
so lets put on our classics 
and well have a little dance shall we 
no sales pitch no media hype 
no hydro its nice and ripe 
i speak in communication in bold type

then you go buy them 
theres no excuses my friend

that aint a bag its shipment 
this aint a track its a movement 
i got the settlement 
my frequencies are transient 
and resonate your eardrums 
i make bangers not anthems 
leave that to the artful dodger 
the broad shouldered 51% shareholder 
you wont find us on alta vista 
cult classic not bestseller 
your gonna need more power 
plug in the freephase and the generator 
crank it up to the gigawatts 
critics ready with the potshots the plot thickens 
put on yer mittens for these sub-zero conditions 
but remember im just spittin 
remember im just spittin 
once bitten forever smitten 

you say that everything sounds the same 
then you go buy them 
theres no excuses my friend 
lets push things forward

spilt jewels like eastern riches 
junkie fixes 
around ere we say birds not bitches 
as london bridge burns down brixtons burning up 
turns out your in luck 
cos i know this dodgy fuck in the duck 
so its just another showflick from your 
local city poet 
case you geezers dont know it 
lets push things forward 
its a tall order but were taller 
calling all maulers backstreet brawlers 
cornershop crawlers victorys flawless 
love us or hate us but dont slate us 
dont conform to formulas 
pop genres and such sharp darts double dutch 
parked cars troubles a much with more bud 
lets push things forward 

you say that everything sounds the same 
then you go buy them
theres no excuses my friend 
lets push things forwardchorus

out the club about three to the take-away
the shit-in-a-tray merchants shops got special perchant for the disorderly
geezers looking ordinary and a few looking leary
chips fly round the sound of the latest chart entry
an incendiary waiting to blast
no harm with the contest who can throw the furthest
behind the counter they look nervous but
carry on cutting the finest cuts of chicken from the big spinning stick
then over flies a chip flips and hits you on the back
you spin round on the attack
fuck you playing at he looks like a cheshire cat almost falls down
your frowns and superman eye lasers dont even register

and forever your gonna regret that your choice of path

so you owe someone money subbing scunny
best pay me billy - no worries
one-fifty on sunday
but in someway that turns into wednesday
then goes straight to pay on a hazy evening in the local bar-cafe
what a way what a way
just to recap for those at the back this is everyday tit-for-tat you owe your dealer and 
cant pay back fee
suddenly hes the baddy
so you tell your mates you could have him anyway to look geez
but hes a shady fuck beamer three series lock stock and two fat fucks backing him up
cant convey enough of his desire for the paper stuff
in a blunt fashion billys angry with a passion
so please just accept it aint happening
and go back to your runnins
cos you might get yourself in trouble one of these days

get hold of this bird after pub closing hours
would your girl like this no dont think so somehow in the winter showers
but shell never know and your face will never show shit
this is how goes it and besides she was well fit
and who could resist
move up to the next place a smooth club to flex bass beats and your best mates all down
nice sound smirnoff ice round
mcs clowning ruud boyz frowning
everythings sweet everythings tucked-in
and round here were all downing
but all of a sudden though just through the smoke is your bird laughing and joking with a 
bloke
aint just that either as she moves closer
miss-shape what looks like their lover - hes tonguing her
all rage sweeps up through your torso your moreso ready to go over and show him whos man
football fan style
leave it in the can for a while cos even as they smile you still got choices
dont listen to them voices
and at the end of the day you may just have caused this
so leave the forces

leave now dont be late
she said one day shed walk away
cause i was always late

thought things were okay
didnt care though anyway
say sorry babe i had to meet a mate
tempting fate

we first met through a shared view
she loved me and i did too
its now seven-fifty
getting ready better be nifty
do my hair quickly
step out its cloudy

mate bells me to borrow money
ive got two henrys and a dealer to pay
call up on geezers to rid these green trees
from my reeking jeans
got a you-think-i-care air
out glaring geezers stares

im here and im there
couldnt see past the end of my beer
what was gettin near
all of the silence after the tears

i didnt know that it was over
til it was too late too late
but if i ever needed you
would you be there

she said meet me at the gates dont be late
but pretty soon the day came for change
and i was glad she never walked away
so im choosing what to wear
doing my hair with an hour to spare
when my life went pear
shed been there with a fixed stare

big wheel climbed to the top
geezers stares bounced off
standin at the top of this huge mountain
smilin and shoutin
spring flowers sproutin

not one inch of doubt in my mind
as i reached the gates
came round the corner at a rate
risked her love
but i was gonna set things straight

never again am i gonna be late
never again am i gonna be late
never again am i gonna be late

i didnt know it was over
til it was too late too late
but if i ever needed you
would you be there

i said meet me at the gates
leave now dont be late
i waited for a while
listening to her voicemail
mind set sail

then the facts turned me pale
wind rain and hail
my fears unveiled for my fair female

shed walked away
too little too late
i step up the pace
walk past the gates

rain runs over my face
spirit falls from grace
i purchase a hazy escape at the alcohol place
in the chase

i sat down got a fat frown
weepin and drownin my senses
for this love games expensive

i walk in a trance
got a wounded soldier stance
and the everyday geezers stares throw me off balance

now nothin holds significance
and nothin holds relevance
cause the only thing i can see is her elegance

i didnt know that it was over
til it was too late too late
but if i ever needed you
would you be there

i didnt know that it was over
til it was too late too late
but if i ever needed you
would you be theresmell of good earthy herbs makes my nerves shudder 
but where were you that cold december 
cos we were in the grasshopper spending guilders
central station charged up like scarface 
amsterdam aint a nice place off your face 
we enter the race
walk down been there before done that 
no joy if youre bored lets go see roy 
get fucked up with the boys
calvin schmalvin im well within my limit 
oh hang on a minute these mushrooms just kicked in 
think i might be finished
the ball game heads for the worse for what its worth 
i might just fall off the edge of the earth brains kind of surfing now
we wander down darkened pathways in a daze 
want to buy any cocaine am i paranoid 
yes youre paranoid
charlie darling please save me this is raving 
take me home to my baby two bags of mushrooms 
rooms mushed up and i need a cradle

in its own little way 
my body was trying to say that you better stop drinking brandy

now getting to the bars gonna be trouble
so the marlonsll have to be doubles
then you drink doubles
the same speed you drink singles
ah beautiful the barman holds aloft the crystal glass 
and im having all thats in the bubble in the bottom of the bottle
then by three or four your heads a bit mangled
clubs full you mingle
you dance the fandango
you sing all your favourite jingles
far gone on one call me baron von marlon
one has a monocle and cigar
dickie-bow and long johns
my utility belt tells me its to the bar batman
fat cans of that lager then its straight to the dance-floor
for much more fancy footwork its adored by many amour
dont awe me with your little sidestep technique
get to the beat loosen up its the streets

in its own little way 
my body was trying to say that you better stop drinking brandy
in its own little way 
my body was trying to say that you better stop drinking brandy

we eat junk food sat drunk on the tube
every time the train clunks i feel like puking
wonder whether that beautiful birdll ring
then it all goes hazy these are the days 
were walking up out and back to the road talking
well shouting actually loads more drunk by jove 
minds focused balance fucked up
ra ra ra its all back to the dogstar 
and if its his round im quite partial to another marlon at the bar
bad idea to start again late 
shouldve given my brain a break
take it easy mate you start to think youre a state
you definitely are a state

my body was trying to say that you better stop drinking brandy

day in the life of a geezer
this is just a groove
just a groovehello hello my names terry and im a law abider
theres nothing i like more than getting fired up on beer
and when the weekends here i exercise my right to get paralytic and fight
good bloke fairly
but i get well lairy when geezers look at me funny
bounce em round like bunnies
im likely to cause mischief
good clean grief you must believe and i aint no thief
law abiding and all all legal
and who cares about my liver when it feels good
what you need is some real manhood
rasher rasher barney and kasha putting peoples backs up
public disorder ill give you public disorder
i down eight pints and run all over the place
spit in the face of an officer
see if that bothers ya cause i never broke a law in my life
someday im gonna settle down with a wife
come on lads lets have another fight

eh hello my names tim and im a criminal
in the eyes of society i need to be in jail
for the choice of herbs i inhale
this aint no wholesale operation
just a few eighths and some playstations mys vocation
i pose a threat to the nation
and down the station the police hold no patience
lets talk space and time
i like to get deep sometimes and think about einstein
and carl young and old kung fu movies i like to see
pass the hydrator please
yeah im floating on thin air
going to amsterdam in the new year - top gear there
cause i taker pride in my hobby
home made bongs using my engineering degree
dear leaders please legalise weed for these reasons

like i was saying to him
i told him fuck with me and you wont live
so i smacked him in the head and downed another carling
bada bada bing for the lads night
mad fight his faces a sad sight
vodka and snake bite
going on like a right geez hes a twat
shouldnt have looked at me like that
anyway im an upstanding citizen
if a war came along id be on the front line with em

cant stand crime either them hooligans on heroin
drugs and criminals those thugs on the penny coloured will be the downfall of society
ive got all the anger pent up inside of me

you know i dont see why i should be the criminal
how can something with no recorded fatalities be illegal
and how many deaths are there per year from alcohol
i just completed gran tourismo on the hardest setting
we pose no threat on my settee
ooh the pizzas here will someone let him in please
we didnt order chicken not a problem well pick it out
i doubt they meant to mess us about
after all were all adults not louts
as i was saying were friendly peaceful people
were not the ones out there causing trouble
we just sit in this hazy bubble with our quarters
discussing how beautiful gail porter is
mtv bbc 2 channel 4 is on until six in the morning
then at six in the morning the sun dawns and its my bedtime

causing trouble your stinking rabble
boys saying im the lad whos spoiling it
youre on drugs it really bugs me when people try and tell me im a thug
just for getting drunk
i like getting drunk
cause im an upstanding citizen
if a war came along id be on the front line with em

now terry youre repeating yourself
but thats okay drunk people cant help that
a chemical reaction happening inside your brain causes you to forget what youre saying

what i know exactly what im saying
im perfectly sane
you stinking student lame-o
go get a job and stop robbing us of our taxes

err well actually according to research
government funding for further education pales in insignificance
when compared to how much they spend on repairing
lairy drunk people at the weekend
in casualty wards all over the land

why you cheeky little swine come here
im gonna batter you come hereturn left up the street
nothing but grey concrete and dead beats
grab something to eat
maccy ds or kfc
only one choice in the city
done voicing my pity now lets get to the nitty gritty
tune reminds me of my first e
polite unique still sixteen and feelin horny
point to the sky feel free
a sea of people all equal smiles in front and behind me
swim in the deep blue sea cornfields sway lazily
all smiles all easy where you from what you on and whats your story
mesmerizing tones risin pianos this is my zone so stop clonin
pick paper scissors or stone
cause me and you are same ive known you all my life i dont know your name
the names european bob sorted anyway
gonna have dance now see you later pleased to meet you
likewise a pleasure

we were just standin there mindin our own
and it went on and on
we all smile we all sing
the weak become heroes then the stars align
we all sing we all sing all sing

we were just standin there mindin our own
and it went on and on
we all smile we all sing
the weak become heroes then the stars align
we all sing we all sing all sing

the night slowly fades and goes slow motion
all the commotion becomes floatin emotions
same piano loops over
arms wave eyes roll back and jaws fall open
i see in soft focus
chattin to this bloke in the toilets
dizzy new heights blinded by the lights
these people are for life its all back to his place at the end of the night
yo they could settle wars with this
if only they will imagine the worlds leaders on pills then imagine the mornin after
wars causing disaster dont talk to me i dont know ya
but this aint tommorow and for now i still love ya
hours fly over sail round diamonds and pearls never seen so many fit girls
discover new worlds look at my watch cant focus
last two hours i lost every move fills me with lust
all of lifes problems i just shake off
mad little events happen things map out and a few blue maddens alight the toilets
big beefy bouncers out to reveal us geezers on es and first timers kids on whizz darlings on charlie
theyve all come together for this party
all races many faces from places you never heard of
where you from whats your name and what you on
sing to the words flex to the fat ones
the tribal drums the suns risin we all smile we all sing

we were just standin there mindin our own
and it went on and on
we all smile we all sing
the weak become heroes then the stars align
we all sing we all sing all sing

we were just standin there mindin our own
and it went on and on
we all smile we all sing
the weak become heroes then the stars align
we all sing we all sing all sing

then the girl in the cafe taps me on the shoulder
i realize five years went by im older
memories smoulder winters colder
but that same piano loops over and over and over
the road shines and the rain washes away
the same chinese takeaway selling shit in a tray
its dark all round i walk down same sight same sounds new beats though
solid concrete under my feet
no surprises no treats the world stands still as my mind sloshes round
the washing up bowl in my crown
my lifes been up and down since i walked from that crowd

we were just standin there mindin our own
and it went on and on
we all smile we all sing
the weak become heroes then the stars align

out of respect to johnnie walker paul oakenfold

we all sing we all sing all singits who dares wins in the city
sit pretty
locked on not tripoli
get dressed for the party
as i spit simile after simile

got the latest nikes on my feet
the streets merely reflect this bass line and beat
lock on to 1026 the streets
kronenburg double doves and herbs actions speak louder than words
get fucked up sat on the curb
street geezers
accept me as your own
let me make myself at home
i just aint a clone
still got the monsta boy ring tone though
raised as a northern star
with a london underground travel cardcos this world swallows souls and when the blues unfold it gets cold
silence burns holes
youre going mad
perhaps you always were but when things was good you just didnt care 
this is called irony - when you most need to get up you got no energy
time and time shitll happen the dark shits unwrapping but no ones listening
your mates are laughing your brethrens fucking and then you start hating 
your stomach starts churning and your mind starts turning 
so smoke another draw it wont matter no more but the next day still feels sore 
rain taps on your window - always did though but you didnt hear it when things were so-so 
youre on your own now your little zone
you were born alone and believe me youll die alone 
weed becomes a chore you want the buzz back so you follow the others onto smack

just trying to stay positive
just trying to stay positive
just trying to stay positive
just trying to stay positive

feels nice and still good thing about brown is it always will 
its easy no-one blames you
its that world out there thats fucked you 
youre no less of a person and if god exists he still loves you 
just remember that - the more you sink the further back from that brink 
maybe youve lifetime scars and you think tattoos might be more fitting but whos picking 
searching for yourself you find demons 
try and be a freeman and grasp that talisman 
cos your the same as i am
we all need our fellow man
we all need our samaritan
maybe im better looking than you though 
maybe ive got more dough but am i happier - no 
get the love of a good girl
and your world will be much richer than my world
and your happiness will uncurl

just trying to stay positive
just trying to stay positive
just trying to stay positive
just trying to stay positive

stop dreaming - people who say that are blaspheming 
theyre doing nine to five and moaning
and they dont want you succeeding when theyve blown it
and you idols - who are they 
they too dreamt about their day
positive steps will see your goals 
whether its dollars or control feel the gold 
i aint helping you climb the ladder
im busy climbing mine 
thats how its been since the dawn of time 
if you reach a cul-de-sac the world turns its back 
this is your zone its like blackjack 
he might get the ace or the top one 
so organize your twos and threes into a run 
then youll have fucked him son 
and for that youll be the better one 
one last thing before you go though 
when you feel better tomorrow youll be a hero
but never forget today 
you could be back here - things can stray 
what if you see me in that window 
you wont help me i know 
thats cool just keep walking where you go 
carry on through the estate stare at the geezers 
so they know you aint lightweight
and go see your mates 
and when they dont look happy - play them this tape

just trying to stay positive
just trying to stay positive
just trying to stay positive
just trying to stay positive

i hope you understand me 
i aint no preaching fucker and i aint no do-goody-goody either 
this is about when shit goes pear-shaped
and if you arent or ever have been at rock bottom
then good luck to you in the big wide world 
but remember that one day shit might just start crumbling 
your bird might fuck off or you might lose your job 
its when that happens that what im talking about 
will feel much more important to you 
so if you aint feeling it just be thankful that things are cool in your world 
respect to bc
positivity
positivity
just trying to stay positivethis aint the down its the upbeat 
make it complete 
so whats the story
guaranteed accuracy enhanced cd 
latest technology dots at treble 20 
huge non-recoupable advance
majors or may just be vigilant 
i excel in both content and deliverance 
so lets put on our classics 
and well have a little dance shall we 
no sales pitch no media hype 
no hydro its nice and ripe 
i speak in communication in bold type 
this aint yer archetypal street sound 
scan for ultrasounds north south east west 
and all round and then to the underground 

you say that every thing sounds the same 
then you go buy them 
theres no excuses my friend 
lets push things forward

as we progress to the checkpoint 
i wholeheartedly agree with yer viewpoint 
but this aint your typical garage joint 
i make points which hold significance 
that aint a bag its shipment 
this aint a track its a movement 
i got the settlement 
my frequencies are transient 
and resonate your eardrums 
i make bangers not anthems 
leave that to the artful dodger 
the broad shouldered 51% shareholder 
you wont find us on alta vista 
cult classic not bestseller 
your gonna need more power 
plug in the freephase and the generator 
crank it up to the gigawatts 
critics ready with the potshots the plot thickens 
put on yer mittens for these sub-zero conditions 
but remember im just spittin 
remember im just spittin 
once bitten forever smitten 

you say that everything sounds the same 
then you go buy them 
theres no excuses my friend 
lets push things forward

spilt jewels like eastern riches 
junkie fixes 
around ere we say birds not bitches 
as london bridge burns down brixtons burning up 
turns out your in luck 
cos i know this dodgy fuck in the duck 
so its just another showflick from your 
local city poet 
case you geezers dont know it 
lets push things forward 
its a tall order but were taller 
calling all maulers backstreet brawlers 
cornershop crawlers victorys flawless 
love us or hate us but dont slate us 
dont conform to formulas 
pop genres and such sharp darts double dutch 
parked cars troubles a much with more bud 
lets push things forward 

you say that everything sounds the same 
then you go buy them
theres no excuses my friend

my favorite lighter seems to have done one 
cause it was here when you were here and now its gone 
now youre gone i mean just cause i bought you a drink 
im not trying to tie you to the seat i dont give to receive 
but you seem to live to recieve so i end up chatting to andy 
talking about his fucking grief with the knob you gave me for twos 

cause i cant be doing with your crap anymore 
so why dont you give me my lighter back

so why dont you give me my lighter back 
and then trackagain i step out my yard
head swings round clocks my landlord
start chippin up the road cos i owe him three-weeks dough

the ships sinkin teles on the blink
n in the pub its one beer to last all evening
later on chips for feedin

when the quids are down
try sneakin a bottle of brandy round bouncers into the ministry of sound
scored moffat back indoors with a profit
cos they do say havin no money forces one to make the right choices on life each day
if you cant pay you cant play

success hides a multitude of sins
but i aint successful and my piggy-banks still in the bin
been there since i was a kid

goin round in circles not being careful but say;
i get paid on friday cant wait to live life my way

cos on the streets im just a geezer
i gotta make ends meet yeah
gotta do what i need to
shit we all got our runnins now
on the streets im just a geezer
gotta make ends meet yeah
gotta do what i need to
shit we all got our runnins now

brut pocket im back in the burassic seat again
after spending sixty pound last week on beers with friends
brought it all on myself see granted
now im scorin draw for everyone to get my next spliff sorted
hang round mums house to get smothered
got no tins in the cupboard this week
hold on to your seat cos its all gone a bit pete
live for the moment said he *wrong*
downin beers out of my tree now the moments passed the cash is a distant memory
you know things are bleak when youre tellin the birds you asked out last week that things 

are busy
when really youve got no dough in the piggy
two days after pay days clocked
and its back at the black dog stuffin them socks into pool table pockets

*chorus*

im skint got no moolah
need to get some colour in my cheeks says mum
thatll be my english inner city tan
im skinny like a woman need to get some punan through the door
*please sir can i have some more*
oi
oi lend me a tenner so i can go to the chip-shop
twenty-four garage and then for a quick top
this time opting for the reassuringly cheap option

when the quids are down
my schott hoodies my ball gown
my essential accessory is my bad day frown cos
life in the third-class carriage can be evil
when your only ticket to freedom is a permit to travel
so uncle shiner you best go get the spade and dig me a grave
cos i cant pay the rent but i got  hundred-and-nine pound pair o trainers on

*chorus*

la la la
and then this geezer turned round to me and said
what are you doing you twat
and i was like
what the fuck is this what are you saying you div

that girl and she a smell it on her piece 
she must have crabs and fucking shrimp in her teethturn left up the street
nothing but grey concrete and dead beats
grab something to eat
maccy ds or kfc
only one choice in the city
done voicing my pity now lets get to the nitty gritty
tune reminds me of my first e
polite unique still sixteen and feelin horny
point to the sky feel free
a sea of people all equal smiles in front and behind me
swim in the deep blue sea cornfields sway lazily
all smiles all easy where you from what you on and whats your story
mesmerizing tones risin pianos this is my zone so stop clonin
pick paper scissors or stone
cause me and you are same ive known you all my life i dont know your name
the names european bob sorted anyway
gonna have dance now see you later pleased to meet you
likewise a pleasure

we were just standin there mindin our own
and it went on and on
we all smile we all sing
the weak become heroes then the stars align
we all sing we all sing all sing

we were just standin there mindin our own
and it went on and on
we all smile we all sing
the weak become heroes then the stars align
we all sing we all sing all sing

the night slowly fades and goes slow motion
all the commotion becomes floatin emotions
same piano loops over
arms wave eyes roll back and jaws fall open
i see in soft focus
chattin to this bloke in the toilets
dizzy new heights blinded by the lights
these people are for life its all back to his place at the end of the night
yo they could settle wars with this
if only they will imagine the worlds leaders on pills then imagine the mornin after
wars causing disaster dont talk to me i dont know ya
but this aint tommorow and for now i still love ya
hours fly over sail round diamonds and pearls never seen so many fit girls
discover new worlds look at my watch cant focus
last two hours i lost every move fills me with lust
all of lifes problems i just shake off
mad little events happen things map out and a few blue maddens alight the toilets
big beefy bouncers out to reveal us geezers on es and first timers kids on whizz darlings on charlie
theyve all come together for this party
all races many faces from places you never heard of
where you from whats your name and what you on
sing to the words flex to the fat ones
the tribal drums the suns risin we all smile we all sing

we were just standin there mindin our own
and it went on and on
we all smile we all sing
the weak become heroes then the stars align
we all sing we all sing all sing

we were just standin there mindin our own
and it went on and on
we all smile we all sing
the weak become heroes then the stars align
we all sing we all sing all sing

then the girl in the cafe taps me on the shoulder
i realize five years went by im older
memories smoulder winters colder
but that same piano loops over and over and over
the road shines and the rain washes away
the same chinese takeaway selling shit in a tray
its dark all round i walk down same sight same sounds new beats though
solid concrete under my feet
no surprises no treats the world stands still as my mind sloshes round
the washing up bowl in my crown
my lifes been up and down since i walked from that crowd

we were just standin there mindin our own
and it went on and on
we all smile we all sing
the weak become heroes then the stars align
we all sing we all sing all sing

we were just standin there mindin our own
and it went on and on
we all smile we all sing
the weak become heroes then the stars align
we all sing we all sing all sing

out of respect to johnnie walker paul oakenfold
nikki hollaway danni rampling
and all the people who gave us these times
and to the government i stick my middle finger up
with reguards to the criminal justice bill
for all the heros an that along the way

the weak become heroes then the stars align
we all sing we all sing all sing

the weak become heroes then the stars align
we all sing we all sing all sing

we were just standin there mindin our own
and it went on and on
we all smile we all sing
the weak become heroes then the stars align
we all sing we all sing all singoi oi oi
sometimes i look down sometimes i look up
sometimes i look down sometimes i look up
oi thats it

oi oi
im a fake
i don’t live the streets
but there’s only so many hours in a day and i use them to make beats
oi
in the studio immersed in
rehearsing
my technique
i live loops sleep snares and breathe beats
then sieve through
keep the best there
and only leave to eat
shut the door
pen and re-record the vocals just once more
and now you know why these walls are the only walls i ever saw
call me the quick draw mcgraw show but on logic audio

oi
kind of like a street score
though not the genuine article
more facts packed in a soundtrack to the acting
in a film and im the lead
believe me in a tragedy scene a tear ran down my cheeks
so cue the fairytale finale
listen to the dialogue
but not too deep
soak up the feeling
but dont quote me please

incidentally
dont worry about continuity
the person we hired to do that was relieved of their duties
also in the first scene my jeans are green
but then they change mysteriously to cream
again bad continuity
but i still mean what i mean
i wear nike a lot
my hoodies a tight schott
but does my life sound as interesting as a fight in a chip shop
i think not
the hypes not to be believed
i aint the archetypal street geez
but i am right on being a beat junkie
oi

i gave up the fight for an easy life a long time ago
when the last bird dumped me
buy me get one studio free
i use words for effect to illustrate passion
themes ring fact and specifics are usually fiction
oi oi
i probably couldnt tell you half of what
has it come to this means
i was simply setting a scene
of concrete
not sky and green trees

i still hold the same hundred feet high dreams
but a lot of things scare me though
i think i read somewhere recently that fear is a useless feeling because
i cant run to where im heading without running from where i was
its all because

where im from is not the issue
this is my imagination
i don’t sing the blues or feel fever
which by definition aint spoken truth either
it floats around places ive never even been to
so dont lean toward the door at four
just as the dance floor gets raw
some of the things this tour makes out id done been or did
wasnt me i werent the one
id only seen it
i was always too zoned-out on drum machine shit
to worry about the day to day out in the dosh pit

oi oi
flip the 12
this is the original mix
called
maybe my sarcastic brit twist on ting will be my downfall
oi
suddenly im defined by my lyrical
so i apologise for being so self-obsessed on this tune
let’s get back to the story soon as
the streets
the score
tell me what you think it is
cause i dont know anymorejust take back the dvd 
withdraw that extra money 
tell mum i wouldnt be back for tea 
then grab my savings and hurry 

so first to get the film back in time 
to avoid that big fine 
i had to do a fast hill climb 
but i fast declined 

but i flew a bit quick 
arms like a lunatic 
i had to stop for a few ticks 
i started feeling sick 

got to the video shop in a state 
but chuffed it wouldnt be late 
only when he flicked open the case 
id left the disc at my place 

today i have achieved absolutely nought 
in just being out of the house ive lost out 
if id wanted to end up with more now 
i shouldve just stayed in bed like i know how 

so i failed on the dvd 
but i still had to get the money 
tell mum i couldnt make tea 
get the savings and then hurry 

rushing to the cash machine 
still a bit mashed and lean 
and of course the mandatory car drives by 
and splashes me 

get there the queues outrageous 
ladys taking ages 
my rage is blowing gauges 
how longs it take to validate your wages 

at last my turn comes 
press the fifty squid button 

insufficient funds 

today i have achieved absolutely nought 
in just being out of the house ive lost out 
if id wanted to end up with more now 
i shouldve just stayed in bed like i know how 

so ive failed on the dvd 
couldnt withdraw any money 
but i still had to call mum 
get the savings and then hurry 

so to call my mum so that 
i could tell her i cant go and that 
at least i remembered my phone man 
i didnt know her number off hand 

wheres my phone have i got it 
oh this is a crock of shit 
i lost the fucking thing 
oh here it is in my pocket 

but the batterys nearly flat 
got to call quick snap 
oh shit 
the battery is flat 

today i have achieved absolutely nought 
in just being out of the house ive lost out 
if id wanted to end up with more now 
i shouldve just stayed in bed like i know how 

so ive failed on the dvd 
couldnt withdraw any money 
or call mum about tea 
id have to get the savings and hurry 

but where was the money 
i knew id left it on the 
side next to the tele 
this is not even funny 

id left it in the living room 
ready to pick up as soon 
as i pass through 
on the way to the rendezvous 

so the shoe box full of money 
just disappearing from me 
was not what i call funny 
a grand dont come for free 

today i have achieved absolutely nought 
in just being out of the house ive lost out 
if id wanted to end up with more now 
i shouldve just stayed in bed like i know how 

oi 
soaked to the bone in me jeans 
do you want me to stop 
i imagine me mums weeping right now 
a thousand pounds you swore that i left on the table this morn 
has simply disappeared right before my eyes his eyes and yours 
and im a thousand pounds poorer 
hundred thousand pennies no more 
a thousandth of a million squid or 2 monkeys or a whole fifty scores 
gone 
withdrawn from my life 
the money is no more for sure 

it was supposed to be so easycause the last relationship fucked her up
got hurt majorly finds it tough to trust
looked at the ashtray then looked back up
spinnin it away on the table top
she looked much fitter than saturday just
she worked in jds with dan
back then i figured she was pretty damn rough
but she was only wearin her work stuff
and in these clothes she looked more than buff
she stirred her straw sat up to adjust
i told her i thought it was important
that you could get lost in conversation
chattin shit sittin in oblivion
with that person whos your special one
she said she was the worst pool player under the sun
the blokes go easy so she always won

i saw this thing on itv the other week
said that if she played with her hair shes probably keen
shes playing with her hair well regularly
so i reckon i could well be in

she didnt look too bored with what i was sayin
hair looked much better than the other day
she had her fingers round her hair playin
i saw on telly thats a good indication
she didnt offer to buy the next drink though nay
but i suppose thats just a girls way
im tryin to think what else i can say
peelin the label off spinnin the ashtray
yeah actually yeah she did look pretty neat
her perfume smelled expensive and sweet
but i felt like my hair looked a bit shit
wished i had it cut back last week
she kept givin me this look as she would speak
was she only friendly or was she a keen
asked her if she wanted the same again to drink
just started to turn and get up out my seat

i saw this thing on itv the other week
said that if she played with her hair shes probably keen
shes playing with her hair well regularly
so i reckon i could well be in

she said that her close mates all were
always the most important thing to her
i said i thought it was a bit more blurred
she asked what i meant by that as she stirred
i told her about the money and what had occurred
with it goin missing from the living room side
with my best mates all there standin by
right where i left it under their eyes
so surely one of them might have spied
what happened to my money at that time
i felt like they were all smilin on the side
she was like fair play she couldnt say why
she didnt know what all my mates were like
and i said she just might be right
wish i had someone i could always rely
someone to get lost chattin to all night

i saw this thing on itv the other week
said that if she played with her hair shes probably keen
shes playing with her hair well regularly
so i reckon i could well be in

as i walked back with more drinks to our place
she had her phone stuck to the side of her face
i sat for a minute while she chatted away
about something with her mum and her birthday
played for a bit with the same ashtray
thought about things while i sat and waited
it was nice to chat about the shit in my head
someone who just listens to you instead
i looked to the barman wiping down again
looked at the football on the tv set
tryin to look like i werent just waitin there
for her conversation to come to an end
i looked at my watch and realised right then
that for three hours been in conversation
before she put her phone down she switched to silent
and we carried on chattin for more than that again

i saw this thing on itv the other week
said that if she played with her hair shes probably keen
shes playing with her hair well regularly
so i reckon i could well be in

i saw this thing on itv the other week
said that if she played with her hair shes probably keen
shes playing with her hair well regularly
so i reckon i could well be inchorus
its his lucky day thats a given 
hell tick the box on the slip and then just watch and learn 
hes not addicted he can stop any time 
but this is gonna pay he feels that this one will be fine 

this time i know im gonna smash the bet 
i foresee it smacked in the back of the net 
men grip slips wipe their hands with sweat 
the camera pans the away fans end 
twenty quid for blues who thrash the reds 
then cash that cash when the ref has said 
my mates out his pads a mess 
its getting late ive not dash yet 
oi the question i have to ask myself 
is can i see us not battering them 
if i cant see that happening then 
im gonna put all my money down on one fat bet 

now i dont know the first thing about football 
but my instincts tell me this is my windfall 

chorus
its his lucky day thats a given 
hell tick the box on the slip and then just watch and learn 
hes not addicted he can stop any time 
but this is gonna pay he feels that this one will be fine 

this time i know i woulda cashed the lot 
i woulda held in my hand the whole jackpot 
the games won the ends havent swapped 
two nil up theyre getting mashed up 
but i wont win now the chance flopped 
cause i couldnt make it to the damned shop 
might as well put tea in that pot 
i got nowhere else i have to bop 
the question i have to ask one 
is how i managed not to manage the trod 
maybe i can phone in and slap it on 
put all my money on a mid-match one 

yes i dont know the first thing about football 
but my instincts tell me this is my windfall 

chorus
its his lucky day thats a given 
hell tick the box on the slip and then just watch and learn 
hes not addicted he can stop any time 
but this is gonna pay he feels that this onell be fine 

hmm shit 
im mad glad i didnt back that match 
supposed to be a non-problematic catch 
full time the whistle blasted after 
the last pass had passed the last pass 
would you believe how we fell back 
three goals lost in the last half 
so glad i was stranded back at the flat 
wincing at every goal we let them have 
question i now have to ask 
is how the fuck did we get smashed that bad 
i just very very nearly nearly 
lost every penny of all my cash 

yes i dont know the first thing about football 
and my instincts almost lead me to a pitfall 

chorus
its his lucky day that was barmy 
he didnt tick the box on the slip and what a relief 
hes not addicted he can stop any time 
but next time he will be more lucky next time will be fine 

chorus
its his lucky day that was barmy

totally fucked cant hardly fuckin stand
this is fuckin amazing; rahhi should be standing at the bar waving a ten pound note around 
but i sit here on the sofa at my girls house 
i should be chatting shit as im nubbing out another stout 
but ill roach a spliff watching the tv for now 
i should be watching the fruit machines for which one will pay out 
but i sit on the sofa at my girls anyhow 
i should be legging it from a cab like a mad little lout 
but ill roach a spliff watching the tv throughout 

i know i never tell her but every single day man  
im always thinking loads about her 
shes the best thing that ever happened to me and 
i dont know what id do without her 

i should actually go out and about flip some beer mats 
instead of sitting here at my girls gaff 
cos all i seem to do is sit in this habitat 
just roaching a spliff watching the tv and that 
on the tv at my house theres a bit broken at the back 
so i use my girls tv to watch the match 
yeah i might head out later to get off this beaten track 
of watching the tv roaching up on the same old mat 

i know i never tell about every single day man 
im always thinking loads about her 
shes the best thing that ever happened to me and 
i dont know what id do without her 

but on second thoughts i wont do shots no i think i will 
sit on the sofa and eat my tv meal 
i would actually much prefer to just sit here and chill 
roaching a spliff watching eastenders or the bill 
cos basically i love her and i love been here still 
and i love sitting on the sofa with my girl for real 
i dont wanna knock my mates but there its the same old drill 
roaching a spliff watching the tv is my will 

i know i never tell about every single day man 
im always thinking loads about her 
shes the best thing that ever happened to me and 
i dont know what id do without her 

no fuck that i might ask my mates where theyll be drinking 
from the sofa giving them a ding 
tell em i will go threes on that gram later on this evening 
instead of roaching a spliff watching the tv again 
and then go out whilst back at hers she does her ting 
sitting on the sofa at her end 
but as i watch the big screen i know i will quite miss 
me and her roaching a spliff watching the tv again 

i know i never tell about every single day man 
im always thinking loads about her 
shes the best thing that ever happened to me and 
i dont know what id do without her 

ive got one packet of rizzla over there and its nearly run out

so there you go 
eh

cos dyou know what i mean 
youre not exactlyfuckinyknowdyou know what i mean 
it dont really matter anymore dyou know what i mean 
its hard enough to remember my opinions without remembering my reasons for them 
youre confusing me now 
im not gonna give you an example 
i cant remember an example 
you do it all the time 
you know that thing that you do 
ilook i cant remember when you last did it can i 
im gone anyway 
im never gonna darken your towers again ill tell you that 
and that thing about femme fatale yeah 
shes fit and shes fitter than you anyway 
i like her dyou know what i mean 
im never gonna meet her 
so before you get these jealousi like her yknow 

you can turn that offscuse me girl i know its a bit embarrassing but i just noticed some tan lines on your shirt

see i reckon you about an eight or a nine 
maybe even nine and a half in 4 beers time 
that blue top shirt top youve got on is nice 
bit too much fake tan though but yea you score high 
but theres just one little thing thats just really really really really annoying me about you ya see 
yeah yeah like i said you are really fit 
but my gosh dont you just know it 

im not trying to pull you 
even though i would like to 
i think you are really fit 
youre fit but my gosh dont you know it 

so when i looked at you standing there with your horde 
i was waiting in the queue lookin at the board 
wondering whether to have a burger or chips 
or what the shrapnel in my back pocket could afford 
when i noticed out o the corner of my eye 
lookin toward my direction your eyes locked on my course 
i couldnt concentrate on what i wanted to order 
which lost me my place in the queue i waited for yeah 

im not trying to pull you 
even though i would like to 
i think you are really fit 
youre fit but my gosh dont you know it 

woa 
leave it out 
are you smoking crack or something 
leave it out 
mike just leave it just leave it
we cannot have that behaviour in this establishment 
its not worth it mike 
leave it out 
just leave it 
dont touch me 
leave it out
dont touch me im alright 
dontlook im alright 

for a while there i was thinkin yeah but what if 
picturing myself pulling with bare white-heart wit
staring as you standing there opposite 
whether or not you knew it i swear you didnt tick 
and when that bloke in the white behind us lot queuing was clocking onto you too yeah 
i had to admit
that yea yea you are fit and yeah i do want it 
but i stopped sharkin a minute to get chips and drinks 

im not trying to pull you 
even though i would like to 
i think you are really fit 
youre fit but my gosh dont you know it 

now i bashed my head hard earlier due to the brew 
but i am digressing slightly so ill continue 
i didnt wanna bowl over all geezer and rude 
not rude like good but just rude like uncouth 
you girls think you can just flirt and it comes to you 
well let me tell you see yes yes you are really rude 
and rude as in good i knew she said as she queued 
but i just did not wanna give the satisfaction to you 

im not trying to pull you 
even though i would like to 
i think you are really fit 
your fit but my gosh dont you know it 

oi just as you started to make your big advance 
with the milkshake and that little doughnut in hand 
i was like nah i cant even no you look grand
but you looked sharp there smiling hard suggesting and 
leaning away with your hearty hearty lookin tan 
but i admit the next bit was spanners to my plan 
you walked toward my path but just brushed right past 
and into the arms of that fucking white shirted man 

im not trying to pull you 
even though i would like to 
i think you are really fit 
youre fit but my gosh dont you know it 

what do i give a fuck ive got a girlfriend anyway 
woah weve all had a drink mate 
oi were all a bit drunk weve had a few fair play 
ive got this stella i bombed from that last cafe 
this nights not even begun 
yes yes oh yay 

i did fancy you a bit though yea i must say 
i would rather i hadnt mugged myself on display 
but this is just another case of female stopping play 
in an otherwise total result of a holiday 

im not trying to pull you 
even though i would like to 
i think you are really fit 
youre fit but my gosh dont you know it 

haha
heh heh heh 

youre fit but you know it 
youre fit but you know it 
i think im going to fall over 
i think im going to fall o 

fuckin ellyeah safe man you ok 
just calling to ensure you got back in 
hope you coped yesterday cos i felt well damn grim 
but yeah in the air on the plane my stomach was turning 
man i was hanging 
head-to-sted on the headrest in pain 
prayed away all my bad sins 
lost count of the plain chardonnays before the fourth or maybe the fifth 
in future i need to abstain 
if only id had a bit of discipline 
but worth every bit of spare change 
pure clowning down to the last drink 

hang on let me slam the door mate; just pause that thought for a bit 

why did i have to go and do a stupid thing like that 
coz yeah it felt like we were through though 
but i couldve ruined it im such a twat 

ive been pacing the place well paralysed since i got back in with my bags though 
yeah im too aware that last night was way mad slack 
i know 
carried in a gang i lost sight of simone 
on her own back at home 
distracted from the fact it werent right 
could have raised up the hand but no 
simone was moaning and that about me playing away on this holiday 
she was watching the box at her dads house 
there preparing spliffs away 
as im smacking glasses down at george bests best session rate 

can you hear me na sorry mate your fuzzy mate i cant hear ya 

why did i have to go and do a stupid thing like that 
coz yeah it felt like we were through though 
but i couldve ruined it im such a twat 

i lost you for a minute yeah yeah i can hear you now 

see i mean that the true thing though i suppose i chose myself to allow 
i was weak and stupid but as far as i viewed anyhow 
she couldnt have been it for me the only girl id ever go out with 

i didnt want to waste my youth in a girls house to the sound of spliffs 
and when she got in a mood with me in that text about that thing 
i just switched off the phone when she started shouting 
coming to a conclusion i couldnt be bothered with anymore rowing 

why did i have to go and do a stupid thing like that 
coz yeah it felt like we were through though 
but i couldve ruined it im such a twat 

nah nah nah 

and then after shots made me lose the plot 
it all got a bit bizarre 
and that incident with the ice cream i forgot it all ended in our vodka 
what i can remembers a blotch 
i got a fat bruise on my arm 
she werent even much too hot but she totally mugged me up like rah 
she knew exactly what she was doing and it all went a bit too far 
she was with that bloke in the white top in mcdonalds car park 
and then she let me chat her up later on in that lovely little bar 

hello ahh fucking phones man 

why did i have to go and do a stupid thing like that 
coz yeah it felt like we were through though 
but i couldve ruined it im such a twat 

yeah i think we got cut off yeah i got crap reception in my house 
i have to stand in a certain spot in my kitchen or it cuts out 

yeah you know i was potty to even let myself allow it 
i would if i could just swap what happened then for right now 
and if she ever found out how far it got it would be more than just a row 
this whole thing just got on top but its her that i want no doubt 
so in a way its helped me doing wrong 
i know ive fucked up now 
this is where that dodgy shit stops 
shes just gotta not find out 

why did i have to go and do a stupid thing like that 
coz yeah it felt like we were through though 
but i couldve ruined it im such a twat 

why did i have to go and do a stupid thing like that 
coz yeah it felt like we were through though 
but i couldve ruined it im such a twat[mike]

[mike]

my cp coat is lyin just there 
draped over the edge of that dusty chair 
all fits into place suddenly 
yeh my coat was hangin up under my stairs 
but one day it went leaving the cupboard bare 
the facts all click in and become square 
he stole it while i was unaware 
but whys he denying it when its so bate 
looking at the telly wont look over straight 
whys he not flappin and explaining away 
to one very f**kin frustrated mate 
dans been trustin every word scott says 
he believes in mates so fair play 
but scotts story is too far outweighed 
and im gonna act before its too late 

i wish i could read what his eyes are sayin 
staring straight and not blinking 
hes not giving anything away 
what is he thinking what is he thinking
i wish i could read what his eyes are sayin 
staring straight and not blinking 
hes not giving anything away

[wayney g]
this must all look a bit weird 
its mikes cp coat sittin here 
draped over the chair 
so that it appears to all fit me up suddenly 
and clear im gonna have to just try and volunteer 
an answer bout the man who left the bomber here 
he mustve picked it up from mikes dear 
girls house when the weather wasnt clear 
the man mustve thought it was simones coat 
we didnt think it was mikes coat though 
i cant just deny it cos my face shows 
lookin at the tellys not aidin no 
i cant tell mike this man didnt know 
and innocently borrowed the coat at simones 
cos then mike would demand to know 
why this man was even at simones 

[[mike] that frown could mean anything 
[wayney g] what the f**k am i gonna do now he knows im lyin 
[mike] i wish i could read his mind 
[wayney g] its written all over my face 

i wish i could read what his eyes are sayin 
staring straight and not blinking 
hes not giving anything away 
what is he thinking what is he thinking
i wish i could read what his eyes are sayin 
staring straight and not blinking 
hes not giving anything away 
what is he thinking what is he thinking

[mike]

either he has gone john barnes 
or hes tryin to spin me a cons yarn 
he thinks hes the f**king don gar 
how long have i undergone his smarm 
shruggin it all off as fun charm 
if he dont stop lookin at the tv though 
im gonna wrap the cable round his wee throat 
hang on scott says simone had the coat 
where did he see her on the dlow 
what is it i dont need to know 
is he scheming to be near simone 
in the club i wondered what was on the go 
dan was tryin to keep scott from being close 
and scott teefed me money and his teefed me coat 
and hes trying to steal me girlfriend from under me nose 

i wish i could read what his eyes are sayin 
staring straight and not blinking 
hes not giving anything away 
what is he thinking what is he thinking
i wish i could read what his eyes are sayin 
staring straight and not blinking 
hes not giving anything away 
what is he thinking what is he thinking

[wayney g]
right i cant be bothered with this no more 
im gonna have to tell him i owe him the score 
i wish i could tell him about the dough on the draws 
thats somethin i dont know i swore 
the coat thing will look dodgy loads more 
if i dont throw it down as the crow soars 
id better put the video on pause 
face up toe-to-toe over the floor 
he really needs to know how his jacket 
miraculously appeared round my gaff here 
and the man that left its been shagging 
mikes girl behind mikes back and thing 
this shits all got a bit out of hand 
theres no options im all down on plans 
im jus gonna have to split it now man 
tell mike the person that bought the coat round 
wasdanin one single moment your whole life can turn round
i stand there for a minute starin straight into the ground
lookin to the left slightly then lookin back down
the world feels like its caved in proper sorry frown

please let me show you where we could only just be for us
i can change and i can grow or we could adjust
the wicked thing about us is we always have trust
we can even have an open relationship if you must

i look at her she stares almost straight back at me
but her eyes glaze over like shes lookin straight through me
then her eyes must have closed for what seems an eternity
when they open up shes lookin down at her feet

dry your eyes mate
i know its hard to take but her mind has been made up
theres plenty more fish in the sea
dry your eyes mate
i know you want to make her see how much this pain hurts
but youve got to walk away now its over

so then i move my hand up from down by my side
its shaking; my life is crashing before my eyes
i turn the palm of my hand up to face the skies
touch the bottom of her chin and let out a sigh

cause i cant imagine my life without you and me
theres things i cant imagine doin
things i cant imagine seein
it werent supposed to be easy surely
please please im begging please

she brings her hands up towards where my hands rested
she wraps her fingers round mine with the softness shes blessed with
she peels away my fingers looks at me and then gestures
by pushin my hand away to my chest from hers

dry your eyes mate
i know its hard to take but her mind has been made up
theres plenty more fish in the sea
dry your eyes mate
i know you want to make her see how much this pain hurts
but youve got to walk away now its over

and im just standin there
i cant say a word
cause everything is just gone
ive got nothin
absolutely nothin

tryin to pull her close out of bare desperation
put my arms around her tryin to change what shes saying
pull my head level with hers so she might engage in
look in to her eyes to make her listen again

im not gonna fuckin just fuckin leave it all now
cause you said itd be forever and that was your vow
and youre gonna let our things simply crash and fall down
youre well out of order now this is well out of town

she pulls away my arms are tightly clamped round her waist
gently pushes me back as she looks at me straight
turns around so shes now got her back to my face
takes one step forward looks back and then walks away

dry your eyes mate
i know its hard to take but her mind has been made up
theres plenty more fish in the sea
dry your eyes mate
i know you want to make her see how much this pain hurts
but youve got to walk away now its over

i know in the past ive found it hard to say
tellin you things but not tellin straight
but the more i pull on your hand and say
the more you pull away

dry your eyes mate
i know its hard to take but her mind has been made up
theres plenty more fish in the sea
dry your eyes mate
i know you want to make her see how much this pain hurts
but youve got to walk away nowif i want to sit in and drink super tennants in the day i will 
no-ones going to fucking tell me jack 
but can you rely on anyone in this world 
no you cant; its not my fault theres wall to wall empty cans 
everyone wanted this to all go wrong for me from the start 
its fucked up that a mans life can just be attacked 
watching this morning with a beer is much better relying on 
unknown cunts for mates i was given that dont have my back 
scott texted me to say hed have a look at the tv for me 
but i layed it down telling him to fuck right off chap 
phoned this company out the yellow pages; 
told them to take away the tv and fix it quick snap 
the next day they took away the tv and told me theyd repair the little bit 
thats broken round on the back 
i thought that would be that but the next bit was on top 
this was where it all started to get a bit out of hand 

no-one gives a crap about mike; 
thats why im acting nasty 
you know what you can do with your life; 
introduce it up your jacksie 
cause no-one gives a crap about mike; 
thats why im acting nasty 
you know what you can do with your life; 
introduce it up your jacksie 

the tv man comes back later knocks on mine 
to say hes found something in the back of the tv 
im looking at it absolutely speechless 
cant quite believe hes trying to pull this fucking stunt on me 
i knew it was a simple case of the power supply gone on the back 
but hes trying to tap me up for more money 
he says its not like that and im like fuck off and die 
and stick up my two fingers and one more to make three 
he says dont talk to me like that and i dont understand 
face is in his face and i tell him i understand perfectly 
and he grabs my shirt and i grab his face with my hand 
so he brings his fist up and twats me a good one on my cheek 
now im trying to pull his head down so i can knee it 
but hes got my ear; hes twisting it round so much that its really hurting me 
and we both go down on the floor and he pushes my head back; 
onto the corner of the fridge which is total agony 
then he gets up and runs out the kitchen and out of the door 
shouting stuff to me slams the door shoutin at me 
so here i am in my house drinking on my own settee; 
everyones a cunt in this life no-ones there for me 

no-one gives a crap about mike; 
thats why im acting nasty 
you know what you can do with your life; 
introduce it up your jacksie 
cause no-one gives a crap about mike; 
thats why im acting nasty 
you know what you can do with your life; 
introduce it up your jacksie 

break 

if i want to sit in and drink super tennants in the day i will 
no-ones going to fucking tell me jack 
but can you rely on anyone in this world 
no you cant; its all my fault theres wall to wall empty cans 
i sat in the kitchen all fucked off 
imagining over and over what theyre all doing behind my back 
dodgy things going on actions i regretted 
stain bottle with a pipe and tin foil on the matt 
scott texted me telling me hell have a look at the tv for me 
and i felt like just telling him to fuck right off chap 
but what he said about wanting to do the right thing by both mates 
and then opting to stay out - it seemed to match 
but is told him he could make it up by fixing the tv 
he said thats the least he could do to square things flat 
i thought that would be that but then the next bit was mad 
this is where everything started to all turn back 

the end of the something i did not want to end 
begining of hard times to come 
but something that was not meant to be is done 
and this is the start of what was 

he had to unscrew about fifteen screws before he could pull the panel off the back 
to get in the fecking thing; 
but just as he did so he said he saw something 
that slipped inside behind the panel - down the back of it 
must have been some leaflets or a bill maybe 
i didnt want to lose the bill incase it was a final warning 
so we both tried to get the back off and work out if there was any more screws to get out 
or if we left any in 
and when he looked down the back of the tv his eyes just froze 
before he rammed his hand in saying no shit 
hes looking at me absolutely speechless 
he cant quite believe what hes trying to pull out the slip 
i get up wondering what hes smiling about hes shaking his head at this point 
with the biggest of grins; 
i look down the back of the tv and thats where it was in all its glory - my thousand quid 

the end of the something i did not want to end 
begining of hard times to come 
but something that was not meant to be is done 
and this is the start of what was 

about 2 this afternoon the last of the people left my house 
cause they never stop chattin til all the rackets gone 
i really feel like things clicked into place at some point 
or maybe its the fact that me and alison really got on 
or maybe its that i realised that it is true; 
no-ones really there fighting for you in the last garison 
no-one except yourself that is no-one except you 
you are the one whos got your back til the last deeds done 
scott cant have my back til the absolute end 
cause hes got to look out for what over his horizon 
hes gotta to make sure hes not lonely not broke 
its enough to worry about keeping his own head above 
i shut the door behind me huddled up in my coat 
condensation floating off my breath squinted out the sun 
my jeans feel a bit tight think i washed them a bit too high; 
i was gonna be late so i picked up my pace to run 

the end of the something i did not want to end 
begining of hard times to come

and this is the start of what wasi get back from touring
and suddenly it doesnt seem like much fun to be off my face
at a quarter to eleven am

youre prangin out
i see through you
i feel awful
these voices talkin to me
this aint even funny
irons been on in my house for four fucking weeks
i see through you
im about to do something stupid

i dare say why my manager got lary and smacked me
these headaches are gettin unbearably nasty
staring at the crackwork lookin scary with me brandy
the rock n roll cliche walked in and then smacked me
carelessly rackin out prang just to handle the fear
i do a line but then panic and feel a bit prangy
so i glug marlon from the bottle to ease of the panic
then when it starts wearing off i just feel a bit sad
snort more tour support and then have a drink
the bruise on the side of my head is madly banging
the only reason i started this was the deal me a laughin
the only reason i started this was the deal me a laughin

youre prangin out
i see through you
these voices talkin to me
this aint even funny
i see through you
im about to do something stupid

the girl in my bed is kinda distant right now
i know shes thinkin shes a bit frightened somehow
i dont think she relised what id invited her back to my house
i dont want anyone to see me like this right now
all sorts thoughts rollin back in my eyes
ive been a poor sports thoughts dance in my mind
a banging headache dancin prang by their side
dancin with the pictures from the past of my life
i dont remember any of what i just thought at all
the conclusion prior to when i forgot it all
panicing a bit gettin frightened of fuck all
so nursing my bruise i drink right from the bottle
i dont want anyone i know to see my like this
my fibs in single became lies and lists
shes gonna sell tale no doubt fuck it
im not going to start drinkin no i cant for now

youre prangin out
i see through you
these voices talkin to me
this aint even funny
i see through you
im about to do something stupid

my laptop must have slipped down and gone to sleep
before the prangers pain was to dawn on me
stupid idiot
around the time i was skethchin tryin to con some sleep
and the new day on me was nearly dawning in here
i must have flaked while i imputed
waging loads more
cuz id staked on bookings
waging total score
why do i break my rules not to wager any more
i flaked on the bookings and majorly totalled on the score
ive got a simple problem
but my minds spinning out
i remembered the website between the wine and the stout
the rush of fear made me forget how fucked id been
this time im drying my eyes and a fuckin nose bleed
turnin the phone off when my promo bloke phones me
the day beforefor it got nasty with my manager when he only beat me
i threw his wallet out the window as it had grown heated
he said sort your life out as he punched me onto my feet

youre prangin out
i see through you
these voices talkin to me
this aint even funny
i see through you
im about to do something stupid

youre prangin out
i see through you
these voices talkin to me
this aint even funny
i see through you
im about to do something stupid

right now logic states i need to be not contemplating suicide
with rational thought it would seem that i need not to be doing stuff
that makes death seem like an easier option
i need a totally trojan plan right now
i see through youi dream that one day ill have a child
and that child will say to me dad what was war
but its not going to happen

its a war of the sexes never get it blud
i beg that you learn cause shes clever
how attracted to you she is is partly your gab
but its multiplied by how little of you she can have

oi the reason girls flirt is to work out their worth
whereas men just hanker for the panky to happen
retain this fact im hammering this fact is gonna matter
what little you think youre letting by her sly
she senses youre near her and smells your desire
the general rule of mine her intellect will be higher
your task is to make her notice you fast but hanker when you dont close in after
she knows she can get most dudes but she mustnt know about you
if you screw this all up and then lose all your cool thats when she ends up liking you as a friend
youre not playing at hard to get
youre playing at not getting a hard-on yet

its a war of the sexes never get it blud
i beg that you learn cause shes clever
how attracted to you she is is partly your gab
but its multiplied by how little of you she can have

and you wanna know what listen

the answer is to get close enough to her but listen the next thing you just totally blank her
you think im fucking mad dont ya but i dont shag on my own
get somewhere close to the lamb but then glance and turn to the man
you need to get near to the lamb but she doesnt want to feel cramped
instead of cowering up to the hostile lamb bowl up to the trusting man
its much easier talking to him he doesnt suspect you want anything

just tell him something like
did you know cigarette lighters were invented before matches
its abc making a he break with glee
cos he isnt suspicious youre trying to muscle into his misses
do you know what im talking about thats why im talking about

its a war of the sexes never get it blud
i beg that you learn cause shes clever
how attracted to you she is is partly your gab
but its multiplied by how little of you she can have

the woman is a highly socially-practised
master in body language dab-handed actress
shes calculating all the mad facts and the figures
while youre pretending to listen staring at her tits

its a war of the sexes never get it blud
i beg that you learn cause shes clever
how attracted to you she is is partly your gab
but its multiplied by how little of you she can have

its a war of the sexes never get it blud
i beg that you learn cause shes clever
how attracted to you she is is partly your gab
but its multiplied by how little of you she can have

elementary my dear cousin elementary
i cannot state this enough
she must not clock your flop
you cant placard your march
your threws seclude your moves
or youre colluding well weapon

its a war of the sexes never get it blud
i beg that you learn cause shes clever
how attracted to you she is is partly your gab
but its multiplied by how little of you she can have

and remember not to get hammered either
cause people who get hammered dont get to naili need something in my life to straighten me out
lets rent this shed well do vocals in the bog
call toast pr tell em weve opened up shop
campaign meetings at warner no coke and not drunk
3 years to make this work or look a joke and be broke
blag their lawyers like the con with a dog
and therell be no more straight scores to drop and keep dropping
settle my gross addictions with my net and come
tell my mum over tea that my whole lifes fucking up
weve got two fifty grand in the budget to go
subtract five for club promo
lose five for a good video and fifteen for a dud video fuck that

its the hardest way to make an easy living
the party stage is a bit nearer to delivery

mayhem textes me about the press and tv
see if ive taken any es
so i can get some sleep
nap on the settee the laptop next to me
wince for my family at the skinner scandal of the week
tv pluggers product managers straight up
club promo needs to step up help it work
stick to our guns dont crack to demands
tell my mum in the car that the car might have to go back
two hundred and twenty five grand
twenty six grand for a showcase
and five more on tour support and support story

its the hardest way to make an easy living
the party stage is a bit nearer to delivery

well never get bankrupt if we never have a go
this is no ordinary able i need to flash up my flow
go into morris stead as well as saville row
i want a pin-stripe suit that no man owns
cash in the kano beat for the silver shadow
send it to warrior for the flash and the glow
the safest way to double your money is to fold it in your pocket
tell my mum during breakfast that i got no sleep
eight grand paid in september april may and december
if this keeps going so well this is going to be the end of us

its the hardest way to make an easy living
the party stage is a bit nearer to delivery

in spread betting its easy to draw a small fortune start
with a big fortune and lose into a small fortune
havent got a clue we blindly charge on
death threats from a boy of the girl i sarged on
she said she didnt have a bloke another lesson marked down
verbal agreements arent worth the paper theyre marked on
get scans of reviews we beg to chart up
tell my mum over tea the press have started up
weve spent a fortune
cause with ghost buying its the end for tune
we need to sell some records soon

its the hardest way to make an easy living
the party stage is a bit nearer to delivery

its the hardest way to make an easy living
the party stage is a bit nearer to deliverycan you blatantly say looking straight in her face that you aint telling tales to her

if you never tell a lie to her
you dont have to remember anything
but it all goes out the window when
i try to do it myself

oi oi can you blatantly say looking straight in her face that you aint telling tales to her
that you never get stressed when she questions events youll be best to forget
can you actually blag when the lamb glances when you prang and your chatting
that if you had the chance to go back to her pad for a passionate act you wouldnt have it oi whys that then

thats cause the reason you been faithful is
youve been so good
cause youve never seen temptation
deep down you hear the mans burden
we all have a mans burden
youll always be a bad person

its getting you down
you were letting her down
you were tempted and you bowed
you shown her up
you need to be owning up
you need to show her you love her for once
it was an extreme circumstance
it was she that advanced
she defeated you gradually
so you must then be honest
you must then get on this
mend the wrong shit

if you never tell a lie to her
you dont have to remember anything
but it all goes out the window when
i try to do it myself

oi oi so why you wanna phone up
why you wanna own up
you were selfish and so dumb
to ease it off ur chest
to be relieved of the mess
thats being proper selfish
i been in some broken moments
i know what goes on the road
but theres a road you chose
however coked up your brain
you know you chose to strain
she knows your game oi

but it makes you see things clearer
it was weird though man
but you didnt wanna be with her
seriously back home
if a girl was to even hear
it would spare her weak heart
and shed have no fear

the chance to see the fit thing naked will spell and memorizes you
youll disregard the ways the lady in your life inspires you
which is why the day she tires of you youll be crying and howling
and if you have the chance to go back to her pad for a passionate act you wont allow it
but if your plans for the chance to go back is not even had
then the passionate act wont happen
cause you plan not to have the chance rewind back if that sounded fast oi
you cant think straight
you gotta avoid the situation forget what shes doing
you may be mugged if you trust too much but it will fuck you up more worrying about trust

if you never tell a lie to her
you dont have to remember anything
but it all goes out the window when
i try to do it myself

if you never tell a lie to her
you dont have to remember anything
but it all goes out the window when
i try to do it myself

you may be mugged if you trust too much
but it will more fuck you up
it will more fuck you up worrying about trustah what was the question
oh yeah momento mori
it means remember its inevitable that we will all die
it sounds quite depressing when said so raw and direct
but it means dont hang yourself on a material life
but that gets dropped when im bop on shopping day
am i shallow am i hung up on such wrong ways
yes i am shallow and loving every wrong play
if love is blind then why do we all buy lingerie
ive got nothing in my life away from the studio
so when im loose i end up consuming dough

memento mori memento mori
its latin and it says we must all die
i tried it for a while but its a load of boring shit
so i buy buy buy buy buy buy

if i start to think of life i have prangs of paranoia
pull one stripey shirt off a racks or another
overthink my fate grasping a pastel jumper
panic buy a flight home prang though actually sober
change my mind and fly back into vegas
buy more pastel shades and some famous labels
frame the ferrari through the day with the mayhem
just to forget about the race in my head
i dont really care about the luck and the look
but driving a ferrarri is f**king book

memento mori memento mori


its latin and it says we must all die
i tried it for a while but its a load of boring shit
so i buy buy buy buy buy buy

i think if i could see me now from my growing past
id hate the shirted cunt that seems to be so f**king flash
i reckon from the threadsi think all i thinks about cash
but my manager tells me i ought to think about cash
its like people dont know the eighties started
my car just keeps carding with the card machine
you dont regard the old you driving a ferrarri
mines the driving license through nevada at speed
i never think about money
in fact i have no idea how much money i have

memento mori memento mori
its latin and it says we must all die
i tried it for a while but its a load of boring shit
so i buy buy buy buy buy buy

chilly n carmen air sips as im parting her hair
but im an asbo drinker i want to be chilly parkair
but asbo drinkers just dont dig my art and my flair
even if they dig my asbo driving past their carlight flair
sometimes when i my diamond trinkets with my whores
i know ive strayed a bit from my old sins and my walks
but then i laugh out loud that my car still f**king talks
i feel awful for a bit but at least im not poorusing the following im going to show you

a how to con someone using their own greed
b that you wont feel bad cos theyre trying to con you anyway and
c taking their money

as i have come to realise running the beats is just getting peoples confidence

this scam only works cos that man thinks hes working this scam
and that you man off his mark
get your mate lets call your mate piers
no not piers lets call him farquhar
anyway get farquhar to crawl into a bar with his dog
like i said the barman will try and con you later
but youre gonna take all his money
anyway get farquhar to pass into a local bar
and call to the bar to look after a dog for a dart
just for 20 quid for a while claiming that he hated it
but it was worth more than his car
this by the way requires that you find and supply farquhar
with an animal and a life from your local park
get a nice dog that doesnt bark
but not so nice that someone might miss this mutt from the park

anyway using this technique youre gonna take all this mans money
but youre not gonna care cos hes gonna fucking deserve it

chorus
youll never con an honest john
an honest john you cant drag down exactly
con-do-lee get conned
when they think theyre the cunning one its all one big con
neighbour you wont con
an honest john

now listen get farquhar to dart out the bar
and just shop for some garms maybe
just to pass an hour or so
i would go shopping cos i gave up drinking
but whatever just have farquhar down the road
now you walk in the bar walk up to the barman
order a jar when youve caught him slouched on his own
start eyeing the dog that hes minding by his side
currently vibe him and start on about the dog you own
start asking the barman if its his fine specimen of a dog
nod smile agree look interested and cool
when he tells you its someone elses youve just left previous
tell him this is a very rare breed of animal
last time i lied my manager swiped me
but lie and tell him its like a fucking red-eared hunting spaniel
tell him its worth 600 quid and you would pay handsomely if you were to accept finance at all

chorus
youll never con an honest john sometimes
an honest john you cant drag down  sometimes i think i should just go completely
condolee get conned
when they think theyre the cunning one
neighbour you wont con an honest john keep listening though its important that you keep listening

now take all his shopping off him
get your mate farquhar to pop in
looking straight gutted a bit later on
he should order a jar talk at the bar
ensure he looks calm warm with the barman
and generally start conversating on
farquhar should start falling apart
about how hes arsed up some chance
and how arsed up his day was
or in the event the spread betting hes getting ready to accept
that his rents not getting payed up
the barmans mind will chime slowly for a while
he might wipe the bar as his mind is making sums
farquhar should continue to moan about money
and that this mutt is not the greatest of his worries
and like ching the barman will five out of six times
kindly offer his greed to buy the dog for a price of 300 quid
and after some bartering your barman will haggle and charge harder
in greed of the scent of the scheme in his head thats right neighbour

youll never con an honest john
an honest john you cant drag down
condolee get conned
when they think theyre the cunning one
the barman is gonna see how much he can stitch you up for
neighbour you wont con an honest john
how does that work cos everytime its based around someone who thinks theyre conning you

theyll never imagine the whole scenario is prepared solely for him
why should he
that sort of paranoia can get you in the loony bin

as i have come to realise running the beats is just getting peoples confidence
and than taking their money

its all one big conahhh see
right see the thing thats got it all fucked up now is camera-phones
how the hell am i supposed to be able to do a line in front of complete strangers
when i know theyve all got cameras

when youre a famous boy
it gets really easy to get girls
its all so easy you get a bit spoilt
so when you try to pull a girl
who is also famous too
it feels just like when you wasnt famous

the celebrity pages in papers dont tell tales that are always to the line of the truth
its til a line at which most likely youll have the time or enough finance to sue
which is why its so frightening buying papers in the morning fearing the next mike skinner scoop
cos i used to believe what i read so now i know that others will believe that its true

but i realised with you the truth could be a whole lot worse than the flack
my whole life i never thought id see a pop star smoke crack
and i must admit i was quite shocked with that thing you did with me on my back
but outside in the lobby i shouldnt have laughed when you slapped that man

when youre a famous boy
it gets really easy to get girls
its all so easy you get a bit spoilt
so when you try to pull a girl
who is also famous too
it feels just like when you wasnt famous

you were so much fun
i really got to like you more than you liked me
i really hoped that youd stay
considering the amount of prang youd done you looked amazing on cd uk
you learn dances do promo cameras flashing get in the van an zoom away
i wake up high dizzed feel hung over and sorry for my doomed day

but i know i got a bit close to you and that you found it fucking boring
you taught me so much about how to deal with the fire id fallen in
and what version of a rumour would be next day everyones story of me
you taught me all the realities and turn the page &amp; ignore em

when youre a famous boy
it gets really easy to get girls
its all so easy you get a bit spoilt
so when you try to pull a girl
who is also famous too
it feels just like when you wasnt famous

anyway i had to rest my beer hat delete my dealers number and unroll my bank notes
and we were on borrowed time anyway what with the daily toilet papers not knowin
and i knew that when the people who thought they knew you when they found out i wouldve been mocked
which is ironic cos in reality standing next to you i look fucking soft

whenever i see you on mtv i cant stop my big wide smile
and past the childrens appeal i see the darkness behind
we both know the scratches on my back much better than the alludes and lies
i miss the bitchin and shoutin but im glad i got out in time

when youre a famous boy
it gets really easy to get girls
its all so easy you get a bit spoilt
so when you try to pull a girl
who is also famous too
it feels just like when you wasnt famous

you cant keep fucking pop-stars
weve got a fucking business to run
there are industry repercussions michael
i knowtwo great european narcotics
alcohol and christianity
i know which one i prefer

we never went to church
just get on with work and sometimes thingsll hurt
but its hit me since you left us
and its so hard not to search

if you were still about
id ask you what im supposed to do now
i just get a bit scared
every now
hope i made you proud

on your birthday when mum passed the forks and spoons
i put my head on the table i was so distraught with you
you tidied your things into the bin
the more poorly you grew
so theres nothing of yours to hold or to talk to

youd put your hand up and interrupt the conversation with a but
people say i interrupt people with the same look
sometimes i think so hard i cant remember how your face looked
started reading about dreams in your favourite book

i panic and pace when i cant see the right thing to do
youd be scratching your head through the best advice you knew
and i feel sad i cant hear you reciting it through
i miss you dad but ive got nothing to remind me of you

we never went to church
just get on with work and sometimes thingsll hurt
but its hit me since you left us
and its so hard not to search

if you were still about
id ask you what im supposed to do now
i just get a bit scared
every now
hope i made you proud

i needed a break when your book about dreams was taken
i needed to pray or see a priest that day
i needed to leave this trade and just heave it away
but i cleaned up my place like you so i could see things straight

i never cared about god when life was sailin on the calm
so i said id get my head down and id deal with the ache in my heart
and for that if god exists id reckon hed pay me regard
mum says me and you are the same from the start

i guess than you did leave me something to remind me of you
everytime i interrupt someone like you used to
when i do something like you youll be on my mind or through
cause i forgot you left me behind to remind me of you

we never went to church
just get on with work and sometimes thingsll hurt
but its hit me since you left us
and its so hard not to search

if you were still about
id ask you what im supposed to do now
i just get a bit scared
every now
hope i made you proud

we never went to church
just get on with work and sometimes thingsll hurt
but its hit me since you left us
and its so hard not to search

but you you still tell me how you didnt know what to do even now
and then im not so scared somehow
cause i know that youd be proud

i got a good one for you dad
im gonna see a priest a rabbi and a protestant clergyman
you always said i should hedge my betsthe fine art of hotel expressionism
pen a sentiment with the kettle and condiments
compose your mood using the soap hanging chute
the minibar can be part of the art

in the early hours of a blurry hotel you need guests of 
my word is word if we earn success in hotel expressionism 
stay away from  hotels so when wrecked theres no victim
ive been ejected from hotels that then when im checking in will swear to be with them swearin
man im not some crank vandal swinging the tv about at random 
attacks to the lampstand for a  is the art of action prove 
tediously mischief from  is why we hide from enemy pages
throwing the tv out the window mate is nothing clear of weak cliches
its vandalism and expressionism is keendly disasociated 
im talking incontrovertible talking

the group of girls your so in on have to be on there oh there and piss


but you have a problem with the man there with hes a dealer but theres a rift
you need to get infront jump up on his own shit take his gear he disappears

ill tell you
expressionism is his own form of art
because with normal art someone usually the artist they pour out their heart
but its worth is decided by committin and has to obey the law and sharks
i tell expressionists walk out the lift mind checkin out pay for their art
real art should be nothing but love shouldnt be about the money or fashion
i make these crap rap rhythms to pay the hotel bills that fund my packet

the fine art of hotel expressionism
pen a sentiment with the kettle and condiments

oi oi brought down the day before the crafts 
the hats were made by warner staff 
thought they were fakes not thought to ask
so i tirade the audience found under the stage but id only just spoken 
ted mayhem has never seen me so darn broken
the very next day in bed in london 
with a girl i have little memory of
unable to feel anything much which was the reason why i bought my first suit

some days i feel im getting smaller and smaller
but some nights i seem to grow taller and taller
and we keep shrinkin and shrinkin but this will not finish
youre never nothing if you didnt disappear
just when i discovered the meaning of life they change it
just when im loving life it seems to start raining
i pulled the sail safe switch sea sail and im aimed at the stars
i love the rain on my scars the skys now red my eyes reflect jest
smiling at this blessing this life is the best

refrain
i came to this world with nothing
and i leave with nothing but love
everything else is just borrowed

i want to notice chances ive passed without notice
i want to see details previously veiled
i want to grab that chance carry it home
so i can marry and know
that i noticed every chance 
that i could have passed without notice
i saw details that to all were veiled
and i grabbed those chances carried them home
and then ill have had it with roaming

refrain
i came to this world with nothing
and i leave with nothing but love
everything else is just borrowed

i want to speak every cliche but tweak if ive seen change
in a new way it could be said
if its bleak or if the weeks leaking down the street
or if any days wasted i want to face facts
my time on this earth is my only penny
wise is the gent counting every moment spent
i dont want to explain things dont wanna fill in the gaps
i want to look at my friends and in that minute be at

girl singing
memories are times we borrow
for spending tomorrow
memories are times we borrow
for spending tomorrow

refrain
i came to this world with nothing
and i leave with nothing but love
everything else is just borrowed

its a bit like luck you can only seem
to borrow it you cant keep it
when the wind of change whistles into play
will i blink or flinch away
the wind of change wont whistle me away
if i spin my tails and sail
and sail away let yesterday become today

refrain
i came to this world with nothing
and i leave with nothing but love
everything else is just borrowed

as time will say nothing but
i told you so

girl singing
memories are times we borrow
for spending tomorrowi want to go to heaven for the weather
but hell for the company
i want to go to heaven for the weather
but hell seems like fun to me

theres something in the sun this day i feel it
or maybe its just my hay fever
the weeds are green the sky is shining
but itll soon be night which is nicer
but then cracks peel back and hell bends the room
and the devil gestures to you
youve never seen such a beelzebee
and hes telling you to make up your bean about whats left of your evening
about whether to flake out or fecking stay out
what do you make of this doubt
the devil wants to know if youre going down or up
easy - i know what my speech should be

i want to go to heaven for the weather
but hell for the company
i want to go to heaven for the weather
but hell seems like fun to me

the devil beams a big beaming grin
the sort which leads you up the streets of sin
he holds up paperwork - sign the line
lets clash with madmen grime is fine
it sounds all hectic youre having cold feet
things are getting out of hand you make an embarrasing retreat
lets ride the valkyrie commit a bit of sin
turn rock to rubble punch me in the chin
i simply lucifer refuse to wind up on fire with low-life liars
then youre destined for the world without chores and sweating -
the eternal hell of boredom in heaven

i want to go to heaven for the weather
but hell for the company
i want to go to heaven for the weather
but hell seems like fun to me

you tell the devil in no uncertain terms
youll never be evil youll never be turned
what is this evil and who decides this
when left to devices some humans try shit
this is the reason we should all be tied up
were just normal people exploring our minds
we dont go around here putting poison in wine
but we enjoy what we like which is not always right
people are intricate people arent swines
lets screw the rules up and rely on our minds
sign on the line
you sign on the line
he clutches the wine and tips it in cyonide

i want to go to heaven for the weather
but hell for the company
i want to go to heaven for the weather
but hell seems like fun to me

i want to go to heaven for the weather
but hell for the company
i want to go to heaven for the weather
but hell seems like fun to me

i want to go to heaven for the weather
but hell for the company
i want to go to heaven for the weather
but hell seems like fun to mewe havent even started and its almost the end
we never talked it over in fact we never said anything
two of the same kind of sorts hiding thoughts
as the small talk ebbs away the silence is awkward
you hardly even know me and im starting to show that
i hardly even know you but i like what i know
i want to talk about it but i quake in my skin
itll only push you further into making decisions
you want to like me but you were likely undecided
the voice inside mes always right which is why the awkward silence
not gonna risk losing you
which is why im never gonna woo you

i think i love you more than you like me
although im never surer maybe i should want to be blind
i think i love you more than you like me
because this is even crossing my mind

any other day and youd have not looked twice
the joking went along with my roll of the dice
purely by chance i happened on feeling
really confident around the place and people
you caught a no-hitter hitting winning strokes
i never am a winner im a lonely bloke
acting exciting like a man for a while
until you realised i can act like a child
eternal optimism is spurring me onto think that acting on yearnings like this might lead me to learn a secret
but i dont really know
or why i think so
its just a good hunch hunches are always right though

i think i love you more than you like me
although im never surer maybe i should want to be blind
i think i love you more than you like me
because this is even crossing my mind

i drew a drawing of you after last time i saw you
i never felt to draw a picture like that before
i learnt a lot about myself drawing all morning
it was absolutely shit im awful at drawing

i think i love you more than you like me
although im never surer maybe i should want to be blind
i think i love you more than you like me
because this is even crossing my mind

i think i love you more than you like me
although im never surer maybe i should want to be blind
i think i love you more than you like me
because this is even crossing my mindeverybody do the dodo

its not earth thats in trouble
its the people that live on it no no
earthll be here long after weve all gone the way of the dodo

i cant imagine the day when things have actually faded away
but the day i may not be able to pay my way could be today
its not that i dont care just that im way too caught up with breathing air to grieve for the trees and air or how breathable air is
you go first ill follow suit
make your mistakes ill copy mate
im right behind you but dont expect me to ride like its a race
cause youll be back there picking scraps while im mr mug do-gooding around and ive lost my rank and place
ive got to manage my little space

its not earth thats in trouble
its the people that live on it no no
earthll be here long after weve all gone the way of the dodo

its not earth thats in trouble
its the people that live on it no no
earthll be here long after weve all gone the way of the dodo

im not a stereotypical give-me-what-i-want-when-i-want-it with a big cherry on it
just another brother trying to love my son and mother
providing for my wife is the vibe im on in life
i might well starve thats what would happen if i started off this march
its not my world but im in it to win it
put it in the bin if you give a shit listen lets all start at the same point
following rules equally losing tell me if it does i wish it be true but never gonna happen we are not equal
for the kids lets make the rules
but i saw the film and hated the sequel

its not earth thats in trouble
its the people that live on it no no
earthll be here long after weve all gone the way of the dodo

its not earth thats in trouble
its the people that live on it no no
earthll be here long after weve all gone the way of the dodo

follow me follow me watch this *garbled* can do the dodo follow me

everybody do the dodo

you and me are family
pass the love round then back to me
two and three thats the feeling
scramble for the top for the bottom of the ceiling
conspiracy theories we all hear these
we all see the deal
we will seal the deal
if you dont know where youre going any road will take you there
if you dont know where youre going then any road will take you there
if you dont know where youre going then any road will take you there
we do not know where were going
any road

its not earth thats in trouble

these are my wings this is my beakfrom the point he gazed from the choice was made but walk the cave or the shore
the oily cave seemed to breathe on him through gravestone jaws
his little hand grasped in anguish as he weighed up his coin
somewhere a blue-eyed girl in the world is just waiting for a boy
footprints trailed as if trod by slaves up to the grey cave floor
but not one graze from anything ever escaping this fort
so with coin on hand his joy came back when ordered to take the shore
why on earth as he wandered the warmth am i obeying this coin

turn your life on the flip of this coin
turn upside a choice youd normally avoid
and promise me youll follow what it says
whatever it says

again walk within the trusted beach or swim the swell of the sea
and again the scarier alternative looked like certain death to he
hed never learnt to skill of swimming - it never occurred to be very easy
and again he winced as he flipped the coin and it twirled to his feet
how is this sane he blamed the coin now aiming for the waves
as he hesitated at the swirl of water as it raged and rained
blue-eyed girls were waiting and he was drowning in the spray
blue-eyed girls he should have been acquainted with but for shouting and flailing

turn your life on the flip of this coin
turn upside a choice youd normally avoid
and promise me youll follow what it says
whatever it says

he finally slugs it back to land feeling chewed-up and foolish
empties his pockets on the sand spewing a pool each
staggers back to his dad whos too cool to be
so he says why did you have me follow this stupid rule please
to be honest little fellow ill tell you
i was just as afraid as you
but you said you wanted to get with people and places ever new
and i got a bit scared of the fate of my baby sons future
so i invented a reason to see if you could ever make do
as soon as you appeared behind that rock looking angry at me
i soon realised what a hell of a man youve ended up being
i knew youd worked out how to swim which i hadnt had in me
and i stand as a companion of you proudest a man has ever been

turn your life on the flip of this coin
turn upside a choice youd normally avoid
and promise me youll follow what it says
whatever it saysim really okay thanks theres nothing to witness
i said as i looked back from the edge of the cliff
the old man looking down lent over the ridge
struck with a grin as if a blessing had hit him

i slumped on the jut of the cliff
just leave me alone this is none of your business
i will said the old man but just one thing
and what he said was so lovely it stunned me

he said i lay right there once at the edge of the rock
i was ready to jump i was ever so lost
but this gentleman stopped and said something i never forgot

for billions of years since the outset of time
every single one of your ancestors survived
every single person on your mum and dads side
successfully looked after and passed on to you life
what are the chances of that like
it comes to me once in a while
and everywhere i tell folk it gets the best smile

and then the old man walked away and out of sight
till the sound of him hiking turned to the sound of silence
i just froze in a profound surprise
and from down on my pride i found a smile to my eyes

and for many days again ive been passing the same cliff
and on many occasions id chance on the same thing
laying in the moss in the same way i was
would be another man looking like he needed a change of luck

so id say i lay right there once at the edge of the rock
i was ready to jump i was ever so lost
but this gentleman stopped and said something i never forgot

for billions of years since the outset of time
every single one of your ancestors survived
every single person on your mum and dads side
successfully looked after and passed on to you life
what are the chances of that like
it comes to me once in a while
and everywhere i tell folk it gets the best smile

for billions of years since the outset of time
every single one of your ancestors survived
every single person on your mum and dads side
successfully looked after and passed on to you life
what are the chances of that like
it comes to me once in a while
and everywhere i tell folk it gets the best smileill never give in till youre laying with me
you may as well tell me when that day will be
ill never give in till youre laying with me
you may as well tell me when that day will be

i dont mean to sound so keen but you know me and i dont feel
to spoil what weve got enjoying watching dots drawing out lines fully boring good time
through the scent of flowers and the humility of love the evening is now set up for a thorough dreamin of
the gentle guests and games with a sense of sex and said every sentiment lending metaphors for bed

ill never give in till youre laying with me
you may as well tell me when that day will be
ill never give in till youre laying with me
you may as well tell me when that day will be

ill soon lie to you tonight
about the true size of you in my mind
ill keep my arms with me for wrapping right round you
til what we spark of a thought that could drown you
does she do or does she dont love me true or fucking wont
the only time i know of love is when silence is violent
optimism fizzing in the clonk in dizzy image really rocking hot humidity but this is sizzling
stumble over innuendo does she notice does she fuck know starting the evening riffling through feelings

ill never give in till youre laying with me
you may as well tell me when that day will be
ill never give in till youre laying with me
you may as well tell me when that day will be

i dont mean to sound so keen but you know me and i dont feel
to spoil what weve got enjoying watching dots touring out lines fully boring good time

ill never give in till youre laying with me
you may as well tell me when that day will be
ill never give in till youre laying with me
you may as well tell me when that day will be

ill never give in till youre laying with me
you may as well tell me when that day will be
ill never give in till youre laying with me
you may as well tell me when that day will be

ill never give in till youre laying with me
you may as well tell me when that day will be
ill never give in till youre laying with me
you may as well tell me when that day will betill the very end
well be just as friends
ive know you better
youve seen my worst
so lets invent words


when a good night flounders
and its over
how good it was
i tend to know
by adding up
or rounding down
the evenings count of jokes

me and my ilk
share a twang thats indeciphered
by other gangs
thats a thing i love about my 
fine brothers in slang

if its got a funny story 
its made for me
its not for others in ear spalsh
its ours its mad its many hours
spent laughing at events passed
we smirk at how smart 
the work that we spark
a word which people laugh at
it sparks around the crowd
this work of art 
which we have found

till the very end
well be just as friends
ive known you better
youve seen my worst
so lets invent words

i love the craze
of the latest phrase
amazing mongrels of conjoinment
crazy paving sayings
are a joy to say with mates
and girls all love the lingo
they curl right up and bingo 
they go that extra smile
they go the whole damn snog

i mean it though
the joke from that one night
that was wrong
that makes no sense really
shorten to a word
then to a nod
that is friendship to me

the secret handshake of three mad mates
that makes me pleased to share traits
in understanding absurdities
that mean our brains play

till the very end
well be just as friends
ive known you better
youve seen my worst
so lets invent wordssome people live their lives by a little red book
the points for right lying out and guides them good
they never really mimic every word by eye
cuz if they did theyd be in a whole world of strife
the books quite old school but then it was tough
it contains some quite experimental justice
the thinking people are thinking that without this book
that without these verses wed pillage and murder but
following this red book word for word
leads you to actually pillage and murder
could it be so what we think to be right
is simply the opinion that survived

do what you thinks right and you will feel alright
cuz when youre bad you will feel sad
thats the religion i live by

theres a bloke in the book who made everything
he knows every individual and every trick in them
way above emotion never getting stressed
but when men choose against him gets jealous
people fight for him in crippling wars
but since he has the power of infinite awe
were merely itching on futilities floor
should we really be needing to assist him at all
if he loves us all knowing all we think
should he only like people with faith in him
given i cant control what i truly believe
can i be forgiven for only believing who i see

do what you thinks right and you will feel alright
cuz when youre bad you will feel sad
thats the religion i live by
do what you thinks right and you will feel alright
cuz when youre bad you will feel sad
thats the religion i live by

could it be time to avoid this bush
so we wouldnt be blind when joining up coulds
could we see both sides of the coin for the good
breed less strife on our voyage for good
getting threatened by men with questions
well never get anywhere rejecting evidence
could we test everything instead of betting
on alleged legends
if we teach that its right to blindly believe
if we reach to the sky to define our meaning
well i agree whats right will keep driving people to fight with people

do what you thinks right and you will feel alright
cuz when youre bad you will feel sad
thats the religion i live byone of the first things about you i did see
is that you verse your views quietly
when nature verse truths i get violent feelings
but softly time will reply thats wise

a delicate gesture of why you see
the best route through is being right through here
but met with a cute belying snide of fear
were best to go there along their idea

refrain x2
but you gently take things slowly
you softly bowl them over
thats the delicate way youve shown me
youre the strongest person i know

after taking the worst route blatantly
bang on cue we manage losing way
but in a squirmy back construed up way
they actually manage passing you the blame

with that man man im wrapped with rage
even then your temper stays exactly the same
and in that manner is the manner you stay
the beautiful person thats happily unchanged

refrain x2
but you gently take things slowly
you softly bowl them over
thats the delicate way youve shown me
youre the strongest person i know

in the heat of speech your words improve
right out of reach in my stirred up words
but every time they fuckin blurt out drool
im noticing their all learning from you

cause even though they know they cursed you
they shouldve admitted that they were fools
the next time theyre wanting to work things through
the very first person they turn to is you

refrain x2
but you gently take things slowly
you softly bowl them over
thats the delicate way youve shown me
youre the strongest person i knowall these walls were never really there
nor the ceiling or the chair
im eking weeks of peace on a beach
i see the breezes weave the trees
these walls youll find are yours and mine
defined not by them i
im in times that lie behind my eyelids
the sunset still the rising silence

ill not feel no fear
cos im not really here
im nowhere near here

theres no rain on roof that grates and beats me
my favourite tree breaking light to pieces
sprinkling sharded light on me
throw a stone as high as you can
and hearing with hand not hear it land
nothing taxing dusting sand
my window world spins and twirls
the walls then fall i recall the sort
white clouds white wash faded spotless
the weighty shadows ranges of rocks
the cold is all illusion thought up
stroll on the shore snooze and explore
all possibilities in each new morning
til satisfied reaching out yawning
fish in a big dish some rice and spice
salt over shoulder never salted so tight
the truth i have told was silence sometimes
but whos soul does not hide any crimes
wrapped in walls encircled by work
the walls fall - the story occurs
no barrier no boundary or low us ids tick tick tick tick
the freedom to stay or stray
be fiend or friend cause no harm but charm - the peaceful end

ill not feel no fear
cos im not really here
im nowhere near here
ill not feel no fear
cos im not really here
im nowhere near here

pale ancient woods strew white sandy bays
this ugly room pales away today
im swimming in the ocean
i sink slow motion
fingers toes floating
every year til yesterday
has seen the eternal setting sea
i compare all this to me;
little fleeting momentary me
i blink my eyes this is reminding me
life lies in the blink of an eye
the old die for reasons
new tides four seasons
new life born is like sneezing
all these walls were really never there
nor the ceiling or the chair
im eking weeks of peace on a beach
i see the breezes weave the trees
im not here at all
youre dearly fooled
i see bristling trees the shush of the sea
mischievous fluttering seagulls
no - im not trapped in a box
im glancing at rocks
im dancing off docks
since this dance began
thats where i am

ill not feel no fear
cos im not really here
im nowhere near here
ill not feel no fear
cos im not really here
im nowhere near here

so doneturn on the light
so it burns in the night
turning down the flay
the world is uncertain
im certained by the curtains tonight
you will not know but grow
we will not dare well always care and ply with your hair

got to reverse the pattern
whats the worse that could happen
for the first time in my adulthood
the worse that could happen
is utterly unthinkable sinking unsaid dread
suddenly im worried about the bread under the bed
but then all sort of awful shit seem plausible indoors
proportions get walked in to the worse and for certain
youre growing thumbs
im growing numb
totting to your moms lips like it might be quite fun

a blip on a screen 
you dont know me
i think about you
and what youll grow to be

black and white blotches to watch and not get
and the flashes of sense along with your body and head
it is all as simple as you think when you were little
it is all as simple as me sinking a little drink
your growing nails mine are so nailed
im drinking your mothers wine for both of us today
you dont know choice but you know my voice
you should never have of chosen me i have love like a boy
the worlds so dark sometimes the noise of the cars
building a world up of toys and stars

a blip on a screen
you dont know me
i think about you
and what youll grow to be

youll dance on every song foot fall every little move
before you realize that every noise is not music
my dad raised these thoughts he pastes these boards
i never knew i just grew thats all you can do
but then growing to an adult is just learning the language
of explaining with words what you were as a baby
youll leisurely learn how to lie and pretend
to service your love and rely on your friends
this could be fraught but its all i got taught and
i dont wanna make it up as i go along with yours 

i fix and i plan
but this is just mad
i love you
youre only a 100 pixels on a scanyoure giving me david hassles
i just want a daniel beddett

theres a tear in my tea
i do fear what will be 
you talk like you walk with a dictionary
tell your friends this will never end
time is a dime we fucking well spend

your music is not better than it sounds

limited channels of primitive fannel
cookery souped-up doupery what
chances and lotteries thats not for me
luxury flattery what have we got
like brandy or whines
throttle me wattle me bottle me nine
if it looks like a duck
and it walks like a duck
and it talks like a duck
it needs more time to cook

youre singing a song which is limping along
youve not got the voice now get up and be strong

youre giving me david hassles
i just want a daniel beddett

diplomacy making no sound like we
and go to hell sound like peace
its a disarming charm
while your army is arming
i need a tool for the job
i may be a fool i dont dob
choking on smoke and strokin on tokes
like a full sugar allen you provoke
people who hear you sing say you dont
give me a set-list set it to a jist
the night is cold like is not liking
the night is as old as just being pissed
my problems are flown in daily
living my life holding sides
spliffin the finger indecisive
but now im not sure of why
when were angry we slander
we often will pander that slang can be bang on

you giving me david hassles
i just want a daniel beddett

im not really thinking this
i watch and listen into things
but once ive seen and i do know
thats my emotions at show
this is me the me i be
collective reactions seen by people

you giving me david hassles
i just want a daniel beddett

the mystique of what you seek can never exist
the gist is just this
i jest and i test your dress to suggest
you quest to be any but breasts in a vest
so cheek when you speak as if you were unique
it leaks from your beak like the beaded white streaks of weekend beak
i speak with a tweak
youre a beacon of weakness
if it looks like a duck and it walks like a duck 
and it talks like a duck
it needs more time to cookhes behind you
hes got swine flu
make a sacrifice for societies sake
no decapitate your mate

you started sneezing
i could see that you were freezing
in the heat of this really unbelievable evening
the streets were all empty but for overturned cars
bellowing smoke from the sparse roads clothed with scars
the brain dead in face masks wandered im stretched
sizzling bacon from beyond the farfetched
ive never hurt my friend till the very burning end
is what flirtingly i said to my best friends head

verse 2
the story then was told
it got gory it unfolded
broadcasters blasting out stories of the poorly
i dont advocate anarchy in any way
but i saw him scratch a rash
and i had to grab an axe
weve all known each other since the groans of our mothers
and throwing with our brothers little stones in the river
the fact that my man might not actually expire
caused me some ire while i hauled him on the fire

theres something that i need to share with you all
i cant go on lying im developing sores
im turning im burning up im turning back bro
ill hold them up while u turn and runa journey through time

unlock the living put the four digit pin
in your hand you hold the whole world and its dan
clutch the bare rubber that judders up late
you muster more bluster and thrust yourself upstairs
cling to your thinking glintzing for a ding
if you with it youre and it and if you binned it youd wither
without it no doubt shit
no ounce its a bitch
history equips us with the kitchen sink

how would i survive without my outside line to the doubting life in 
in the inside lining of my trousers tonight

communication with the new nation
the escalator moves endlessly friend and to every station
quiver it delivers you the river or give up
addicted to the little thing that rings
like a torch in the dark reading short remarks
scorching candescent thoughts from the heart
information advantage in the face of a rabbit
people read headsets frozen in headlamps

how would i survive without my outside line to the doubting life in 
in the inside lining of my trousers tonight

well if i could build a time machine i would fly to you
as 60 minutes an hour with flowers in kind pursuit
we cant change the past but we can ruin the present
by scratching on our heads and fretting on the future
a man takes on to men take lovers and lunatics
metal fronted fronts another way of doing it
glory paid to ashes comes too late my phone mate
the closing blows on stakes on an only frozen lake
a constant stream of words in a wanton teeming and turgid splurge
rechecking the stream of comment
many dreams from one end to the other end of nonsense

how would i survive without my outside line to the doubting life in 
in the inside lining of my trousers tonightnever dwell on fights with kids the fish is thought ill when it smells like it is
frosty wind on the way to the station footsteps and thoughts of a patient man breaking
we wait our way all our life in this world many many days overturned and unfurled
on a rainy day making pay can be painful afternoon is cold as eyes that dont light

infamy infamy theyve all got it infamy 
infamy infamy theyve all got it infamy
infamy infamy theyve all got it infamy

the cold and the little fingers burn with frostlost in the wintery yearning lust
when the mist is drifting and the earth is rock and the lips are cracking like this is hitting crocks 
fall to your knees and call to me head spinning and wacked like a spin ball bat thwack 
maybe came december may i press the send button and send all pretenders to the end with their glutton

infamy infamy theyve all got it infamy 
infamy infamy theyve all got it infamy
infamy infamy theyve all got it infamy

caravaggio on his last throne staggering through rome rolled up masterpieces bagged to go
absurd is the third learn the circle of fifths the roman cords in every certainty hit  
note to the elves note to self quotes that seek not to doath on the locality of hell
recycled melodies you might never remember free writing hell freeze to the evergreen heaven

infamy infamy theyve all got it infamy 
infamy infamy theyve all got it infamy
infamt infamy theyve all got it infamy

on a decaff coffee decafalon one like hunter s thompson on a day off on one
dont shoot guns in the garden i punch things pardon i run tings from barnett but the fun is in car sale 
aft daily half cup daily rarsclart baily funk with a large shot of baileys 
i dont like people they are sometimes evil with a birmingham firm grip im learning em shit 

infamy infamy theyve all got it infamy 
infamy infamy theyve all got it infamy
infamy infamy theyve all got it infamyintro i want to give you to mr michael he has some lyrics for you

a formula four attraction can be formed into a fraction
and e equals this mc square for being stupid and seeing cupid
but then that is just then the agony of ecstasy when
like a fever of a sort recovery and another fever leads to the other lesson of le feeling of a not so loving walk
but a good ol bout of night club shouts and finest tiling grout
kind of outlines an eery early sketchy theory clearly
how does one define the time when love becomes divine

the lovelight of my life is 82 percent water its a mystery being mortal
the lovelight of my life is 82 percent water its a mystery being mortal

as much water as i can drink i know is good but unfortunately its tastes of small interest sipped in a boring ritual
if i walk an hour to drink after walking countless minutes youd think its the same drink but my gosh this water tastes the silt 
can you be friends with sarah looking fair and in a bend cooking nice she has her eyes on you for see being a divorceebut if i walked a day to drink boy the mysticals change wind is totally off this day it isdrinking this amazing drink

the lovelight of my life is 82 percent water its a mystery being mortal
the lovelight of my life is 82 percent water its a mystery being mortal
the lovelight of my life oi is 82 percent water its a mystery being mortal
the lovelight of my life geezers 
oh yeah whats the tune called hehe&lt;wake up and smell the coffee 

stirring a word the conversation obsurd 
like the herbs of work their pattiences and concured 
wake up and smell the coffee 
light up and dwell the offerings 
drink with a thinking pinch 
sit with a kitchen sink 

the world is outside but inside warm 
inside informal outside stormy inside normal 

back to the time skip it on its bullocks 
rome to the oven turn it off its on 
skin a racket fag im gone 
what are we waiting for mate 
lets wait to the place 
cause its all a bit late 
and were all in a bit of a state 
weed makes me not want to be in new places fight it 
stare at the same tv watching the torrent like it 

the world is outside but inside warm 
inside informal outside stormy inside normal 

the fossil-ed remains of locked of ancient ways 
are buried or lost in every of my mates brains 
but i cant find it because they like blazing 
solving that problem brings priests and doctors and poets maybe

and hot overclocked brains 
im not over shocked blotto or of my rock place

but i like bedding

is the skyline sliced up into pieces and broken steel and mesh
or is the progress of process thats a natural people quest
metal and the workings dark and lurking in my mind
branded neon red and blue flashes
the view from the flats is nice
i see alice in wonderland
i see malice in sunderland
mouse to house i am this land
the were without its thumberland
smoke to a karma coma
jamaicans do yard and roamers
shake bacardis and coke and make me laugh and 
trust me

so much stuff and many people
the future is not evil
the future is not fish and its simple its efficient
now that things are costing nothing
is any of it good
come and love me read my nothings
blogging river floods
dead plant planted on the window ledge
shadows dance glint and blend
glance slow at the night outside
im god in the game
sound rumbles in 51 round some corner to fight with guns
play god in games but nothing in
trust me

dub step club sweat come get rubbed red
play the playlist
play the playlist
i see alice in wonderland
i see malice in sunderland
house to house i love this land
the were without its thumberland

do the wrong thing joke it right
span the longings and the fights
for all the oil and the toil
and the spoils of the royals
we are nothing if not nice
we are coughing if we are wise
roll me up like a leafy spliff
fuck that roll me up and
trust me

why is there so much noise
reading info buying toys
we all fear of company
but we are fierce anonymously
enter shit on the internet
clashing people chatting evil
but we are cheery social sorts
with the pleasing photo forward
pass the love around and back to me
walking down a madmans street
the music in my ears is fleeting
struggle to shuffle to the same beat
we are nothing if not nice
we have a pretty buttered knife
is the skyline sliced up into pieces and broken steel and strife
anything you tell me
yes yes i will believe
but again and i suspect
again and i will leave
slow burn a little heaven
roaming yearnings for devon
coburn 67
dont work for them
trust me

dub step earth run red club sweat
put up chests and freeze freeze
is the skyline sliced up into pieces and broken steel and mesh
or is the progress of process thats a natural people questits time to go low its time to go low
is this space where my heart has been
its time to go low its time to go low
is this space where my heart has been

dont give them what they think they want just give them what they need
i dont wanna want what i want but i know that your heart bleeds

its time to go low its time to go low
is this space where my heart has been

from my heart that is defective passed my bark that says im weak
i never parked on art for sex i parked with whats effected
part of that is what is gone before shards of my own law
shattered so they cant say i ever parked up for the score
i make music thats what ill do with it well hang together ruefully
but to a ruthless melody ill hang these boots on me
i ran with the best but panned on the test that is for yes
and when the lights go out we run the plight that were about
dont give them what they think they want just give them what they need
i dont wanna want what i want but i know that your heart bleeds
we all happen to hang our heads here i lost sight of that fact in fear

is this space where my heart has been

dont underestimate me friends we dont know whos ahead til the end
i might spend all day with it and then pan the night away and make
nil and none and nan so jill and john and jen can kill and con with ken
for their fill and fun with friends
for all your pills and pons and penny im still stunned but sunny
over the hill - honey anyway youve willed it one but when will it spill what we spon and span
i have skill with skunk and skanks
we still not act abend - dont underestimate me friend
didnt i make it easy didnt i make it free
loyality is free when all the people see the dream
ive started so i finished even if the start is the beginning
they arent in this they partied willing

its time to go low its time to go low
is this space where my heart has been
its time to go low its time to go low
is this space where my heart has been

dont give them what they think they want just give them what they need
i dont wanna want what i want but i know that your heart bleeds
take your flunky and dangle fake your funk and handle it
i make funk on any angle and get some kind of age old fangul
time put down can be irrelevant of gain
thats the element of pain - for the blessing of the game
i might spend all day praying - pannying every kind of way
tapping the pencil henceforth - forever in a day
and suffer for nothing - thats the glough - i fucking love it bruv
what goes in dont come out joke jump in a shout

its time to go low its time to go low
is this space where my heart has been
its time to go low its time to go low
is this space where my heart has been

you and me forever walking

its time to go low its time to go low
is this space where my heart has been
its time to go low its time to go low
is this space where my heart has beenthat girl on the floor said she came through the door make me want more

more than a kiss more than a hug more than a  teeny little bit head to weed clashpour sinner in and i know boys like girls like der de der de der der
but where there is more for the thrill of it its different

hmm is there something after death or when death comes is there nothing after the comfortable last breathlend ame a pad ill sell you a plan
my hideaway is a ride away on the end of the line on the train old people and trees rather than gold teeth and cold theives oh its a fucking shame
still rolling the fucking rain sold to the smock in the cane then sold tot he fucker on drugs with the sold sign on his brain
still stroll on a cut and run bowl int he cold on the strut of done told ya too many rappers in the buzz of your ears acting up like you acting on fears
practically gun shit after every last tearthis is the soul in the cold house with my spouseget mashed to mad bashey splash a bit about cos the fragrance is important
i say this to be sporting but i think it like i drink it its like walking what youre talkingyou sneak in when i am asleep too numb to be afraidtiptoes creep the first heartbeats i may never wake

one of those mornings when the cars colder than the street pour the kettles contents on the old windscreen grilling bacon on foil
you may as well fry it the good that its doing for you boyexhaust fumes and the frost look no different to your breathbut for the blueness and the thickness and a depth
the scraping goes through me vibrating my shoes but happy i am as i pause for the thought only two moments i was dreamingtoasty and slowly i showed up in realism
the day will be bright and the days less figting when the sun becomes uppermost skybound and light i meet with my love and we talk about presents and the present presented with bevvies and scent of the plesant
tapping technology and the lack of all knowledge i tap into age old romance novels

cold will blow through the doors but only make it to the unlucky first table cold will blow through the doors but i will not pause from the fable that im uttering baby cold will blow through the doors

you sneak in when i am asleep too numb to be afraid tiptoes creep the first heartbeat i may never wake yeah the more that i fight the more that i like i knowits not really here its all in my head and i know

blinking thoughts thinking how i felt for you shrinking like the stomach of a corpse but were alivejust stuck in a vibe that hides behind the mind of a negative forceof course im sure
as i go back for more sealed wityh a kiss while our lips talk drunk from liqeurwake up head sore back to where we were beforeblood splatted up the walls highs and lows turning myself into one of those social networking pros
not concerning my emotions aint hurting im cold numb as im waiting for this story to unfold like gum i pop non stop until the flavours all gone thinking like a mathemetician two minus oneadd suspicion then im gone
its like i like him thinking that im out doing something wrong im sorry baby im lazyi dont like working when a job underpays me then i open the door let the cold blow in i let the cold blow in  me and himand then im gone in the wind gone in the wind  gone in the wind

you sneak in when i am asleep too numb to be afraid tiptoes creep te first heartbeat i may never wake yeah the more that i fight is the more that i like and i know its not really here its all in my head and i knowbackseat barz

seek truth every day iv been chewing some state visittheres more power to some in the warm shower of summer
you feel it in the eveningeveryones has something to hide if they dont theres something wrong personal space and privacy are rights that we hold strong
so devestating was the day and many felt the shock of innocent mens reputations wrecked upon the rocks
when a fishy foreign website went and listed a lofty list of everybodys names and everywhere on the net they’d been
published far and wide to the publics alarm and fright everybodys private lives for everybodys prying eyes
late nights on sites of minds that yearn to learn complete histories of mischeifs and the time of each searched word

everyones has something to hide if they dont theres something wrong personal space and privacy are rights that we hold strong

my life was ruined and so were many others when that fishy foreign website posted my private life uncovered some people looked like fools others ostracised
some people lost their money others lost their wives but for the others compared to me their suffering was nothing weve all been made to pay by them dredging up the mud

everything was peaceful and people were forgetting til this act of evil outed me and exposed my deeds to them

everyones got something to hide if they dont theres something wrong personal space and privacy are rights that we hold strong

time to go now time to part with a prayer there is a space where my heart has been somewhere out therethey say i am a monster they say i should be dead my friends an dfamily will never speak to me again

everyones got something to hide if they dont theres something wrong personal space and privacy are rights that we hold strong

i feel bad for the man who had been serving time for what theyve billed as recent histories most heinous crime but privacy is privacy wether anyones or mine even if i did commit recent histories most heinous crimeits envy mike skinner

straight as the seagull flies paint your pallet blue and grey but rain has the habit of doing away with any delayin the stars we lie twinly eyes link the scene with smiles

im just minding my own as you do im just minding my own as you do i got a mind of my own so im just minding my own just minding my own as you do

i wont stop til liv got enough for thatthis is my takeover give me n inch i might take over go ask tinchy stryder for half of the names and the game stay over

stirring a word the conversation obsurd 
like the herbs of work their pattiences and concured 
wake up and smell the coffee 
light up and dwell the offerings 
drink with a thinking pinch 
sit with a kitchen sink 

the world is outside but inside warm 
inside informal outside stormy inside normal 

back to the time skip it on its bullocks 
rome to the oven turn it off its on 
skin a racket fag im gone 
what are we waiting for mate 
lets wait to the place 
cause its all a bit late 
and were all in a bit of a state 
weed makes me not want to be in new places fight it 
stare at the same tv watching the torrent like it 

the world is outside but inside warm 
inside informal outside stormy inside normal 

the fossil-ed remains of locked of ancient ways 
are buried or lost in every of my mates brains 
but i cant find it because they like blazing 
solving that problem brings priests and doctors and poets maybe

and hot overclocked brains 
im not over shocked blotto or of my rock place 
i got their at lunchtime 
i was still their at 8 
next they were turning chairs onto the table at my place 
psychedelic cycle get it 
ride all wet 
arrive a bit sketch 
but i like bedding

the joy of the fight is the fight and the boy
im making this up now finding a point
is he even comprende
 is the fun of the thing

i cant resist anything
for temptation
im finding myself

in here is only ordinary
is the hero among the ordinarily
you have nothing to lose but your chains
so we might
and yet might be
or a
do it
do it
at the end of the tunnel there is always light
it just might be a train
is it

if youre going through hell

keep goinggaze up to the skies
truth youve opened up my eyes

on the leg and a wing
well be winging it hard
on the wing of prayer
on the wing of a car
between radio stations and tuned in verses
are echoes of the creation of this universe
stars dont light up
stars reflect
i dont light up
we reflect
you then light up i deflect
just the racket of crickets 
and this packet of biscuits
some flat out big riffs
and a fat lemon bifter

on the roof of your car at the stars
x3
through to the star

gaze up to the skies
truth youve opened up my eyes

one day theyre gonna make electrical implants for the brain that
simulate raving sensations away
imagine the dilemma 
for the man and his penance
if he can get fucked 
without hanging his health up 
would this be illegal no no no
would the daily mail rail on it
is this evil to need to escape these cages

on the roof of your car at the stars
x3
through to the star

gaze up to the skies
truth youve opened up my eyes

pull out the glove box
blanket in the boot
yesterdays sweets are hankering for some fruit
in a rainproof jacket on the sunroof
sack it
i wish on a star
i wish for a bar with a cigar
start up the engine til the battery doesnt flatten
the music on the shuffle is becoming a patent
i dont know what that is 

on the roof of your car at the stars
x3
through to the star

like some ballardian nightmare from 1986 
let the satellite navigation system guide us to the styx
we ride on her direction through the night while up to tricks
so the authority like figures dont find us with ours spliffs

on the roof of your car at the stars
x3
through to the star
repeat

gaze up to the skies
truth youve opened up my eyeslove is the answer

im pretty good at puzzles but puzzled by people
and i dont trouble trouble and trouble dont trouble me
stare at the paper fold it in two
facing the walls are the soles of my shoes

sometimes you have to find out for yourself
sometimes you need to be told
sometimes you never find the answer

we never had a crossword crossed word
my words got lost and you never heard
im 2 too down youre one across the room
beginning with i and ending in u
beginning in my eye and ending as an x
leaves a bad taste in my mouth
to think of you again like the bad taste leaking from the ink in my pen
doodle at the side as i do to life
choosing to lose time instead of doing what i like
starts off black and white and lacking in life
until pen in blue lends it a hue

puzzled by people
loving isnt easy
you cant google the solutions to peoples feelings

sometimes you have to find out for yourself
sometimes you need to be told
sometimes you never find the answer

chewing on the pen
2 down again
not enough letters for the clue in my head
lost in thought never been there before
with the turn of a pun on the tip of my tongue
the freshest memory will fail to recall
as well as the messiest faded scrawl

love is the answer
repeat pre-chorus &amp; choruseverybody

i sleep with one eye open sometimes i might close them
but if immediate action is required im fucking loaded
i know my exit strategies and i never plan anything
so in fifteen minutes i can be absolutely anywhere
within radio contact for once im on point
and the contacts are noisy we go dark

cause life goes pretty slow
if you dont even show up for the show you might never know

ill go out without a blink out without a blink
ill go downtown without thinking and shout over a drink
ill go out without a blink out without a blink
ill go downtown without thinking and shout over a drink
all the people in the place
all the people in the place

any hesitation anything tying you to the bed where you sleep
youre dead on your feet
theres nothing on my person but money in a shirt
in case any unexpected fun shit should occur
where i have to think on my feet and plan it on my own
hand to hand solo or tab it back home

cause life goes pretty slow
if you dont even show up for the show you might never know

ill go out without a blink out without a blink
ill go downtown without thinking and shout over a drink
ill go out without a blink out without a blink
ill go downtown without thinking and shout over a drink
all the people in the place
all the people in the place

take time in any new environment to relax
but if fenced in advance the best defense is attack
piss-poor planning proceeds any corporate party
where you dont know youre out out til youre shouting
dont hang back like a bore bags packed by the door
rags in a black backpack and the dashed in passport

cause life goes pretty slow
if you dont even show up for the show you might never know

ill go out without a blink out without a blink
ill go downtown without thinking and shout over a drink
ill go out without a blink out without a blink
ill go downtown without thinking and shout over a drink
all the people in the place
all the people in the place

ill go out without a blink out without a blink
ill go downtown without thinking and shout over a drink
ill go out without a blink out without a blink
ill go downtown without thinking and shout over a drinkturn on the light
so it burns in the night
turning down the flay
the world is uncertain
im certained by the curtains tonight
you will not know but grow
we will not dare well always care and ply with your hair

got to reverse the pattern
whats the worse that could happen
for the first time in my adulthood
the worse that could happen
is utterly unthinkable sinking unsaid dread
suddenly im worried about the bread under the bed
but then all sort of awful shit seem plausible indoors
proportions get walked in to the worse and for certain
youre growing thumbs
im growing numb
totting to your moms lips like it might be quite fun

a blip on a screen 
you dont know me
i think about you
and what youll grow to be

black and white blotches to watch and not get
and the flashes of sense along with your body and head
it is all as simple as you think when you were little
it is all as simple as me sinking a little drink
your growing nails mine are so nailed
im drinking your mothers wine for both of us today
you dont know choice but you know my voice
you should never have of chosen me i have love like a boy
the worlds so dark sometimes the noise of the cars
building a world up of toys and stars

a blip on a screen
you dont know me
i think about you
and what youll grow to be

youll dance on every song foot fall every little move
before you realize that every noise is not music
my dad raised these thoughts he pastes these boards
i never knew i just grew thats all you can do
but then growing to an adult is just learning the language
of explaining with words what you were as a baby
youll leisurely learn how to lie and pretend
to service your love and rely on your friends
this could be fraught but its all i got taught and
i dont wanna make it up as i go along with yours 

i fix and i plan
but this is just mad
i love you
youre only a 100 pixels on a scantheres those that dont know
those that dont know that they dont know
theres those that dont know
those that dont know that they dont know

from the north to the south from the east and west
london town is busy at best
with the kicks to the chest and the dips and the crests
fall asleep
fall asleep past your stop creeping
past 11 o clock in the morning no dawns ever boring

sometimes i lie in the bath til its cold
nothing but a laugh to the front in the back of my soul
i wanna live forever give my best guess
cause thats the best youll get is a guess but no less

smoke in the chest hold it in til its in your skin
inhale this hardly smoke thats a hardy toke
flip flops and your shorts or the big dogs on the porch
til the night on the scorch i light like a torch

theres those that dont know
those that dont know that they dont know
theres those that dont know
two stoned
those that dont know that they dont know

hunky dory all evening at a 140bpm
til its done sort of in the am or youve done talkin or its mayhem
at the cornucopia doped up the local shops a mere toe-tap
vocal in focus on the buying your papers and fire drill
and the brightest shades of milk we look a mighty shady ilk

memories of a long lost eon
millions of stars out there which one might you be on
its like jupiters moon in this room get the heat on
i need a  stencil to follow my pencil pensive and sensing
smoke in your chest hold it in til its in your skin
inhale this hardly smoke thats a hardy toke

theres those that dont know
those that dont know that they dont know
theres those that dont know
those that dont know that they dont know

you know me i always detest the dawn
the grass always looks like it was left on the lawn
you talk around events and from side of your sight
the benson burns it reflects in your eyes

theres those that dont know
those that dont know that they dont know
theres those that dont know
those that dont know that they dont knowwe line the streets like soldiers daily
to let them know that we aint fading
this is a beat you can see it in my eyes
its gonna stay like this its gonna stay like this

we line the streets like soldiers daily
to let them know that we aint fading
this is a beat you can see it in my eyes
its gonna stay like this until they realize

eighty thousand people in a state of rowdy fever
there will never be a sequel to this evening
singing in the rafters in the wings and over galleys
and then after all the laughing just a draught

from the wings and over galleys til im in a lonely alley
if a feeling from my childhood comes to me then i will rally
with all the cloves and all the rose tinted rows that go and sully
soak up that moment woe is the finale

lonely i am sinking in and over thinking it
looking at the goal only slowly it is shrinking
hesitate hesitate hesitate wait
any day any day
too late

we line the streets like soldiers daily
to let them know that we aint fading
this is a beat you can see it in my eyes
its gonna stay like this its gonna stay like this

we line the streets like soldiers daily
to let them know that we aint fading
this is a beat you can see it in my eyes
its gonna stay like this until they realize

the cheapest throwaway shades are my deepest stowaway aid
im up with the angels but keep a toe in the trade
known these folks since i was little but only through this ritual
its a pity they dont know me but what is there else than this

sweeping and sweeping the speaking unceasing
from steeple to steeple the people are shrieking
soon we parade through the fence absolutely dame judy denchd
and then stop tell them to score and they flop

i dont think i like this im only ever nervous
im a fighter im a fighter but tonight id like to flight
hesitate hesitate hesitate wait
any day any day
too late

we line the streets like soldiers daily
to let them know that we aint fading
this is a beat you can see it in my eyes
its gonna stay like this its gonna stay like this

we line the streets like soldiers daily
to let them know that we aint fading
this is a beat you can see it in my eyes
its gonna stay like this until they realize

the past isnt over last minute grow
ask me to show you ask me to go
or stab me in the throat
hesitate hesitate hesitate wait
any day any day
too latesaying i love you forever wont hold us together
a dove and a feather wont better our love
or recover us ever
but i dont know if i missed you
or if im blowing this tissue because i only miss you
rather than no id not risk you
thats not a frown i like how is it now you decide
ill go to town if i like be round about 5
your future lies in you seeing new guys
youll feel new eyes on you youll need to lie about this
and me you like wise too

we can never be friends
one wants to stay together
one wants it to end
we can never be friends
we can make it easy

mistake a little wait for an ache
mistake loneliness to mean only us
an addiction to a fix of praise
rely on me to say its ok
there is only room for one in this sun
there was only one of me and you once
and you want to want another few loves
in the night let it fly to the light
all the bits you miss from your ex
commitment kissing and sex
are what youll insist from the next

are what youll insist from the next
but is it who dares wins or only who knows goes
frank brunos nose has seen too many blows
your bitter then its better to pretend not bicker
its butters when it festers it fucks all the fun
this is us fizzling
but with added little pangs
we reached the end youll never see me again

we can never be friends
one wants to stay together
one wants it to end
we can never be friends
we can make it easy

we can never be friends
one wants to stay together
one wants it to end
we can never be friends
we can make it easy

we can never be friends
one wants to stay together
one wants it to end
we can never be friends
we can make it easystop for a minute dont make a move

stop for a minutelooked at your status
in a relationship
in a relationship
an earthquake hit me oi

your status had changed
youve never worked about this
couldnt drag my eye away
the words on the screen
nothing set between us but you just werent that keen
in a relationship
plainheld bettyka

got to walk away and let it go
why did you leave it so late to tell me
wow a revelation oh oh
then i get you you get me honestly and
wow a situation
oh my gosh why did you leave it so late to tell me
wow a revelation
then i get you and you get me on the street and
wow a relation 

looked at your photo of folks i didnt know
folks i hadnt noticed seem close to you now
wed been hangin out a lot
id gathered that would have to stop

all that build up for me 
all the weeks of us walking past tree after tree
all the patience and doubt
the relational maybe
may as well bow youre in a relationship now

why did you leave it so late to tell me
wow a revelation oh oh
then i get you and you get me honestly 
and wow a situation

oh my gosh why did you leave it so late to tell me
wow a revelation uh oh
then i look at you and you look at me on the street and
wow a situation

looked at your status 
in a relationship
in a relationship
it devastated me
then what did i spy i punched the f***king sky 
among the normally ignorable requests at the right
id of never of guessed a request so nice
now if you look at my status
im in a relationship too with you

why did you leave it so late to tell me
wow a revelation oh oh
then i look at you and you look at me honestly and 
wow a situation

i stand corrected i was pushing for the best i guess
i took one look at you and i could fog out the rest
if ive got what it takes and it wont be wasted on fakes

i paced myself
i have faith this time
i saw something for me
i felt something right

why did you leave it so late to tell me
wow a revelation
then i look at you and you look at me honestly and
wow a situation

why did you leave it so late to tell me
wow a revelation
then i look at you and you look at me honestly and
wow a situationi used to love the night and now i dread my bed
using all the light is how my head got spent
torturous virus talk to my eyelids walk in my size nines
is this depression or a lesson from inner pressure pressing
either way the fevers it deals me are evil

the thing that i love most is trying to kill me

i have the queerest feeling of my dearest appearing
to be leering from the ether fear more fever
i dont like sleepers drugs make me sleep
sleep is like death to do death when youre dead

bridge disappears through fog in my ears
for this chronic fatigue theres no tonic is seems
lucid thinking is loopy to think of on and on weeks

the thing that i love most is trying to kill me

general health making my mental health break
but ill never let go of what helps me create
nothing to this point but for this love
love torturous virus get out from my eyelids

just wanna ride out life in the key of c
i wont bash the black notes i wont ask for answers
glance up at the banister

the thing that i love most is trying to kill me

the only good thing and i should cling to it good
are the sparks of good art that park in the darkness
shaking eyes hate me to write
but make me think up quite nice ideas

its like me enemy telling me forget the pen dwelling
the madness and sadness is long
but flashes of mastery

it seems

how many ways will it warm up 8 months ago fate came
to break me in somewhat and rape me on the flames
the queerest feeling of my dearest appearing
to be leering from the ether i fear more fever

like the bridge disappearing through fog in my ears
theres no tonic it seems for this chronic fatigue
im happily trading insanity lately
for passion that makes me a man at least maybe

the thing that i love most is trying to kill me
the thing that i love most is trying to kill me

what was i thinking who was i then
duly i tried truly amen
what was i thinking who was i then
duly i tried truly amen

pull some paper out the printer pick up a pen and pen into the winter
the oldest cell in my bodys only 10 years old
with the smell of the kitchen i dwell on the kissing of my missus
holding a bowl and reminiscing
i am just a child who got a few years older
pull some paper out the printer pick up a pen and pen into the wintertrust me
is the skyline sliced up into pieces and broken steel and mesh
or is the progress of process thats a natural people quest
metal and the workings dark and lurking in my mind
branded neon red and blue flashes
the view from the flats is nice
i see alice in wonderland
i see malice in sunderland
mouse to house i am this land
the were without its thumberland
smoke to a karma coma
jamaicans do yard and roamers
shake bacardis and coke and make me laugh and 
trust me

so much stuff and many people
the future is not evil
the future is not fish and its simple its efficient
now that things are costing nothing
is any of it good
come and love me read my nothings
blogging river floods
dead plant planted on the window ledge
shadows dance glint and blend
glance slow at the night outside
im god in the game
sound rumbles in 51 round some corner to fight with guns
play god in games but nothing in
trust me

dub step club sweat come get rubbed red
play the playlist
play the playlist
i see alice in wonderland
i see malice in sunderland
house to house i love this land
the were without its thumberland

do the wrong thing joke it right
span the longings and the fights
for all the oil and the toil
and the spoils of the royals
we are nothing if not nice
we are coughing if we are wise
roll me up like a leafy spliff
fuck that roll me up and
trust me

why is there so much noise
reading info buying toys
we all fear of company
but we are fierce anonymously
enter shit on the internet
clashing people chatting evil
but we are cheery social sorts
with the pleasing photo forward
pass the love around and back to me
walking down a madmans street
the music in my ears is fleeting
struggle to shuffle to the same beat
we are nothing if not nice
we have a pretty buttered knife
is the skyline sliced up into pieces and broken steel and strife
anything you tell me
yes yes i will believe
but again and i suspect
again and i will leave
slow burn a little heaven
roaming yearnings for devon
coburn 67
dont work for them
trust me

dub step earth run red club sweat
put up chests and freeze freeze
is the skyline sliced up into pieces and broken steel and mesh
or is the progress of process thats a natural people questi had a funny dream and i came to screaming
that i was in a funny house but it was kind of mine
and i was with you only it wasnt you
it happened in the past but it was somehow now

it put it into focus things became clear
i had to plan something i handed in my notice
even though to most it looked random
my heart had left i was just going in tandem

i smoked one too many cigarettes
i heard one too many lies
and ive gambled on too many bets
i lost it all too this life
im packing up my desk ive put it into boxes to this life
knock out the lights lock the locks and leave

ill leave one evening be seen off
at a party for my parting in a bar
it starts on the early side and ends in a gutter
with a fumble with a colleague in a car

no more alarm that barks in the dark
with the beeping like darts to the heart
yes the maze it does look deep
and days are over for dozing on my cheek

i smoked one too many cigarettes
i heard one too many lies
and ive gambled on too many bets
i lost it all too this life
im packing up my desk ive put it into boxes to this life
knock out the lights lock the locks and leave

read the funny card signed by all
that was purchased by the person i will always recall
lock away my labors steel stationary
a kiss on the lips or a grin in a grip

i had a funny dream and i came to screaming
that i was in a funny house but it was kind of mine
and i was with you only it wasnt you
it happened in the past but it was somehow now

i came to it noon through the tune of a spoon
in a mug in a room but i knew very soon
that the mug in the room was the mug yours truly
because i never stood up for what i wanted to do

i smoked one too many cigarettes
i heard one too many lies
and ive gambled on too many bets
i lost it all too this life
im packing up my desk ive put it into boxes to this life
knock out the lights lock the locks and leave

i smoked one too many cigarettes
i heard one too many lies
and ive gambled on too many bets
i lost it all too this
i smoked one too many cigarettes
i heard one too many lies
and ive gambled on too many bets
i lost it all too this life
im packing up my desk ive put it into boxes to this life
knock out the lights lock the locks and leave to this life
