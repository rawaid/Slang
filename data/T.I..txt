im like a pez dispenser shawty i spit treats
the nigga who even sound good on a bullshit beat

[hook 2x]

well pussy nigga you can like it you can love it
you can bite it you can dub it
but you cant do it how we does it
when we ballin in public
where the grill full of gold or seville full of hoes
wood wheels and some voes or huned gold spokes
i park at the club and a huned hoes choke
spark up some dubs let them huned hoes blow
i run game to get the hoe once they act like i cant run it no mo
i stunt them hoes broke and her money po po
you cant smoke the way we smoke if you aint smokin no dro
drink the way we drink wit no hen and no mo
you cant ride the way we ride if you aint slammin benz dos
cant ball wit me if you got eight but can only spend fo
you aint vip like me and cant be searching your coat
aint no pi like me if you aint workin no hoes
cant do the shit we do the way we do wit no dough
thats like trying to win a ballgame if you aint takin no score

[hook 4x][verse 1 - ti]
they say love blind so why cant i picture this guhl mine
yea i dig her but i figure im wastin this guhl time
im runnin from relationshipz scared to commit
mad at monogamy sexually im a misfit
but this shits way too much fo me
usually i can takeem and makeem a cut buddy
yo mama probably see me and say that im no good
i was born in the burbs i was raised in the hood
we from two seperate sides of life two different backgrounds
shawty been legit and i just started to rap now
i aint tryina act now im bein real witchu
really i just wanted to kick it and chill witchu
but the picture got bigger fo i could even paint it
thoughts got deeper befo a nigga could think
a playa like me on this strange aint it
one thang bout yo feelins is this you cant change it
yo preception on me i dont think i can maintain
we flirtin with disaster this game we playin iz dangerous
you the best thang that happened since i don became famous
but sometimes i think we shoulda remained strangers

[chorus - jazze pha]
i i chose you baby
stay with me now stay with me sing it fo me shawty
i i i i i chose you baby
ah come on uh uh uh cmon

[verse 2 - ti]
i like you to persue but still i respect it to let it go
give it time give it room to breathe and let it grow
ill just tell her when im ready to change ill let her know
hate to say it but til then be friendz and nuthin mo
evendoe anotha time anotha life anotha place
i swear i know we coulda been great
but rather than great you lil heart take the smile of yo face
so i can treat you righ im willin ta wait
and aint shit fake i know it sound funny comin from a felon
but i think i got a piece of whuz up in heaven
so to keep from blockin mah blessings think i better back up
last thang a nigga need now is bad luck

im this far from being a star and just that close to quittin
i never should of came close to missing
but i want to be a musician pimpin not a politician listen feel my position this a rough transition
plus im way to deep in the game to be trying to change
from fortune and fame and glamour i could be in the slammer
or six feet under atlanta its a blessing to breath i walk the streets with seven felonies im blessed to be free
long as somebody up in heaven who keep blessing the g tip is still be blessing cds so haters you can see these
cause im back now with something to prove everything to gain pimpin nothing to lose
i oughta start smackin niggas when theres nothing to do
they to big shoot em in the leg and even the odds cause you aint hard
less you round with captain c rod trap with kt and brawl with jr
fuck hoes with dp broke bread with jg 
switch labels like kp poofa did all that to me even
though id rather go back to slangin drugs an shit
this a gang of niggas and bitches really love this shit

[chorus]
i cant quit
even though polices hate on legit
and rappers hate it cause they know im the shit
hell naw i cant quit
some niggas hatin on the money im getting
most of them hatin cause im fuckin they bitch

some niggas hatin on the rocks and the rings 
some of them hate cause they dont think im the king

still in the traps signing your shirts given you doubt
kikin it with ya then get yo and your folk into the club
holes of the pictures where girls gave kisses and hugs 
hold and i look at the show passing niggas the drove
one of the realist rappers niggas will know
but niggas be hatin to the point where they be calling the station
but they respect it cause im ready and focused 
then i see they panties an vocals i want you to know
this the closest you know this
niggas in the game aint real got to stay sellin records cause the fame aint shit
and fuck the units that they name will sell 
theyll break your hearts and see your favorite rappers lame as hell

[chorus]

[ti]
some of the people some of time times 
some of you rhyme but might not like one of them lines
i tell you i let you criticize me one of them times
those of you that think im to cocky get in front of the line
whether you dont like my ego or my arrogant flow
dont like it when you say im tyte
i say i already know
dont like how i was talkin shit before my album blowed
think i need to calm it down become more like the average joe
so fuck yo little thoughts and that little house you think im in
get a benz i value your opinion then think i give a fuck how many times my record spins
well what you recommend im back again 

[chorus][intro]

time rhyme bout the times i invested in caine
pleasure and pain in every aspect of the game

mindframe they accomplishments are nothin to gain
eventually see im outta yo range
except this rose gold glow from my wrist and my chain
i entertain young niggaz who slang
like a picture no frame see its simple and plain
my shit bang spit flames put niggaz to shame
flow so insane lyrics stick in yo brain
now you cant mention my city unless you mention my name
t-i-p-i-m-p im the man

[chorus]
ay be easy - you dont want no trouble with me
just be easy - the drama aint nothin to me
ay be easy - before you have problems just breathe
ay be easy - you aint worth dyin believe me
just be easy - you dont want yo mama to grieve
be easy - well mind yo bizness dont bother the g
be easy - swear you stuntin but you frontin to me
be easy - behind the scenes or behind yo 
ay be easy

[verse 2]
steadily kissin ass when i came to leave
set the standard for atlanta rearranged the lead
okay so what tha fuck is fame to me
i been plottin since kindergarten youz a lame to me
i give the niggaz what they came to see
a reflection of one self where they aim to be
as you can see it aint no change in me
and you wont meet another nigga off the chain as me
im so fly no lie dont deny it ya feel it
so inspired by my style decided to try it yoself
bet you wont meet nobody ranked as high as myself
the checks you waitin on homes i can sign them myself
tote gats dro smoked that now im high
seats way back in the maybach i ride
through the streets of the westside i slap five
and throw dubs show love nigga hate me nah

im either running for my life or im just waiting to die
im the supplier of the fire if youre chasing a high
its never when or why its the way that he die
did he stand like a man till the day that he die
or was he reaching for guns or trying to run
or was he outside on the lawn in front of his son
and if ya running your mouth you can die in the slum
cuz in the south where im from they dying for crumbs
you can die for your patnas or die for ya moms
or you could die cuz your nigga just heard the alarm just stealing
or die in a plane they say its a bomb
when they run it into a tower they just say its saddam
screaming allah the moment that its hitting the building
with total disregard for all men women and children
see niggaz get killed when people mix they money with feelings
im filling my money up in the wall some in the ceiling
im just one of the millions of niggaz who 
its a war going on and they killing for nothing
we were in denial all awhile they where flicking the buttons
id rather be dying for something instead of living for nothing
end of discussion

[chorus]
hey aint no more talk
just start killing niggaz off till aint no more chalk
or no mo tape to outline no mo scenes
or no mo crimes no mo dying for no mo phenes
or no mo rims and things and no mo green
and no mo chains and rings that go bling bling
and no mo passionate rapping and so it seems
its just these talent less rappers they all acting
and i know so aint no mo talk
just start killing niggaz off till aint no mo chalk
or no mo tape to outline no mo scenes
or no mo crimes no mo dying for no mo phenes
or no mo rims and things and no mo green
and no mo chains and rings that go bling bling
and no mo passionate rapping and so it seems
its just these talent less rappers they all acting
and i know

[verse 2]
yeah they said it wasnt no mo green for no mo grind
no mo room for no mo kings and no more crown to be given but by no means
am i any more conceited than this game needed
and if i say it believe it im running the region you see it
popping and blowing im stopping im going
im just telling you knowing you sleeping or hating
and i dont care what you niggaz is thinking or saying
about you know who the one who say you know what do you know where
but you the best cuz you goin care
now i aint think so either but we know greedll make ya
do strange thangs if we aint people
and if ya busting bout nothing than we aint equal
you just cussing for nothing and poisoning people
and its embarrassing laughing at all of your songs
and you can hate me right now but youll miss me fore long when im gone

[chorus][ti - talking]
ay im working here know what im saying
try to put yourself in my shoes for a second
its not personal im just sayin though

[verse 1]
ay look
from when the moon came out till the sun came up
i was supplyin the days with what they flame up
our mamas passing by trying to explain us
pissing in the bushes like they never house trained us
but try to understand thats how we came up
you get to know us youll love us but you cant change us naw
really we rather be rich and famous
but in the mean time were forced to slang dust
dro or crack cocaine penicillin to rogaine
ecstacy viagra whateverll get the dough mayne
im tired of people mis-representing my dough mayne
oh you think we out here killing for nothing hustling
for no gains picture that

[hook sample playing in the background]
hey man im just doing my job
hey lady dont mind me im just doing my job
i dont wanna make your life more harder im just doin my job
you live here i work here im doing my job

[verse 2]
i dont know if you dont know dont care or cant see
every time something up in the hood it aint me
and i aint always up to no good and on the creep
and ye aint always gotta pass through the hood without speaking how you doing
we aint out here threatining your lives raping your children
we just out here staying alive making a lil bit you know
working hard trying to survive chasing a billion
you hear us talking loud just think of us as chamelions
adaptin to situations but accusations is still there
and robbing your house now you just hurting my feelings maaan
we got lives we wanna live nice too
we got moms dads wives kids just like you
but our options are fewer its hell in high school
when your helping with the rent lights and the gas bill too
so before you go judging us loving us wont hurt
if youre under 25 staying alive is hard work

[hook]

[verse 3]
and for you to see what im saying open eyes would help
if you could think about somebody besides yourself
why you pointing fingers at me analyze yourself
quit all that chastising and try to provide some help
instead of calling the law and busting my balls
with all due respect we dont even be fucking with yall maan
and we cant help it cause it is like this
we dont like it no more than you that we live like this
always stuck in the grind from summertime to wintertime
cut school and sell fifty dimes by dinner time
see everything we know we learned from the streets
since thirteen ive been hustling and earning my keep

you tried to make it up but shit you couldnt pay enough

but it wasnt though and you wasnt there
thats all i knew so i grew up thinkin you aint care
i know it wasnt fair but ay it wasnt fun
but now whats done is done no matter wha im still yo son
i could care less if none of yo other children come
ima be right there prayin you live to be a million one

and i cant find the words nor the nouns or verbs
to express whachu deserve girl you worth the world
but im a man and i aint perfect if you hear me now
ill tell you wha had happened when why where and how
me and yo mama met we kinda kicked it off
but we wasnt posed to have a baby we just chillin out
we had a lot in common almost the same signs
same goals said thangs at the same time
but then we destroyed the situation like the a changed mind
how could i look her in her eyes and holla dat aint mine
her stomach gettin bigger and time is gettin close
six seven eight nine months and i aint told mah folks

give us this day our daily bread
and forgive us for our trespasses
as we forgive those who trespass against us
lead us not into temptation
but deliver us from evil
for thine is the kingdom the power and the glory
for ever and ever

verse 1
man im prayin for help
while im lookin at the life i left
its kinda hard not to hate myself
but quiet is kept right or wrong
its just the way i felt
i might be better of prayin for death
on my knees i knelt
still trying to find a way to accept
it aint a way i can help nobody
till i save myself
technically im still a slave myself
i gotta climb out the grave myself
man i played myself
but when i look at all the fans i touched
i ask how can a man thats done so much
be treated so unjust
cause im tryin to inspire da folks
wanna condemn cause they sell dope
well man show em the ropes
be a father a football coach a role model or a symbol of hope
take another approach
instead of testifying against em in court
handcuffin em and closin the door so they can be worse than before
cant you see they only do what they know
then you wonder why they dont care no more
life aint fair i know
but why im hated everywhere i go
next time you wanna compare my flow just know
im prayin for help…

chorus
askin somebody else to give me a hand
im tryin hard but im only a man man
im prayin for help
hopin somebody else can see what i see
its like the hood only matter to me they got me
prayin for help
hopin somebody else can carry the torch
im all alone with no kinda support
while i was prayin for help
realized i dont need nobody else
if god with me i can do it myself
tired of just prayin for help

verse 2
i know its only one king
one thing one being only something i believe
without seein and with all my faith
i pray somehow someway regardless of what anyone say
i believe one day that imma change my life
get right start livin like christ till the end of my fight
imma be defending my strife till somebody come and shut off my lights
i aint never gone quit
no matter how difficult is gone get
and you can bet whatever on this
im forever gone spit
harder than niggaz hatin on tip
you can take the weight and place it on tip
ill double my load carry it as the trouble unfolds
hold yos and i bet i dont fold

if it takez till im 100 years old
bet im reachin every one of my goals
you know im prayin for help…

verse 3
so many times i done wish that i could change my mind
change my life and leave the game behind
and its been so many days
i done prayed i could find a way
find the heart and the time to say
only so many are blessed with
so many chances so many checks
so many fans with so many arrests
and its been so many deaths
so many prisons with niggaz in there
and the system keep playin them to the left
man its so many test so many haters love seein you stress
but tribulations come with being the best
still theres so many reflects singin bout tecs
winnin green and the trickz
sellin dreams that never seen in the jex
thats why im seen as a threat
so many stripes off the streets in my vest
so many rappers get so little respect
man niggaz faith on the shelf
cause of the cards that a nigga was dealt
or the hard that a nigga done dealt
so many niggaz that left
out of the hood
made a way for theyself
instead of givin back they stay for theyself
so many playin theyself
instead of reading educating theyselves
the ones who wont pray for theyself they got me
prayin for help…

chorus
askin somebody else to give me a hand
im tryin hard but im only a man man
im prayin for help
hopin somebody else can see what i see

oh lame ass nigga why you mad at me
sucka ass nigga why you mad at me

[verse 1]
remember late nights earn stripes servin straight white
talk shit slap box clear into the day light
might fuss may fight but stay tight
keep what the j need for the lighter hit the base pipe
if the trap was the ocean or the sea
you could consider me and them the killa whales and great whites
befo a nigga tried to click it make them think twice
cause they knew cap would kill a nigga fo blink twice
day right im recitein my life
nigga i was there no matter what through sirens on a silent night
cold sundays slow mondays hot friday nights
tuesday thursdays servin whether or not they ride tonight
on peaceful days hostful evenings even violent nights
chip on my sholder hold a grudge cause you can die tonight
i swear you niggaz had no idea what my life was like
befo the bright lights and a half a mil just to grab the mic

[chorus]
is it cause i came from the bottom to the top
why you mad at me
maybe cause i spent a hundred on a drop
why you mad at me
is it cause i kept it pimpin and stayed down
why you mad at me
or is it cause i am the a town
why you mad at me
is cause you a lame and im a g
why you mad at me

why you mad at me
is cause you know yo time runnin out

[verse 2]

they keep talking about you
because they - cant keep up with your pace
youre my - super freak super freak

[verse - ti]
my momma taught me everything fine aint the finest
and everything that shine aint a diamond
they say that change come wit time and im finding
that most bitches take your kindness for blindness
yeah it feel good laying her beside you
diggin deep ol nine up beside you
but we cant kick out in public gotta hide you
cause all my partnaz in the hood done tried you
its true that you cant turn a hoe into a house wife
well listen shorty maybe i dont want a house wife
they say that you a freak im thinking that they bout right
because that pussys so good and your mouth tight
a pretty face slim waist and her stout nice
juicy ass that them niggaz in the south like
she super sexy got a nigga thinking bout a wife
wearing all white being wit her for life

[chorus]

[verse - ti]
the main thing making niggaz judge you
is the same thing that make me wanna love you
from the smell of ya hair i wanna hug you
to the way you yell give it to me when i fuck you
plus you aint tripping off a nigga cause he thuggin
thats why im twice as happy as relationships that wasnt
but my partna say you trickin wit his cousin
but nevermind i dont listen they be buggin
they find it hard to understand how could tip love
this girl when her man is out at strip clubs
maybe cause tip girls leaving wit girls
and in the morning theyll be waking up with six girls
they dont know we more like homies when we pick girls
why you worried bout it he aint gotta make you his girl
fuck what he think about you i think you the shit girl
make me wanna bring another kid in the world

[chorus]

[verse - ti]
now i been told every nigga in the streets know
she aint nothing but a freak ho
but when i look in her pretty eyes i dont see it though
now she done showed me some shit that i aint seen before
but what we do behind closed doors is for me to know
all in all ive decided im a keep her though
im a fucking grown man what im creeping for
just try me by the four thats what im toting heaters for
id die by that for her a real good reason though
thats how i feel let my partnaz and my momma know
keep it real all the disrespect has got to go
i disrespect she is selfish she dont hide it
though she may have been a tad misguided
all she need is a little affection a lot of direction
a nigga wit a constant erection
and i done wasted plenty time contemplating second guessing
procrastinating i wanna buy a ring and pop the question

put up the house and bet the odds if its coming from me
ogs say i need to learn to be patient
you tellin me with these seven years of probation
pistol charges and a host of other open cases

got four kids the smiles on they faces

[ti]
i was born into poverty raised in the sewerage
streets always would be a part of me it made me the truest
and even when my days were the bluest
i never ran from adversity instead i ran to it
fear aint in the heart of me i learned just do it
you get courage in your fears right after you go through it
now i come through in a coupe on 22s
that aint bad for a nigga who aint even finish school
dont get me wrong i never been a fool
i just put off graduatin for a pair of tennis shoes
i used to use the beat to paint my pain
but nowadays man i cant complain
i got several automobiles &amp; they all on thangs
several size of tangent and they all in one ciain
used to see me in the mall im the same
and gettin brain from a couple broads on the plane

[chorus]

[common]
i come from chi-town lost and found in the struggle
where dudes say stay safe and stay out of trouble
speak is muffed the law and b gon try to cuff you
those with duffles move weight and have muscles
i came through the dirt with a verse for the people
open up for daddy kane and eazy up at the regal
the radio rarely put their needle on my record
they aint see how the hood and heaven were connected
sounds projected aint show how effective
lessons learned sessions turned to life reflected
and everything i found real in life know i kept it
they say lifes a teacher youre gonna get tested
when a nigga changed they keep saying that nigga strange
couldnt see how my mind wont be the lame
ahead of my time i caught up with the game
making good music making paper making change

[chorus]

[ti]
i put on gasoline drawers i stood in the fire
with enough heat to set the hood on fire
man you niggaz think suge was off the wire
you shouldve seen the squad before i had messiah
we assumed the title as the number one supplier
felt like i was selling blow since i was in diapers
and wish a nigga would come try us
we was cool with the killers best friends with the lifers
quick to up and scrap with niggaz who want to deny
for what we considered then as a lucrative empire
but like that pimping time flash by you
now i wonder what the judge think as he reading my priors
prison aint full and the reefer aint bias
you aint got to tell and distant the liars
gave the jail hell and shot birds at the hearse
lived through worse and reversed the curse

[chorus][governor]
hello [x9]

[ti - verse 1]
hey whats happenin
its been a minute huh im just hollerin
how you doin 

its been a minute since i seen ya
i fell off for the scene 
cuz it seem like you wanted other things than da king
why you fightin fussin cussin and disagreein wit da king
when you got cribs cars bling and a king wit da king
is the grass as green as it seemed in ya dreams
are you gettin all the things that you needed and i aint bring
does it satisfy your self-esteem bein seen on da screen
is this new nigga the real thing or is just a lil fling
did he buy a nice bracelet and get ya a lil ring
or give you all the attention and the lil things
he know what to do with the stuff you stuff in them lil jeans
do he stand up and lean in it til you start screamin 
or smack your ass and kiss your g-string to start eatin muah
you get how you need it not only when its convenient
i just pick up the phone and call you every week or two to let you know i miss you
to see how that other nigga treatin you

[hook - governor]
i remember morning noon and night 
i used to hold you tight
i know we used to fuss and fight 
but im just calling to say hello hello hello oh baby
see time has a funny way of keeping us close 
even though we never stayed toghether
i just wanted to say hello hello hello

[ti - verse 2]
hello

hey whats happenin how ya doin
i know plenty of niggas pursuin them panties all for the screwin
fly you down to miami
let you walk the red carpet wit a  at da grammys
but im what he can never be a boss understand me
he pose and take  things he buy for ya
he got you a rose but that dont mean hed die for ya 
hey maybe i got too much pride to cry for ya
but not too much to call you and tell you that i adore ya
and tell you how im missin you lovin you and kissin you
and think about the good old days and wanna visit you
this song id like to listen to whenever reminisicin you

and my pops had alot of work alot of folk he got em work
and ran numbers said if he aint wanna he aint gotta work

ran through atlanta with heat when even atlanta was sleep
nigga back before you heard of me
i was middle man into servin keys when kc was serving 3
im on top because i deserved to be
so simmer down calm your nerves at least
speak your words with peace
before you lay out on the curb deceased
think about it its absurd to beat
i took my songs to street
he told me dope boy was the bomb in the street
since then my name rang like alarms in the street
who knew how long it would be
if only la knew how wrong he could be
i told you aint nobody stronger than me

[chorus]
man i told you so
they thought a pimp wasnt supposed to blow
because i was rappin about movin os and blow

and ak had the coldest flow

you thought the south wouldnt explode no more

[verse 1]
when your back was against the wall remember where could you go
remember who helped you again like he helped you before
went out the way to let you know that you aint never alone
they disrespect you come get who they left you alone
they taught you how to be weak he taught you how to be strong
taught you not to accept defeat you go all out or be gone
but it aint the same in the streets now that hes gone
he now in heaven on the throne exactly where he belong
he left millions devastated and his family mourned
sons turn to grown men since their daddy been gone
daughters grew like him or not he left his family on
even prepaid the funeral service that he had in the dome
and then they came to represent for a stand up gent
who walked it like he talked it always said what he meant
impossible to stop him had a head like cement
maybe now youll appreciate the nigga like this

[chorus]
bet you dont appreciate a nigga my type
but when i die there aint no more niggas my type
so just remember me right
bet if i let them suckers kill me tonight

[verse 2]
if they only knew the man outside of the hype
no matter what the situation was he alway try to do right
still they gossip and told lies used to take him for granted
often found it hard to relate somehow they couldnt understand it
cause that respect he gon demand it theres a problem he handle it
looked adversity in the eye he never ran from a challenge
they try to knock him off balance when the feds came and got him
did the time on their head came home they aint stop him
while them niggas used to hate him but they girl use to jock him
swear he had the type swagger that made the world stop and watch him
plus he possessed so much hustle made it impossible to top him
got better every album haters hated to see him drop em
they just talk shit from a distance when he around they playin possum
he use to scare the suckers shitless probably why them niggas shot him
guess thats what it took nothing else than what they couldve ever did about him
so go on talk shit about him at least you aint forgot about himi see

[chorus]
bet you dont appreciate a nigga my type
but when i die there aint no more niggas my type
so just remember me right

nigga who want proof 
must agree that shit idea 
cant no one undo 
i stay on my 12 
nigga who want 2 
turn a brunch into a brawl 
do what you gon do 
im wired 
hot as a bitch and still 
cool as a fridge and dear 
this year im on a mission dear 
think that was somethin listen here[intro]
rebel for the hell of it hella rich
never have to sell a brick again must i tell a bitch again
the bullshit im addressing check im on some next level shit
never been fucked in the game im celibate
rarely out my element barely out the ghetto with
one foot out and one foot in as intelligent as fellas get
listen lets settle then be clear i could fall back seven years
and still aint no one ahead of me

[verse 1]
consider it a blessing if you get to stand next to me
five star general og veteran
caked like entenmann blowing that celery
stack that cash like the us treasury
every single thing i ever did was done heavily
rap until your seventy still aint no catching me
put it on my pops big phil aunt beverly
be standing on the top still after they bury me
nose in the air so stuck up arrogant
aint got long hot songs best cherish it
cuz when i drop mine thats ova finito
you paying for your foul like a free-throw thou
now how could a nigga think that he could see me
other than the magazine covers or the tv
you know i sold more mixtapes than your cd
youre waiting on your big break praying you can beat me
you aint made it far as dc on the low
i been all around the globe like a god how they treat me
broads hit they knees eyes closed when they greet me
mouth wide open just begging me to skeet skeet
you in a deep sleep stop dreaming
im six albums in for 10 years i been fire hot steamin
the limelights mine im gleaming beaming
thats why i say im king bitch i got my reasons

[chorus]
wrist so frosty neck so chilly
all on my mind is to get more millies
niggas talk shit thats silly
shawty he aint bout that really is he
nigga im illy
hey i run this city clearly
tell em get lost im busy really
nigga im illy

[verse 2]
where niggas get off piss off
me and mine oughta take time to pop a lid off
shit all over the way bouncing me is yall
sick in yo fucking mind you figuring i would fizz off
never cooled off tip scorching
minimal injury though they wishin me maximum misfortune
number one hands down flow paints portraits
everybody think you stink like horse shit
house full of chicks on some girl next door shit
a king of oneself 30 mill out the store quick
of course this case lost all my endorsements
tripled up on real estate still buying more shit
but tip bankrupt according to your sources
im still caked up along with more reinforcements
tore shit up from the ladder to the rooftops
officially the hottest nigga rapping since tupac
before you rap bout me best ask bout me
im out my fucking mind need counseling
please dont doubt me trust me drama aint nothing
its all fun and games till somebody start bustin
limit my discussion when rappers be battling
i find out about it better get to skedaddling
pack your familys bags move em out to seattle and
we ever cross paths youll need ambulance and bandages
live life glamorous so extravagant
mandarin oriental worldwide traveling
hip hop champion for real though
you couldnt fuck with me with a brazil hoe nigga
but still though

[chorus]2x
wrist so frosty neck so chilly
all on my mind is to get more millies
niggas talk shit thats silly
shawty he aint about that really is he
nigga im illy
hey i run this city clearly
tell em get lost im busy really
nigga im illyhate the price of fame it cost to much
these niggas talk to much
im ready for whatever somebody better tell em
boy im ready for whatever
hey hey hey

even though my head in the clouds im planted on the pavement
how im walkin round people starin in amazement
i play a lot of games but well-being i aint playing wit
they so judgmental man but they dont understand
if ya life was in jeopardy everyday is you tellin me
you wouldnt need weaponry just because of ya felonies
consider this at least i got everybody sweatin me
on the streets is people who wont rest unless i rest in peace
killed my folk a year ago still in my sleep they threaten me
paranoia stressin me aint nobody protectin me
im dealing wit the pressure from my partner dyin next to me
think cause no ones arrested they comin for me eventually
this was all the things that i was goin through mentally
this could be the reason i ignored the penitentiary
not mentionin new orleans niggas comin in the city
killin all summer long aint nobody pay attention

now is it that hard to understand if ya listen
either die or go to jail thats a hell of decision
but im wrong and i know it my excuse is unimportant
im just tryin to let you know that i aint think i had a choice for real

i had straps in my ride gotta go to prison
you waitin on me to die you gon be waitin for a minute
boy im ready for whatever somebody better tell em
i be here when the smoke clear and everything settle for real
cant afford the price of fame cause it cost too much
plus these sucka niggas lame and they talk to much
thats why im ready for whatever somebody better tell em
i be here when the smoke clear and everything settle for real

for real ay for real
i say when everything settle for real
ay for real ay for real
i say when everything settle for real

im a man i aint perfect i admit it im guilty
but understand feel me i was ridin filthy
cause niggas out there plottin to rob me and kill me
500000 every year spent on security
my future was bright but now its gettin blurry
cause niggas in a hurry to find me and bury me
but surely godll deliver me up out it
im a fighter to the heart ill forever be about it
im a father to my sons asset to my community
look all that i done done my good outweigh the negativity
ay mentally i was focused on not lettin history repeat itself
thats why heat was kept in the vicinity
yes officially i broke the law but not maliciously
through all of the publicity was anyone considerin
my position and the logic hid in my decision
but they caught me wit em now im off to prison period

but is it that hard to understand if ya listen
either die or go to jail thats a hell of decision
but im wrong and i know it my excuse is unimportant
im just tryin to let you know that i aint think i had a choice for real

i had straps in my ride gotta go to prison
you waitin on me to die you gon be waitin for a minute
boy im ready for whatever somebody better tell em
i be here when the smoke clear and everything settle for real
cant afford the price of fame cause it cost too much
plus these sucka niggas lame and they talk to much
thats why im ready for whatever somebody better tell em
i be here when the smoke clear and everything settle for real

no way should reflection be mistaken for glorification
now i remember so vivid me and my niggas was living
sub-standard condition still handling business
still laughing and tripping still having the bitches
im rapping now reminiscing and god damn it we did it
from trapping standing and pitching with rich we stand in the kitchen
splitting it eight ways flipping it eight days
thought that while in a room it was just the way to behave
kept the weight and the yey for most the paper we made in all dimes
i aint lying the pleasure was all mine
have big work to move but we served the small time
i always outshined the niggas with small minds
who would of thought we would be arguably the greatest of all time
around here we developed such a sound down here
but duplicate it off the steel it can only be found here
only listen to gs that other shit i dont hear
shit they so far in the rear why would i even care
im too busy being a player staring at niggas careers
but talk about it for years and now we finally here

i used to dream i used to dream oh woah
about the money and the cars and girls and the girls
but now i sing now i sing oh woah
because im sitting on top of the world the whole world

ludacris
they say what goes up must come down but i aint reached my cruising altitude
take a look at what i did but can you imagine what im about to do
the places im bout to go and the money im bout to see
gave bill gates some binoculars and said look out for me
exceeded expectations even at def jam
cause i married the streets and atlanta has been my best man
my momma quit her job and now she works with six figures
cause im a self-made nappy-headed rich nigga
private planes help me travel in peace
to four cities in one day and four countries in one week
cause i work for myself and no one else cause im too smart to
put one of my partners right through culinary art school
now he my personal chef so that bread he get it
put them all in houses cleaned up all of my friends credit
and now they witness all the glitz and the glamor
catch us eating at straits atlanta with women with table manners
order in singapore and lobster
celebrating coming from nothing to winning grammys and rappers winning oscars
and they say rappers shouldnt act nah suckers
we see samuel jackson like whats up mother fucker

i used to dream i used to dream oh woah
about the money and the cars and girls and the girls
but now i sing now i sing oh woah
because im sitting on top of the world the whole world
and now i sing sing sing sing cause im sitting on top of the world
and now i sing sing sing sing cause im sitting on top of the world

its why we got streetcred and a cool building up
say im doing too much shit i say i aint did enough
remember saying damn if i could just get to a million plus
and now im like shit what the fuck is a million bucks
triple that on my bun thanks to bigs and run
but nevermind what ive been through just look at what i become
all the shit ive avoided what i done for my sons
and daughters and momma just call her
i sold dope and dropped out of school seems its all they can see
they dont notice none of my family did that since me
i broke that cycle now my family live a life of
mandatory minimals but not when the judge sentence them
cousins in college where you think they get tuition from
jeffrey standing around wishing huh
and while you standing around looking dumb

so even though its heavy the load i will carry
grin is still bear it win and still share it
apologies to the fans i hope you can understand it
life can change your directions even when ye aint planned it
all you can do it handle it worst thing you can do is panic
use it to your advantage avoid insanity manage
to conquer every obstacle make impossible possible
even when winnings illogical losings still far from optional
ay yeah they wanna see you shot up in the hospital
but when life throw punches block and counter like a boxer do
been locked inside mi casa too long i did a song
to make it known that the king lives on pimpin

hey when i think about all my time and all my struggles 
through all my grindin and all my troubles 
man i came up from nothin  all i had was a hustle 
with a blindfold tryin to find pieces to the puzzle no muzzle 
i tell it like it is thats that right or wrong imma call it how i see it 
dont forget that impossible is nothin your environments irrelevant
just dont let your emotions overpower your intelligence 
refuse to give up your mistakes dont define you 
they dont dictate where you headin they remind you 
that time keeps tickin let your mind keep clickin 
never stop thinkin be aware of your decisions 
and beware of the collisions 
and the potholes hidden in the road that you travel on your lifelong mission 
just listen everyday like a snap shot is taken if you live you could learn to be great be patient

‘cause life is like a slide show 
verse 2 ti 
‘cause when i look back at a fly young cat 
who could rap with a dream look where i took that 
beginning on bankhead then i spread out 
vision in my head all i had to do is get it out 
when i walked out of my house and look at my street 
all i see is the opportunity that led me to truancy 
i aint really have a role model to enforce me 
uncle someone they said next its gunna be you in it 
as a juvenile count cases so fluently look at my life and learn from it dont do it 
if i only knew back then what i know now how much better life it would have been if i had slowed down 
maybe id have been kanye instead of seeing gunplay 
but god got a plan ill understand one day 
one day of life like a snap shot is taken 
if you believe you could make it have faith be patient

could this be cos of hip hop music
or did the ones with the good sense not use it
usually niggas dont know what to do when their back against the wall so they just start shootin
for red or for blue or for blow i guess
from bankhead or from your projects

i was told way back in the days when i was trappin
never mind what niggas say judge em all on their actions
its hard to imagik in the day when i was trappin
never mind what nine when you traveling
havin fun gettin paper catch a case and see how niggas act then
out a cell partner been fired he rattin on me
got a little benja pension now they turn they back on me
shit cuz out of sight is out of mind
better put your trust in god homie man will let you down everytime
and im speaking experience serious
imagine my surprise hearin from the inside
everybody talkin bout me like the nigga just died
tip gone 20 years at the least get 5
man niggas just lie for suspicion of they snitchin
not to mention the rumors of me committin suicide
god will open your eyes and show you who really with ya
but keep it in the back of your mind when its over how niggas did ya

[chorus]

[ti]
i aint never asked a nigga to do shit for me
i wouldnt do in return but guess you live and you learn
dont expect my well bein to be a nigga concern
cuz i know that aint the way the world turn
cuz everybody love to see a nigga assed out
rather see you lose it all than to see you cash out
they gossip like bitches i dont even ask how
cuz niggas aint shit i believe that now
and it dont even matter how much you do for people theyll love to
see you beat down livin in the gutta what a
shame at the least in the game when you see
they want you locked up more than the police
the same cant wait to get a nigga off the street
they hate to see me sittin on buckets off c
dog beat bet to you dont even make sense
but that mentality is exactly why youll never be rich  hater

rose to the occasion whatever situation
surprised haters and came out gun a blazin
theoretically speakin but you rather be thinkin
ill fold cuz you want a view of me i know
all i got is the family friends come and go
and with that understandin i put none before

fuck a jail i aint going tonight
quick to pull a 4-4 in the fight
under the street lights
rollin the dice
we was so enticed
by niggas like slick money and ice
we figure prison end should come with the light
along with losin your life
and there were no way we thought
wed go to jail for any case we caught
for all the yay we bought
not a dime did we say we borrowed
bought damn near every pair of jeans at the mall
had our way with the broads
hit the rink but we aint skatin at all
seem like every other day we brawl
that ak on call
when i think about all we done
its amazing to see how far we come
remember

[mitchellel - chorus]
i remember walkin

[ti - verse 2]
ay say c-roy
remember days we was slangin the hard
in a crib with no lights
we used to stay in the dark
remember captain mac bonin man
they were retarded
i dont know who kept us laughing the hardest
since our sacks was the largest
didnt take us long to corner the market
i remember everyday was a party
15 16 with dreams of being cocaine bosses
in pursuit of that
we made so many terrible choices
like the time we made away with that millennium
from the dealership
before our day won we killin em
late nights
gun fights
high speed chases
so close to the good life we taste it
damn the consequences pimp
if its a chance we take it
first case a month in juvenile and get probation
when i think about all we done
its amazing to see how far we come
remember

[mitchellel - chorus]
i remember walkin
didnt have a dollar in my pocket
now im watching stocks like whats the options

numb to the fact
that we was poisoning our own kind

young and with that attitude
somebody finally gimme that
i aint give a fuck how i got it
it was real as that
so if i had to peel a cat

cant work too hard to get my money

slave for the next man a raise nigga fuck you

and even though they steady changin

i admit yeah i done some dumb sh-t
disappointed everybody i know

try not to hold that against me though
my road to redemption has no gps
so guess the time must be invested for this to be manifested
yes its hard living life in the spotlight
trying to dodge the haters same time as the cop light
the bible say let he without sin cast the stone first stone first
the sinner or the one who judged him who was wrong first
yeah he go to work never done no drugs or to be fair
he just drink his liquor touch his kids beat his wife instead
difference is my shortcomings hit the media
thanks to tmz the ajc and wikipedia
see the stairway to heaven while stepping down jacobs ladder
my good outweigh the bad god aint that what really matters nope
a matter of fact im wrong but after that the good ive done in your hood
should it overshadow that
got the world laughing at me for the moment
but it gonna be your turn fore its over with
even if you so legit that you get a house with a dog and a picket fence

[chorus]

right or wrong
let me go

[verse 1 ti]
my mama loved me more than i do
she said you pap was just like you
trapped in a vicious cycle
jesus youngest disciple
tell the judge if he throwed the book at me make it the bible
start callin myself the king for lack of a better title
loyal beyond belief to my detriment
its so vital i change or blow opportunities like a choir recital
now while i do not care who tellin meanwhile sellin powder puts food in the bellies
well its unfortunate
the orphanage couldnt keep up the mortgages
kid go to school stupid they teachers ignorin it
sort of just doomed forced into bein a goon sell the kush in a jar
mix a guitar in a balloon
consumed with the same way of life i left
everything i know now learned by myself
all you see are the whips
the maseratis ferraris
so they dont sympathize
dont nobody feel sorry
no mercy

[the dream]
theres no mercy for me
no crying myself to sleep
no mercy for me
nightmares have become my dreams
no mercy for me
good morning reality
will i wake well never know
im late for my date with destiny

[verse 2 ti]
everybodys standin &amp; waitin  theyre hatin
gospels say they should forgive me
theyd rather hand me to satan
blatant displays the day of hypocrisy
boy you got to be kiddin
could it be possibly second comin to pac is me
remember that when he was here
and when he died you realized you need him here
god with me partner
aint no one for me to fear
hindsight 20/20
future not as clear
but im a rider til i die
put bullets tween my eye
i just ask that i can make my peace with god &amp; say goodbye
fuck up the world like lady di hone the day he died
his wife &amp; sons &amp; daughters know that every day he tried to be a person nah they wanted better verses
they could market to the merchants
but when they closed curtains hey you could be for certain aint nobody perfect
but when your rich nobody gives a shit
no mercy

[the dream]
theres no mercy for me
no crying myself to sleep
no mercy for me
nightmares have become my dreams
no mercy for me
good morning reality
will i wake well never know
im late for my date with destiny
let me go
youve got to let me go
let me go
let me go
let me go[chorus]

everyone thinks that i have it all
but its so empty living behind these castle walls
these castle walls

if i should tumble if i should fall
would anyone hear me screaming behind these castle walls
theres no one here at all behind these castle walls

ti
observing the estate through the gate from the outside looking in
bet you would think i got it made better look again
i got a butler got a maid and a mansion
the belief is that im living out a millionaires fantasy

with phantoms and ferraris in the driveway
but you see the pain and the change of the same mans sanity
your vision jaded by the grammys on the mantelpiece
just switch your camera lenses you would see the agony

apparently its damaging the man you see before
you on the canvas he may seem alright but all the disadvantages
his family encounters overshadows his extravagance
walk in my nines awhile i dare you i scare you

while it really seem like the kings life seem glamorous
as seen through the eyes of untrained amateurs
because the cameras dont see beyond the walls of the smiles
only counts until it falls in the pile

christina aguilera
everyone thinks that i have it all
but its so empty living behind these castle walls
these castle walls

if i should tumble if i should fall
would anyone hear me screaming behind these castle walls
theres no one here at all behind these castle walls

ti
honestly to me i think id lose every benefit
of all that ive accomplished if my kids never win at shit
me knowing this why should the verses i have laid
be more important to me than the persons i have raised

i guess im saying that to say that opportunity
but they just dont equate to all the time they take away
from the kids all the shit i did right is a mistake
if deyjah end up a stripper and major out there slinging yay

how could i ever consider myself a great
if messiah aint paid and nique nique aint straight
would your favourite song about the whips money and shit
be relevant if you found out the money wasnt real nope

so me being the goat shouldnt mean more to me
than see it to a king though
from a bad ass kid to man with some dough
otherwise i may well have stayed poor

so while they stay focused on me beefin with flip
shawty low gucci or ludacris or if im fucking with a hoe
did i snitch when i got arrested or will i die over nonsense
internally im dealing with this conflict

so excuse me if i dont get the chance to kiss the hand
or slap me in the face ay im just the man
if they saying i aint the best at making hit records
its cause this my life these aint just rapping

shit you think of that deep did ya dawg
see you cant see the castle through the walls till it falls
bitch aint thinking with the deep did ya dog
cause see you cant see the castle through the walls till it falls

christina aguilera
everyone thinks that i have it all
but its so empty living behind these castle walls
these castle walls

if i should tumble if i should fall
would anyone hear me screaming behind these castle walls
theres no one here at all behind these castle walls

nobody knows im all alone
living in this castle made of stone
they say that money is freedom
but i feel trapped inside it all

and while i sit so high up on a throne
i wonder how i can feel this low

on top of the world its beautiful
but theres no place to fall

ti
for the record ay i could give a damn if i never sell shit again
my career was meant for me to come and tell it
honest interpretation of how affected im faced with
matters most rappers used to keep locked away in the basement

the day that i walk i aint saying that im amazing
down playing the way i keep fellas from catching cases
wont take into consideration how much it mean what im saying
and when i say what i mean even when im sorrounded by the fakers

from one of the greatest centers blessed with most of gods graces
who made his way amongst the greatest from the grimiest places
so next time you rating royalty
im always being given to recordings than the level of your loyalty

obvious youve been ignoring me
who else ya seen make it through the storm unharmed this charming
while all the critics was looking for prince charming
disregarded the king of the south raised doubt

even though he made a castle out of used to be a house
he did shit that all your favorites rappers only rap about
but most of yall dont see the castle through the walls
and the smiles till it falls in piles so while

christina aguilera
everyone thinks that i have it all
but its so empty living behind these castle walls
these castle walls

if i should tumble if i should fall
would any one hear me screaming behind these castle walls
theres no one here at all behind these castle wallsi never let you down imma shine on sight
keep your mind on your grind and off of mines alright
hard imma ball on them squares i flow
quarter-million dollar cars everywhere i go

i know in the lead it may seem me might be
but no matter what they doing they dont do it like me
like a g i hold it down for the town im at
in a flash like that recognize im back

strike a match catch a fire any moment i decide
thats enough of all your lies boy your buzz just died
step inside super fly to the shoes in they coupe
then exit out with all the bitches like we always do

my desire to retire grow with every new crew
cause these guys just dont ride like my nigga you too
tight jeans funny haircuts dancing on the screen
its about the real niggas in the game so it seems

just pretend to holla pimpin givin shit a black eye
next he say he trapping in my head im like why
be yourself you aint gotta pimp bone in your body
i can tell ya aint never bought a key or caught a body

nigga probably just seen wayne gucci mane me and boosie

listen do for you that aint in the cars
think the power is in your gun but overall its in your heart

nowadays i dont know whats up with niggas in the a
guess he think he in the game but he really in the way
violating i was having conversations in the joint
but guess who done it and i promised i would put you on point

im disappointed in you dog you aint hold it down at all
but i aint going near ya jaw just gonna show ya how to ball

i seen real gs destroyed by real suckers
innocent ladies raped and defenseless babies abducted
such a horrible truth but you see it over and over
its nothing you numb to it and your heart grow colder
pacify your pain with a chain and a rover
fuck it justify your action by stacking your dough up
you show up with a brick of cocaine and baking soda
just enough for me to blow up nigga hold up
switch the flow up cause these niggas be snitchin so much
i promise all they missings the badge coffee and donut
go to jail so what never see my integrity perish
that aint the harris way study my pedigree
promise im one of the only ones who keep it 100
probably why i think they all out to get me you cant convince me
large money and fame will plant seeds of envy
to make my partners resent me enough to come and get me
catch me slippin and hit me just like they did 50
cause im in the position that he think he should be given
listen dawg the fact of the matter is
im on a narrow path and we all cant travel

what should i be sorry for
who should i be sorry to
what should i be sorry for
who should i be sorry to
the fact is you cant please everybody
you cant please everybody
what should i be sorry for
who should i be sorry to

what it aint what it is
even if you gotta live
i learned that apartment is way more exciting than a big ass house on a hill
i used to be a way better writer and a rapper
when i used to want a black karmann ghia
now a nigga speeding in a porsche
feeling like im going off a course
cut these fuck niggas off
nigga tip in my life scream that till im hoarse
duck these get the fuck off me projectiles
bitch you aint really got a choice
im living my life live yours
i dont even like rapping fast but thats how the word come to me
talk to me sideways nigga thats your ass
slow it down this that shit thatll make you call your momma
say hey im sorry for begging for all them clothes you couldnt afford
and this the type of shit thatll make you call your rap partner
and say im sorry im awkward my fault for fuckin up the tours
i hated all the attention so i ran from it
fuck it if we did but i hope we aint lose no fans from it
im a grown-ass kid you know aint never cared about no damn money
why do we try so hard to be stars just to dodge comments
and this that shit thatll make you call your baby mama
when you gone on half a pill dont know why but that i did
then you take a flight back to the crib yall make love like college kids
and you say all the shit you gon do better we can try this shit again
round the time the dope wear off you feel stupid she feel lost
thats that dope i mean i mean dopamine you think cupid done worn off
waiting in the hallway with her arms crossed
her baby boy face full of applesauce
maybe should have stayed but it aint yo fault
too much pressure i fell off im sorry
was young and had to choose between you
and what the rest of the world might offer me shit what would you do
well id probably do it differently if second the chance
only if some cool ass older man wouldve let me know in advance
this this quarry that is dug so deep in a fathers chest
when he feel that hes broken up his nest
and he figured shit he was just doing the best that he could
which end up being the worst that he could
and all some pussy nigga on the internet can say is that verse aint good
its boring - boring
really

when im disgusted with this world and i can hardly breathe and
told so many lies dont know what to believe
i discussed it with this girl and this is what she said
she said lay down baby baby rest your weary head up
i love these distractions but my mind dont wanna rest
but my body disagree so i laid up on her breasts yes
ooh you are so fucking fine
i woke up the next morning with new purpose on my mind

ooh who pulls your ponytail

fist fights in night clubs for rap beefs
shootings retaliations yes that deed
i guess they just got to catch me when they catch me
because im putting it in they life if they attempt to disrespect me
especially when i know they say what go around come around

i go get itaye have you ever loved somebody so much you cant stand it but cant do without him
do anything for him cause you truly do adore him
like dedicate songs write poems
but they be on that bullshit and you try to ignore him
but you feel like they feel like you aint right for him
therefore your hearts torn
between being with him forever leaving him never
but it seem like you argue and fighting over whatever
maybe we can leave find someone better
even though you will you never know none better
my heart says nah she cant leave me never
been head over heels since the very day i met er
feel so deep in love i aint been able to get up
sometimes i want some peace of mind cause she dont shut up
love her to death dont know whether to kiss er or kill er

shouldve known it
from the start it was already over
now were just too dumb to notice
every paper
even love couldnt save us
we wake up
on a bed of guns and roses

and we dont know which one to choose
but either way were gonna lose
stupid paper
even love couldnt save us
we wake up
on a bed of guns and roses
hah i guess id rather suffer with her than be miserable without er
i ball out of prada gucci and belinciaga
they keep her content you keep down the nonsense
with every corner we turn around the conflict
mostly dumb shit like who she run with
where the fuck have you been your pants – they dont fit
really honestly speaking some things i dont get
no matter how much she try she cant make it make more sense
therefore here we go again
screaming yelling at the top of our lungs she going in
seeing the kind of shit i be like if you was a man
i would go in your shit real no shit
but i love her so much that i cant forget
that the feel of a kiss it could heal when im sick
still i dont like to feel like this
if i wouldnt miss er i would try to get a kill right there

shouldve known it
from the start it was already over
now were just too dumb to notice
every paper
even love couldnt save us
we wake up
on a bed of guns and roses

and we dont know which one to choose
but either way were gonna lose
stupid paper
even love couldnt save us
we wake up
on a bed of guns and roses

every time we say our goodbyes
a little piece of my heart breaks off inside
i dont really ever know why
if i could live without you id try

shouldve known it
from the start it was already over
now were just too dumb to notice
every paper
even love couldnt save us
we wake up
on a bed of guns and roses

and we dont know which one to choose
but either way were gonna lose
stupid paper
even love couldnt save us
we wake up
on a bed of guns and rosesswinging through with something new top down riding clean

cuz it seem like you wanted other things than da king
why you fightin fussin cussin and disagreein wit da king
when you got cribs cars bling and a king wit da king
is the grass as green as it seemed in ya dreams
are you gettin all the things that you needed and i aint bring
does it satisfy your self-esteem bein seen on da screen
is this new nigga the real thing or is just a lil fling
did he buy a nice bracelet and get ya a lil ring
or give you all the attention and the lil things
he know what to do with the stuff you stuff in them lil jeans
do he stand up and lean in it til you start screamin 
or smack your ass and kiss your g-string to start eatin muah
you get how you need it not only when its convenient
i just pick up the phone and call you every week or two to let you know i miss you

was it and this pain i feel it never goes away
does it this load i carry get no lighter
i grew up all on my own with a broken heart and a broken home
taught me everything ive known
owe you everything i own
i must admit you raised a warrior my life could be a story book
hope you proud of me didnt graduate from college but
thanks for listening to me
so long i had this problem dog
til we meet in person lets keep speaking through my verses for life

and you can tell everybody
this is your song
this is your song
and you can tell everybody
this is your song
said this is your song

i hope you dont mind
i hope you dont mind
that i put down in words
how wonderful life likejesus loves me
this i know
for the bible tells me so

sometimes i wake up feel like im in forest city arkansas
although im free im still a prisoner of all our soul
sometimes i lead it roof in 4 you never ride down since
just prayin homie and reminiscin
sometimes my nightmare seems so real feel like im still in prison
i reach out far to meet her hand im trippin cause she listen
its pitch black dawg like im in solitary
so if my freedom was a dream lord please prepare me
it seems like satan want my soul and he refuse to share me
my former 3 aint talk about me like im getting buried
bastards want me in the casket for my head cold
trouble in my soul these devils got a hold
did everything you need to kill me like you did to joe
he took my diamonds took my rhymes took my fame and gold
he took my babysitters he took my wife and kids
but he cant take nothing god cant give me back again

hallelujah hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah

i went to jail stood tall then i fell again
it seems like im jonah and right back in that will again
i felt the panic when they locked me in that cell again
i had to pray and meditate control my breath again
like lazarus ive risen from a better death again
the lord is with me i could stand against a thousand men
i read the songs of david prayed to be like solomon
gods wisdom walkin all amongst these hollow men
im a king i dare to lead when they just follow me
i see a better way im keeping my eyes on the sparrow
im exiting my egypt tell em wave goodbye to pharaoh
mother told me fore she left this earth that i was special
ever cause im special they gon make me suffer
like they crucified jesus right in front his mother
suckas but he arose on the 3rd day
just save your head and get a favor let the church say

hallelujah hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah

jesus loves me
this i know
for the bible tells me so
yes he loves me
this i know

on chrome with a tec taught to spray for respect
i learned from the best used to stay in the jects
bought work from the vets burning rubber in the vettes
this as good as it gets used to play with the rats
then i got older and learned stay away from the rats
god blessed this nigga to hustle up and make eight figures
turned from a goon to a great young nigga
no complaining just doing what it take young nigga
i was raised in a decade of hate young nigga
always dodging polices because they hate young niggas
and we hate them too 38 in him shoe
all the changes the system will take him through
he aint a killer but he will if you make him do it
homicide hell ride theyll put him on trial
let him have a life sentence then do it with a smile
and he only 19 he aint even had a child
as a child told his mama hell be gone for a while
and she cried still they just put him inside
now she all on her own because her other son died
listen to the politician as he lied and he lied
he a snake in a suit trying to hide in disguise

young nigga rolling weed in a cigar he can light
bang red either blue selling hard and the white
live by the gun never run from a fight
trayvon in a hoodie walking through the neighborhood he
didnt do shit to buddy he didnt have to die did he
i guess its because his dad was a judge in the city
they didnt want him in the pen with the thugs that could get him
a jury of his peers said all was forgiven
but touch one of mine right or wrong imma kill them
fill them with the lead like they put in martin luther kings head
like they killed malcolm x edgar hoover did that
you can catch me in the hood where they shooting niggas at
they dont know if neighborhood or the hoovers did that
whether piru or vls or gds wit me we
