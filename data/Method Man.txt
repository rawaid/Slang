we gonna eat or die tryin got my mind made up
young buck just dont give a fuck pressin they luck
when they best best to give it up perfect world
baby what  nigga head or gut them or us
welcome to the dark ages dirty pages 
of filth fine filth flavors
dust to dust and ashes to ashes life flashes
right before his eyes then he passes

	while the 666 got more tricks
	than the pds got bricks
	from bloods and crips
	to pips with mints
	we still lickin the scars from whips on slave ships

mr sandman bring em a dream infa-red light beams
homicide scene perfect world
by any means get cream
just dont let it come between you and i seen
everything is everything in this three ringed circus

[masta killa]
yo yo
brain gets punctured and drained through the nasal
hour of assassination be upon you
movin with the tiger strike bound gagged and shot
red the head in dapple light centered
east remains hot with police
but i keep a lease for my four-fifth automatic
extended clip rewind bust mine
anytime you reveal your snakeish ways and actions
observe the magnetic attraction

[method man]
and its time for some grid

[street life]
iron rap action-packed grudge match
tough act to follow hard copy novel
throw you off the verrazano
we swimmin with these sharks yo i rate bodyguard
stamp my initial in your birthmark
plo bust like a calico tally hoe
black expo tecs in afros we back yo
its dolemite crash your windpipe with the mic device
fatal strike daily mic fights shoot out the street lights

[method man]
sight beyond sight late night city light
tight like a virgin mergin with my a-alikes

chorus method man

[inspektah deck]
yo i bring chaos to blocks like the riots in watts
rapid fire shots ripple through kevlar 9 glocks
technique of rhyme pop machine gun ammo
sporadic flow buckled a foe intro to outro
calico throw verse but slide my dough first
i make thousands in the club with no shirts go bezerk
from the shao borough whylin out on the furlow
commando styles thorough solo inferno
it burns slow thermonuclear degrees
heads are underseas down to the youngest seeds
wannabes clone they light like summer breeze
hundred gs for the garden them fans stampede
for the top cats hit the mic like the iron-palm blast
equipped to perform the task
s-i-n-y and what head or gut
the head rush will cause your cerebellum to bust

[killa sin]
we be the worlds most fabulous
hazardous to fuck with these ravenous
killers get you stuck to the wall like wooden cabinets
extravagant je-wel drop a helicopter high
up into the sky lines philosiphize i got stocks to buy
watch my pockets rise to the bottom bust confide in god
in sin i trust the villianous criminal minded killers rust
i intend to build and fortify in men
mastermind rhymin navigate the globe then retire quick

[raekwon]

three young cats strapped with gats decided to ride out one night
the in-flight drug used to induce the hindsight was dust
the moonlight was robust but they couldnt see the beauty in it
their duty in it was to carry out another senseless killin
senses and feelings distorted they boarded their vessel nessel
discreet in crotches and underneath seats they tuck heat
to complete the mission they had no decision in
no longer do they use our light and dark
used to create the vision in our towns
but now they red and blue override our brown skin
weve been conditioned to let off them rounds when we see another color rag
or hear another brother brag about what set he claimin
poverty drugs and poor education should be the target
but we wont stay gamin that
well kill and maim another cat like theres no shame in that
like theres fame in that
we hang out them car windows and bust them slugs
in the name of genocide in disguise so we dont take blame for that
but if theres honor amongst you thieves in life
then what the fuck you hidin for
recognize your deed to trife and decide what the fuck you ridin formake marijuana legal make marijuana legal
make marijuana legal make marijuana legal well speak your mind then
ok i will no one has the right to tell me what i can do with my own body
what i can eat drink or smoke this is a free country
and no one can take away my constitutional rights
hey man can you put me on and i can say anything i want
is that what i need to do yea
then why isnt alcohol made illegal why isnt that
while you drinking it it hang on and disposes your liver
besides that its a habitat for alcohol
besides that cigarettes are much worse than pot
no one ever got killed by pot you tell em you tell em
god damn it man everything you can get us anything you want
anything you want marijuana legal
make marijuana legal whats so bad anyway
whats so bad about feeling good
theres nothing wrong with blowing crack yea

leave birds with permanent scars and shit like birthmarks
digi bark back at dogs snatch flies from frogs
blow california chronic to despise the smog

then move through your community with diplomat immunity
move to rep a two or g shine like fine jewelry

cause she got alotta love for me and put it on me
if i need that plus she understand me when i beat that
its sweet like candy this time i might just eat that
you steal my heart sweetheart then you can keep that
lets bar hop and find us a spot where we can chief at
push the seats back you got the kinda body niggaz beep at

sophisticated miss highly edumicated
living well lady that made it type of woman you stay with

[chorus]

[method man]
give me a queen that respects a king just like coretta

cause broken hearts leave big scars when emotions get hit hard
niggaz get drunk and hit the strip bar
but that aint even ya mans style even back as a manchild

im throwing rocks at your window pane


trying to bang girl like injure pain you know the game
