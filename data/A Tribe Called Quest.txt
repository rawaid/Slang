q-tip
q-tip is my title
i dont think that is vital for me to be your idol
but dig this recital
if you cant envision a brother who aint dissin
slingin this and that cause this and that was missin
instead its been injected the tribe has been perfected
oh yes its been selected the art makes it protected
afrocentric livin africans be givin
a lot to the cause cause the cause has been risen
some brothers they be flammin thinkin we aint slammin
comin off like the days where we used to wear the tans and
a blue-colllar talker a hemisphere stalker
a glass of oj and a ten mile walk-a
if youre in a jeep and you dig what youre hearin
can i get a beep and a side order of cheerin
i am what i am thats a tribal man
we all know the colours we all must stand
as we start our travels things they will unravel
que sera sera for this unit is like gravel
wont be gone for long listen to the song
if you cant pull it all ya gotta do is

chorus
push it along push it along
push it along yeah push it along repeat 4x

phife dawg
put one up for the phifer its time to decipher
the ills of the world make the situation lighter
the clock is always tickin the systems should be kickin
like  ham and eggs i eat chicken chicken chicken
should i release the lever the lever of the clever
embelish on the funk as we start to endeavour
the wraughts of the rap filling up the gap
with the smash of a hand and a little toe tap

q-tip
the boom the bip the boom bip
indicates to the brothers that we be on the flip tip
phonies start to crumble funky rhythm rumbles
through the dance-hall but my anthem is humble
its the nitty-gritty my time is itty-bitty
so i kick the slash for the gipper and the witty
this aint trial and error more like tribe and error
constantly rude as some sort of tribal terror
the street cant depart from the bloody heart
repair the wear and tear dont start fore it starts
wont be gone for long listen to the song
if you cant pull it all ya gotta do is

repeat chorus

q-tip
marchin off the project we hope that you will subject
its good to be an object and never ever reject
the tribe who meanders with drunken propoganda
keep it in boom and never will we slander
 should be handed dont let me demand it
money gives a nudge to the poet star bandit
control it then recluse it follow you wont lose it
mysterious is the tribe for we choose it
although shes flippin crazy give my love to gracy
god could you help cause this quest is crazy spacey
the pigs are wearin blue and in a year or two
well be goin up the creek in a great big canoe
what we gonna do save me and my brothers
hop inside the bed and pull over the covers
never will we do that and we aint tryin to rule that
we just want a slab of the ham dont you know black
this society of fake reality
are nothin but a peg of informality
while i sing my song sing it all day long
if you cant pull it all ya gotta do is

repeat chorusq-tip
brother brother brother lucien youre like no other
listen very close cause i dont like to boast
instead ill tell the tale of a french who prevailed
through the mr crazy rabbits who were always on his tail
when in on sale your roomie starts to wail
get caught with stolen goods and you will go to jail
if you go to jail then who will pay the bail
theyll put you back to france on a ship with a sail
escargot lucien you eat snails
hey yo tip whats wrong with snails
from the zulu nation from a town called paris
came to america to find liberty
instead of finding pleasure all you found was misery
but listen lucien you have a friend in me
oh luck luck will drive your butt batty
next time you get some wheels make it a caddy
in terms of doing good i know you wish you really could
but listen brother man i really think you can
succeed with the breed of the brothers on your back
its the creme de la creme and you can bounce with that
itll take a minute rice so take my advice
trust in us and thus you trust in your life
lucine lucien lucien lucien - you should know

q-tip
are you ready lu this one is for you
comin from a true-blue fits like a shoe
cómo está usted or comment allez-vous
lucien ill leave it up to you
voulez-vous  vous
rendez-vous vous
coucou cou 
les poo-poo poo
watch that lass gonna backlash fast
can you get a grip on the crackhead dip
sold you a paper bag guess he saw you comin
vcr from a neck-bone bummin
$10 brother he was hummin and strummin
only had 20 he was livin like ya slummin
gave him the money well i thought that was somethin
lookin like a kid who was lost in crumbin
dont worry about a thing i wont get specific
this is a song that is long and prolific
think of the stuff that i said if you can
figure it out compute understand
no problemo ill help you with your demo
if you go to the store for me
lucien im just kiddin - you should know

q-tip
you gotta get a grip on the missions youll be takin
not so much the mission but you got crazy ignition
sure the sugar-babies wanna give you a chance
with the french savoir faire and the sexy dance
but is she really fly or is she a guy
i wont ask why cause i know that you try
you try too hard is that the answer to the riddle
instead of doin so much why dont you do just a little
boy what a cad i guess we shouldnt treat him bad
in fact it would be nice if we understood him like
a case of positionin the feet in the shoes
sympathetic reason in the case of the blues
lucien is blue even though hes really brown
i had to make the sound his life is too profound
on the up-and-up hes somethin like a little pup
young and naive its hard to believe
as long as youre strong you can quest with the questers
jolly like a jumping bean or a jester
lucien lucien lucien lucien - you should knowchorus after hours it was cool  x8

q-tip

ten after one i think ill hop the horse
downtown late of three of course
just came from fishing couldnt get a catch
downtown theyll probably have a batch
a whiting sandwich and a guinness stout
but with the beer though i had a bout
so i exchanged it for some apple juice
i had the blues but i shook them loose
a jeep is blasting from the urban streets
loots of funk over hardcore beats
the moon dabbles in the morning sky
as the minutes just creep on by
i get a thought and hear comes my tribe
ritual shakes and in good vibes
like always the quest begins
in the mist though but the rhyths move in
we find a spot and we sit and chat
speaking on the status quo of rap
a derelick makes a real long speach
we pay attention to the words he read
when he was done we rattled on
there was no lunch because it wasnt dawn
we pointed things out about this times
the worlds famons and the crazy crimes
inflation of the nation it bothers me
i better go gold to pay the taxes
gotta be swift society
the man whose made is the man who maxes
the grounds for living are being discussed
as we go it gets close to dusk
gather thoughts and savor breath
cause theres only a few hours left

chorus
after hours it was cool x8

q-tip

me ohh my hey-hey hey-hey
the human hours are here to stay
this is how it seems my witness
bug out all night ask phife hes with this
girls be screaming on this conversation
i have my two cents for a revelation
and my watch continuously tic-tocs
shaheed will bring up the beats that rocks
i hear the frogs and the smashing of bottles
a car revs up and i hear it trottle
it probably moves with the morning wind
ohh my god heres phife again
 talking about last nights game
trying to remember someones name
so hear the frogs dancing in the streets
once again ali will bring up the beat
like this

sounds of frogs

q-tip

the beat is over and so is the night
the sun is risen and the shine is bright
we all say peace and go our separate ways
youth is fading as we gain our days
explanation for the song is simp
the hours creep excuse me i mean limp
as we go you hear a gasp of laugh
as we start up our rhythmic path
like this

chorusq-tip
as we start trudgin me and my brothers we be lookin and be buggin
vehicles of life they be rollin and be mergin
searchin for the virgins of life
that be shovin out the door thats crack
the valleys of time are always on my feet
as least the beat will combine
the calluses and corns with the funky bassline
you dont need underdog for a nickel shoeshine or the shoes thats phat
well can i get a level on the bass and on the treble
footin up and down like a unlv rebel
the answer be amongst us cos we rarely dig acoustics
cant be too much flackin not too much packin
you must container that at least to dip your hand in rap
your feet will be infectious so at least realise the fact
the rhythms are inserted and the nurse can be converted
this aint rock n roll cos the rap is in control
if youre a megastar worth will buy you a car
id rather go barefootin for prints i will be puttin
all over the earth if we can get there first
now that we are in it footprints are bein printed
so fi you recognise em you can try to size em
theyll probably be the ones with the size not fryin
all over reveal you wont have to yield
if you want protection you can hide behind the shield

q-tip
you can game on the gallons if you really need to rock
but we walk while we talk as we stompin through the block
hand in hand cross the land as muhammad cross the fade
its a tribe who meanders precious like a jade
its a art theo arch rhymes the ground placed upon
the mind will unwind it will soft to beyond
catch the track track by track get a map to track a trail
you will find yourself behind for a map does not prevail
see the levels peakin as the rhythms keep-a screechin
a quest oh yes a quest inside the jam i will keep preachin
the point oh yes the point because its close but yet so far
the loudiness is ringin as we scoot across the star
we are bulgin im indulgin in a rat-a-tat-tat
explanation for the liners that the rhythm is phat
keep it wild wide and deep you could dig it in a jeep
but dig it in the ground because the foot print now

q-tip
if theres a storm thats brewin it wont keep us from doin
our thing as we start swingin travellin is bringin
joy inside the domes as we hit the road to roam/rome
a chair is not a chair a house is not a home
because my skin is brown yo im gonna do the town
rub it in the face and rub my feet all through the place
when you get your finger on the music itll linger
sing a song o sixpence sing it like a singer
a nubian a nubian a proud one at that
remember me the brother who said black is black
you can come by request i dont play i dont dress
get emotions off your chest we are black we the best
makin moves makin motions flowin like an ocean
the walkin will continue we know that we will bring you
the times that you have waited more anticipated
be gone but not for long because the feet will stay strongleft my wallet in el segundo

i gotta get it i got-got ta get it
i left my wallet in el segundo

my mother went away for a month-long trip
her and some friends on an ocean-liner ship
she made a big mistake by leaving me home
i had to roam so i picked up the phone
dialed ali up to see what was going down
told him i pick him up so we could drive around
took the dodge dart a 74
my mother left a yard but i needed one more
shaheed had me covered with a hundred greenbacks
so we left brooklyn and we made big tracks
drove down the belt got on the conduit
came to a toll we paid and went through it
had no destination we was on a quest
ali laid in the back so he can get rest
drove down the road for two days and a half
the sun had just risen on a dusty path
just then a figure had caught my eye
a man with a sombrero who was four feet high
i pulled over to ask were we was at
his index finger he tipped up his hat
el segundo he said my name is pedro
if you need directions ill tell you pronto
needed civilization some sort of reservation
he said a mile south theres a fast food station
thanks senor as i start up the motor
ali said damn tip what you drive so far for

well describe to me what the wallet looks like

anyway a gas station we passed
we got gas and went on to get grub
it was a nice little pub in the middle of nowhere
anywhere would have been better
i ordered enchiladas and i ate em
ali had the fruit punch
when we finished we thought for ways to get back
i had a hunch
ali said pay for lunch so i did it
pulled out the wallet and i saw this wicked 
beautiful lady she was a waitress there
put the wallet down and stared and stared
to put me back into reality heres shaheed
yo tip man you got what you need
i checked for keys and started to step 
but what do you know my wallet i forget

yo it was a brown wallet it had props numbers 
had my jimmy hats i got to get it man

lord have mercy
the heat got hotter ali starts to curse me
i feel bad but he makes me feel badder
chit-chit-chatter car stars to scatter
breaking on out we was northeast bound
jettin on down at the speed of sound
three days coming and three more going
we get back and there was no slack

i see ya there tryin to make amends
try to make some friends but now my story ends oh man
on the note that i just wrote
stay afloat on the reality boat oh
slow down and think and take it cool
and try to avoid the description of aq-tip
back in the days when i was a teenager
before i had status and before i had a pager
you could find the abstract listening to hip hop
my pops used to say it reminded him of be-bop
i said well daddy dont you know that things go in cycles
the way that bobby brown is just ampin like michael
its all expected things are for the lookin
if you got the money quest is for the bookin
come on everybody lets get with the fly modes
still got room on the truck load the back boom
listen to the rhyme to get a mental picture
of this black man through black woman victim
why do i say that cuz i gotta speak the truth man
doing what we feel for the music is the proof and
planted on the ground the act is so together
bonafide strong you need leverage to sever
the unit yes the unit yes the unit called the jazz is
deliberately cheered lp filled with street goods
you can find it on the rack in your record store store
if you get the record then your thoughts are adored 
and appreciated cause were ever so glad we made it
we work hard so we gotta thank god
dishin out the plastic do the dance till youre spastic
if you dis it gets drastic
listen to the rhymes cuz its time to make gravy
if it moves your booty then shake shake it baby
all the way to africa aka the motherland uh
stick out the left then ill ask for the other hand
thats the right hand black man man
only if you are noted as my man man
if i get the credit then ill think i deserve it 
if you fake moves dont fix your mouth to word it
get in the zone of positivity not negativity
cuz we gotta strive for longevity
if you botch up whats in that ass what
a pair of nikes size ten-and-a-half come on come on

chorus

we gotta make moves
never ever ever could we fake moves come on come on 4x

time time is a ship on a merciless sea
drifting toward an average of nothingness
until it can be retarded for its own destiny
time is an inanimate object
praying and praying and praying with no justification for belief
time is dancing moving lingering all memories of past
	- the last poets

we gotta be a winner all the time
cant fall prey to a hip hop crime
with the dope raps and dope tracks for you for blocks
from the fly girlies to the hardest of the rocks
musically the quest is on the rise
we on these excursions so you must realize
that continually i pop my zulu
if you dont like it get off the zulu tip
so what can you do in the times which exist
you cant fake moves on your brother or your sis
but if your sis is a bitch brother is a jerk
leave em both alone and continue with your work
whatever it may be in todays society
everything is fair at least that how it seems to me
you must be honest and true to the next 
dont be phony and expect one not to flex
especially if you rhyme you have to live by the pen
your man is your man then treat him like your friend
all it is is the code of the streets 
so listen to the knowledge bein dropped over beats
beats that are hard beats that are funky
it could get you hooked like a crackhead junkie
what you gotta do to is know that the tribe is in the sphere
the abstract poet prominent like shakespeare

chorus

edgar allan poe it dont stop uh

time is running out on black power africans in the day
and white thigh supporters at night
everytime you see them theyre chasing some white woman with their tongues hangin out
time is running and passing; passing and running
running and passing; passing and running excursionsphife dawg
yo microphone check one two what is this
the five foot assassin with the roughneck business
i float like gravity never had a cavity
got more rhymes than the winans got family
no need to sweat arsenio to gain some type of fame
no shame in my game cause ill always be the same
styles upon styles upon styles is what i have
you wanna diss the phifer but you still dont know the half
i sport new balance sneakers to avoid a narrow path
messin round with this you catch the sizin of em
i never half step cause im not a half stepper
drink a lot of soda so they call me dr pepper
refuse to compete with bs competition
your name aint special ed so wont you seckle with the mission
i never walk the streets think its all about me
even though deep in my heart it really could be
i just try my best to like go all out
some might even say yo shorty black youre buggin out

q-tip
uhhh uhhh uhhh uh
zulu nation brothers thats creation
minds get flooded ejaculation
right on the two inch tape
the abstract poet incognito runs the cape
not the best not the worst and occasionally i curse to get my
point across so bust the floss
as i go in between the grit and the dirt
listen to the mission listen miss as i do work umm
as i crack the monotone
children of the jazz so get your own
smokin r&amp;b cause they try to do me
or the best of the pack but they cant do rap
for its abstract original
you cant get your own and thats pitiful
i know id be the man if i cold yanked the plug
on r&amp;b but i cant and thats bugged

buggin out buggin out buggin out youre buggin out repeat 8x

phife dawg
yo when you bug out you usually have a reason for the action
sometimes you dont its just for mere satisfaction
people be hounding always surrounding
pulsing just like a migraine pounding
you dont really fret you stay in your sense
camouflage your feeling of absolute tense
you soar off to another world deep in your mind
but people seem to take that as being unkind
oh yo hes acting stank really on a regal
a man of the fame not a man of the people
believe that if you wanna but i tell you this much
riding on the train with no dough sucks
once again a case of your feet in my nikes
if a crowd is in my realm im saying -- mic please
hip-hop is living cant yank the plug
if you do the result will end up kind of bugged

q-tip
yo i am not an invalid although i used to smoke the weed out
ali shaheed muhammad used to say i had to be out
schemin on the cookies with the crazy boomin back buns
pushin on the real hardest so we can have the big fun
when i left for rosie i was boulevard status
battling a mc was when tip was at his baddest
it was one mc after one mc
what the world could they be wanting see from little old me
do i have the formula to save the world
or was it just because i used to swipe the women and all the girls
im the type of brother with the crazy extended hand kid
dissed by all my brothers i was all up what my man did
supposed to be my man but now i wonder cause youre feeble
i go out with the strongest and i separate the evils
its your brain against my mind for those about to boot out
all you nasty critters even though you see i bug out

buggin out buggin out buggin out youre buggin out repeat 8x{q-tip}
its a fly love song

to the effect of nothing effective fronting
is what i dont allow so let me tell you something
i am a bon-a-fide
not too modest and not a lot of pride
soon to have a ride and a home to reside
if my momma is sick im by her beside
used to watch the show on channel 4 called riptide
wash my wears in-tide cause its too damn cold
out-tide thats how the runnings go
if there aint no dough then there aint no show
so take your roly poly fat promoter ass
to the chemical bank and get my cash
if you wanna see the people scream and laugh
you best quest you ask the quest you ask real fast
cause i dont wanna see em start buckin
throwin chairs in the air while you be duckin
what what  dont step to me with that
if you promotin the show make sure it aint wack

1988 senior year at garvey high
where all the guys were corny but the girls were mad fly
loungin with the tipster coolin with sha
scopin out the honeys - they know who they are
i was the b-ball playin fly rhyme sayin
fly girl gettin but never was i sweatin
cause when it came to honeys i would go on a stroll
until i met my match - her name was flo
yeah - i messed around with the one called flo
all the troopers round the way used to call her a ho
but deep down in my heart i knew that flo was good to go
cause i thought it was me - like bell biv devoe
but little did i know that she was playin with my mind
the only thing ive learned is good girls are hard to find
i feel like heavy d i need somebody for me
not someone whos mind is blank and tryin to juice me for my bank
swingin with my main man lucky behind my back
what type of crap is that - yo hows about a smack
word life i cant front - thought i was all that
but now it seems i met my match
was a stone cold lover you couldnt tell me jack
settlin down with one girl wasnt tryin to hear that
i had tonya tamika sharon karen
tina stacy julie tracy
used to love em leave em skeeze em tease em
find em lose em - also abuse em
my whole attitude was new day next hon
and believe it or not they all got done
well here comes flo with the crazy whip appeal
and im all true man like alexander oneal
is this really love then again how would i know
after all this time tryin to be a superhoe
she finally played me but yo id find another
cause i got the crazy game and yo im smooth like butter

chorus q-tip

butter like butter baby    repeat 2x
not no parkay not no margarine
strickly butter baby strictly butter

verse two phife dawg

i remember when
girls were goodie two shoes but now they turned to freaks
all of a sudden we love you phife - ease of ho my names malik
phife this phife that where you goin where you at
these girls dont know me from jack yet i feel like the mack
you didnt want me then so yo hon dont want me now
here here - take the towel wipe off your brow
and take the contact out your eye youre far from lookin fly
you get an e for effort and t for nice try
now tell me whats the reason for dyin your hair
slum village gold still danglin in your ear
you barely have a neck but still sportin a rope
four-finger ring just so phifer can scope
you looked in the mirror didnt know what to do
yesterday your eyes were brown but today they are blue
your whole appearance is a lie and it could never be true
and if you really liked yourself then you would try and be you
if your hair and eyes were real i wouldnt have dissed ya
but since it was bought i had to dismiss ya
but if you cant achieve it then why not try and weave it
if you cant extend it then you might as well suspend it
if you cant braid it best thing to do is fade it
i asked who did your hair and you tell me diane made it
if you were you and just you talk to you maybe
but i cant stand no bionic lady
tryin hard to look fly but yo youre lookin dumber
if i wanted someone like you i woulda swung with jamie summers
you wanna be treated right see father mc
or check ralph tresvant for sens-a-tiv-i-ty
see i am not the one i got more game than parker brothers
phife dog is on the mic and im smooth like butterq-tip
i had a dream about my man last night
and my man came by the studio
and his name is
busta rhymes in effect shaheed is in effect
phife did-awg is in effect 
check it out and give me my spect

im movin yes im groovin cuz my mouth is on the motor
use the coast in the mornin to avoid the funky odor
cant help bein funky im the funky abstract brotha
funky in a sense but i play the undacova
once had a fetish fetish for some booty
now im gettin funky and my rappin thats my duty
brothas tend to jock on the style in particular
if you got the ego like some brothas then ill get with ya
but if i dont pursue then i just dont give a fuck
my motto in the 90s is be happy makin bucks
girls love the jim cuz it causes crazy friction
when it goes up in and fluctuates the diction
i still understand the uh cuz thats what i met her for
im hooked on the swings so just call me the music whore
women love the voice brothas dig the lyrics
quest the peoples choice we thrive it for the spirit
if you cant hear it then get the wax utensils
write my rhymes straight up dont get with no fancy stencil
the rhymes we get is sweet we stay away from tart
a perfectionist at work perkin up the art
if you want to battle i suggest you check your clock
your demise is comin up and i want your man to watch
be the prime example i deep instilled the sample
insignificance here ill place you on the mantle
born up in harlem reside down in jamaica
the girl i used to rock her moms was a claker
now what does that make her the evil money taker
the crazy move faker i used that to break her

vinia mojica singing in the background
phife is in the house uncle mike is in the house
bob power is in the house tim latham is in the house
wise men is in the house the brand nubes is in the house
the jay bee they in the house and de la they in the house

i must regroup my thoughts and kick the next ones for my people
please dont be deceived by ugly slice of evil
the world is kinda cold and the rhythm is my blanket
wrap yourself up in it if you love it then youll thank it
dont move to rebuttal wave your hand for action
some women in the 90s want more than satisfaction
they want keys and gs and all those illy things
if you want to ill show you just what the ab can bring
i keep a tight net with my brothas ken and kenny 
if the question is of rhymes then ill tell ya i got plenty
the thing that men and women need to do is stick together
progressions cant be made if were separate forever
i hooked this funky beat with the loop and the feature
is the funky singin by miss vinia mojica
so listen because the quest is led through the underground
my people have been oppressed too long no more will we be down
people tend to riff cuz they dont know the mental
people tend to bug cuz their beats are hard but gentle
afro kinda lurks through the body of this youngun
play like bobby byrd on your back and your comin to 
the house of the jazz of the funk of the rhythm
all the goods are welcome but if youre a villain
ill just wait and debate contemplate your arrival
if flexin is your motive then you dont like survival
the abstract is speakin the hard beats is reachin
the black and puerto ricans
cuz their butt naked streakin through the ever murky streets 
of the urbanized areas
blastin out the speakers is the hip hop hysteria

craig is in the house pete rock is in the house
cl is in the house ultra mag is in the house
nice and smooth is in the house big daddy kane is in the house
beatnuts is in the house special ed is in the house

yeah *7x*
this one goes out to my man
thanks a lot ron carter on the bass
yes my man ron carter is on the bass
now check it out
born into the 91 decade
you gotta say the quest is on
and goddamn it yes the quest is on
and we outverse 1

q-tip

let me tell you bout the snakes the fakes the lies
the highs at all of these industry shing-dings
where you see the pretty girls
in the high animated world
checkin for a rapper with all the dough
if you take a shit they want to know
and if youre gonna fall they wont be around yall
so you still wanna do the show business
and you think that you got what it takes
i mean you really gotta rap and be all that
and prepare yourself for the breaks
check it out

do you wanna be in the business the business
the ups and downs with the hoes the business
always gettin fronted on at shows the business
people gotta stick their nose in the business

verse 2

q-tip

yo i gotta speak on the cesspool
its the rap industry and it aint that cool
only if youre on stage but if youre speakin to your people
aint no-one your equal
especially on the industry side
dont let the games just glide
right through your fingers you gotta know the deal
so lord jamar speak because youre real

lord jamar

theyre givin you the business and puttin on a show
youre a million dollar man that aint got no dough
but you got a ho tickets backstage to a show
sedated and at that fact they elated
time pass and your ass say wheres my loot
the reply is a kick in the ass from a leg and a boot
all you wanna do is taste the fruit
but in the back theyre makin fruit juice
you ask for slack and wanna get cut loose from the label
not able cuz you signed at the table
for a pretty cash advance now they got a song and dance
that you didnt recoup more soup wit ya meal
cos this is the real when you get a record deal
and i say

phife

awshucks look what the cat hauled in
its phife dawg from a tribe called quest let me begin
like chuck d i got so much trouble on my mind
bout these no-talent artists gettin signed they cant rhyme
and if that aint bad you got bootleggers
goin out like suckers motherfuckers
feel its time that i let loose the lion
and if not that then ill commence to head flyin
seems in 91 everybody want a rhyme
and then you go and sell my tape for only $599
please nigga ive worked too hard for this
no more will i take the booty end of the stick
bogus brothers makin albums when they know they cant hack it
cuz they lyrics is played like 8-ball jackets
now tell me i cant tear it up
go get yourself some toilet paper cuz your lyrics is butt

do you wanna be in the business the business
people cant walk a straight line in the business
some of these brothers cant rhyme in the business
a-yo im tryna get mine the business

verse 3

sadat x

the party scene is cool but then again its all the same
you see the same faces but at different places
when youre up and ridin high everything is palsy-palsy
get a million pounds and all the skins give you hugs
well thats cool i can dig it it really aint my bag
prefer to max on the side and let my pants sag
oh hes a cutie yeah real cute
but i wasnt that cute when i didnt have no loot
although i hit a pound of herbs im still nice with the verbs
so fuck what you heard
the born cipher cipher master makes me think much faster
but critics still continue to plaster
my name and discredit my fame
all that shit is game
and i dont really give a damn
eat from the tree of life and throw away the verbal ham

diamond d

well excuse me i gotta add my two cents in
dont be alarmed the rhyme was condensed in
a matter of minutes so it must be told
all that glitters not gold
everybody wants a deal help me make a demo
see my name in bright lights ride around in a limo
my moms keeps beefin boy get a job
but i wanna make jams damn i know ill slam
huh well its not that easy
you gotta get a label thats willin and able
to market and promote and you better hope
for what that the product is dope
take it from diamond its like mountain climbin
when it comes to rhymin you gotta put your time in
get a good lawyer so problems wont pile
you dont wanna make a pitch thats wildq-tip

let me flaunt the style style i think that the times near
that we drop studs studs there will be no duds here
rappers play the dumb dumb kinda on the space tip
but when they hear the jams jams they be on the dilsnick
now im not for the rock rock i know the territory
go ahead and try try thats a different story
similar to grimm grimm i can tell a better one
all about a kid kid who couldnt rap and didnt run
stand stand aside aside when the rap is gettin dumb
resort to baggin billy billy askin can he have some
no never ever ever come back and try again man
if you come back back ill be the first to shake your hand
competitions good good it brings out the vital parts
the abstract poetic etic majors in recital arts
do it for the kids kids the elders and the rap peers
we know the job is done done when we hear a lot of cheers
gotta feel the vibes vibes come from my creation
if the hands clap clap im filled with elation
here i am ghetto full with a lot of steam
think i gotta i think i gotta i think i gotta scream scream
cuz thats how good it feels child
let your hair down down so we can get buckwild
do your ill dance dance dont think about the next man
we must have unity and think of the bigger plan
division we will fall fall we must stick together see
id like to take this time time to say whats up to kool g
the name is q-tip tip the midnight marauder
give enough respect spect to afrika bambaataa
as a man in the world world i must do my job
take care of mama duke duke i wont resort to rob
bob youll get your dough dough mase is my witness
obsessed with the rap rap for its the mental fitness
like shootin cee-lo lo and always gettin headcracks
the industry is luck luck winning with the fake raps
peace to the crews crews who pump the real hip hop
not sellin out out from hardrock to disc jock
from disc jock to hardrock from hardrock to disc jock

phife

i dont know what to say but here i go freak it
if the papes come then you know ill seek it
im just a short brotha dark skin face
weigh a buck-fifty 36 waist
my hair is crazy curly
front like mr furley
to this day i still believe that no mc can serve me
brothas try to front but everybody know know
i get more props than the arsenio hall show
party animal i was but now i chill at home

classic example of aa date rape4x

q-tip
listen to the rhyme its a black date fact
percentile rate of date rape is fat
this is all true to the reason of the skeezin
you got the right pickin but youre in the wrong season
if youre in the wrong season that means you gotta break
especially if a squad tries to cry out rape
you be all vexed cuz she got it goin on 
you dont wanna fight cuz you know that youre wrong
so instead you rest your head on the arm of the couch
envision in your head of a great sex bout
worthy opponent all you wanna do is bone it
you ask can you kick it she says you cant stick it
this is the case the situation is sticky
should you try to kiss or head towards a hickey
not even you can ask steven
if the vibe aint right huh ya leavin
hit the road jack and all of that
but if she offers her abode to drop ya load
right smack dab in the middle
get the kitten i got crazy tender vittles

phife
uh huh you know science you get buckwild
runnin mad games as if your name was scott skiles
or better yet magic or even karl malone
regardless who it is your aim is to bone
if she tries to front then you start to dis her
if shes with the program thats when you start to kiss her
might as well get to the point no time to waste
might as well break the ice then set the pace
you start to talk nasty now shes ready to bone
step out of the shower throw on cologne
all of a sudden her sugarwalls tumble down like jericho
shes hotter than meshach shadrach and abendego
you listen to after 7 break fool after 10
do your thing at 12 oclock and when you go again
there goes round 1 ding there goes round two
now tell me what the fuck are you supposed to do
what do you know when the meow is completed
girly girl cried rape yo i didnt really need it

q-tip
sweetheart we aint goin out like that2x
sweetheart we aint goin out like thatzulu
we aint goin out like thatzulu
we aint goin out like that

now baby bust it if you wanna groove
me and you can do it it will be the move
i wont cry over spilled milk
if you wont let me take you to the hilt
i dont wanna bone you that much
that i would go for the unforbidden touch
im not the type that would go for that
ill have to fetch a brand new cat
baby baby baby i dont wanna be rude
i know because of your bloody attitude
i know why you act that way
it usually happens on the 28th day
i respect that crazily
when youre done with the past can you come check me

okay if knowledge is the key then just show me the lock
got the scrawny legs but i move just like lou brock
with speed  im agile plus im worth your while
one hundred percent intelligent black child
my optic presentation sizzles the retina
how far must i go to gain respect um
well its kind of simple just remain your own
or youll be crazy sad and alone
industry rule number four thousand and eighty
record company people are shady
so kids watch your back cause i think they smoke crack
i dont doubt it  look at how they act
off to better things like a hip-hop forum
pass me the rock and ill storm with the crew and
proper  what you say hammer proper
rap is not pop if you call it that then stop

lookin at miss lane it was the fast lane
barely knows her name struck by fame
she just got a benz she rides with her friends
gotta keep her beeper in her purse to make ends
rollin down the block checkin out the spots
she winks at the cops always give her props
she knows shes the woman cant nobody touch her
hangs out for the loot makes her papes from the gutter
tried to make my moves on miss lane she called me young boy
told her not to dis me i just want to be your love toy
you young boy my love toy i doubt that very highly
just because you rhyme dont mean ill let you try me
business oriented egos never dented
always sweet scented if its business she meant it
distractions never hurt always did the work
always was alert she never got jerked 
queen of the feats thrive to compete
love the funky beats while she drive down the street
she was justified couldnt get a job
had to feed her family so she had to play then rob
pullin out the ooh wop listenin to doo-wop
you dont have to say a word
gunshotsthats all ya heard

chorus4x

shes not a big kahuna wish i met her sooner
instead i met her later my love is much greater
put me on her roster to rid her of imposters
and to sell the buddah for the sexy drug ruler
love is my motive now im drug promotive
plus i needed duckets to fill up my buckets
supplied me with the squeezy to make my life easy
now im missing action for this fatal attraction
but dont you let me catch you with your joint up in these bitches
and dont you even dare to plan a plot upon my riches
cuz if you play me out i think ill let ya be
ill be damned if i let a brotha try to gas me
i played my cards well try to live swell
for the g i would sell cuz i was deep in hell
but then i really wasnt she had a fly cousin
who would give me booty on the side of my cutie
elaine she kinda new that i would do the do
but she didnt tear i did my work with care
thats all that really mattered he money never splattered
as long as she was paid she was in the shade
you cant really blame her for holdin on a flamer
society taught her but they didnt tame her
a ten clip salute hunny heres a troop
she will never stop until she reach the top
top top[chorus]
weve got the jazz 8x

[verse 1 q-tip]
stern firm and young with a laid-back tongue
the aim is to succeed and achieve at 21
just like ringling brothers ill daze and astound
captivate the mass cause the prose is profound

do it for the strong we do it for the meek
boom it in your boom it in your boom it in your jeep
or your honda or your beemer or your legend or your benz
the rave of the town to your foes and your friends

so push it along trails we blaze
dont deserve the gong dont deserve the praise
the tranquility will make ya unball your fist
for we put hip-hop on a brand new twist

a brand new twist with the homie-alistic
so low-key that ya probably missed it
and yet its so loud that it stands in the crowd
when the guy takes the beat they bowed

so raise up squire adjust your attire
we have no time to wallow in the mire
if youre on a foreign path then let me do the lead
join in the essence of the cool-out breed

then cool out to the music cuz it makes ya feel serene
like the birds and the bees and all those groovy things
like getting stomach aches when ya gotta go to work
or staring into space when ya feelin berserk

i dont really mind if its over your head
cuz the job of resurrectors is to wake up the dead
so pay attention its not hard to decipher
and after the horns you can check out the phifer

[chorus]

[verse two phife]
competition dem phifer come sideway
but competition dey mus me come straightway
competition dem phifer come sideway
but competition dey mus me come straightway

hows about that it seems like its my turn again
all through the years my mike has been my best friend
i know some brothers wonder can phifer really kick it
some even wanna dis me but why sweat it

im all into my music cuz its how i make papes
tryin to make hits like kid capri mix tapes
me sweat another  i do my own thing
strictly hardcore tracks not a new jack swing

i grew up as a christian so to jah i give thanks
collect my banks listen to shabba ranks
i sing and chat i do all of that
its 1991 and i refuse to come wack

i take off my hat to other crews that intend to rock
but the low end theorys here its time to wreck shop
i got tip and shah so whom shall i fear
stop look and listen but please dont stare

so jet to the store and buy the lp
on jive/rca cassettes and cds
produced and arranged by the four-man crew
and oh shit skeff anslem he gets props too

make sure you have a system with some phat house speakers
so the new shit can rock from mars to massapequot
cuz where i come from quality is job one
and everybody up on linden know we get the job done

so peace to that crew and peace to this crew
bring on the tour well see you at a theatre nearest you

[verse three q-tip]
hey yo but wait back it up huh easy back it up

back and forth just like a cameo song
if you dig this joint then please come dance along
to the music cuz its done just for the rhyme
now i gotta scat and get mine underlined

the jazz the what  the jazz to move that ass
cuz the tribe originates that feelin of pizzazz
its the universal sound best to brothers on the ground
and the ones six below ya didnt have to go

some say that im a sinner cuz i once had an orgy
and sometimes for breakfast i eat grits and porgies
if this is a stinker then call me a stink i ask

okay
i am recognizing that the voice inside my head
is urging me to be myself but never follow someone else
because opinions are like voices
we all have a different kind
so just clean out all of your ears
these are my views and you will find that
we revolutionize over the kick and the snare
the ghetto vocalist is on a state-wide tear
soon to be the continent and then the freakin globe
theres room for it all as we mingle at the ball
we welcome competion cuz it doesnt make one lazy or worn
we gotta work hard you know the damn card

try to be the fattest also to stay alivechorus dove - de la soul

the night is my mind
the sunll still shine
but the night is on my mind
so parlay while i drop this rhyme

see jake be gettin illy when the sun get dark
they be comin out the heads but shit dont let me start
their activities are plenty in nighttimenighttime
for the ghetto child it seems to be the right time
see kids be gettin stuck with jewels and fly gimmicks
shorty see the action and then start to mimic
runnin to the corner the dice game is blazin
lookin at the loot it seems so amazin
puts it short down to be exact would bound
he shakes the stones in his hand then he lets it downuh
scam money dont make none
he threw a trip on the ace now hes out son
hits the local bodega to woof down a hero
son is on a midnight run like de niro
spots the shorty rock standin on his block
the thieves be handlin in the pumpsso he asked it its not
conversation that he kicked to the shorty was a sly one
increased intensity his dance sure was a fly one
took her to the crib there she ran her gibs
about mind upliftment and bein positive
he yawned and he sighed til 105
then he finally realized that hunny wasnt live
at least he didnt plan on buildin for the evenin
threw the fila on the dome and said come on yo we leavin
came out on the scene as he told her to beep him
saw his man sam with the blunt in his hand
aww shhhyou know the transaction
brothas gettin lost in the weed satisfaction
comin down the block man loud as fuck
you would swear redman was inside the trunk 
as the night seemed darker cops is on a hunt
they interrupt ya cipher and crush ya blunt
see you left your work at home so they pat you down for nuthin
why in the hell does 10-4 keep frontin
you push to the park even though its still dark
the kid is nice on the hoop he said ill spot ya troop

the night is on my mind 
the sunll still shine 
but now the night is on my mind the night is on the mind
the night is on your mind 
a yo the sunll still shine
but now the night is on the mind
as for me

im a nocturnal animal god concentrates
on a young black man who makes the niggaz speak a shake
the nighttime is busy its word to aunt kizzy
its the time we get down yo son you know the sound
the flavas on the top with the rugged beat to back it
the night makes the aura and the j cant hack it
the way the moon dangles in the midnight sky
and the stars dance around a yo i think its fly
intensity most rappers dont see it
spirit wise musically you gotta be it
serenity and sirens of the sounds and emotions
in the concrete jungle and the sun dont bungle
i think its hard to find the words on how i feel
i paid about a deuce twenty for the ampex steel
but let me slow down i think i ran my gibs enough
peace out to the nation stay rugged and rough

the night is on my mind the sunll still shine
the night is on my mind the night is on my mind
the night is on my mind yeah the sunll still shine
but now uh huh the night is on my mind
the night is on your mind you know the sunll still shine

phife
im not your average mc with the joe schmoe flow
if you dont know me by now youll never know
steppin on my critics beatin on my foes
the plan is to stay focused only then i can go
straight from the heart i represent hip hop
i be three albums deep but i dont wanna go pop
too many candy rappers seem to be at the top
too much candy is no good so now im closin the shop
crushin competition like your tires on grapes
my rhymes styles be blendin like a ron g tape
my man where ya goin you cant escape
when the tribe is in the house that means nobody is safe
how can a reverend preach when a rev cant define
the music of our youth from 1979
we rap about what we see meaning reality
from people bustin caps and like mandela bein free
not every mc be with the negativity
we have a slew of rappers pushin positivity
hip hop will never die yo its all about the rap
so marion barry smokin crack lets preach about that
the trash you talk wont matter that old bogus chatter
the more that you condemn us it only makes us phatter
when i talk i know im talkin for you poppers all around
you know you love the sound we gets down

chorus

q-tip
im the cherry on the top of yo ice cream
im the wish you thought inside your dream
listen to the way we pulsate the jam
im the nigga here with the mic in hand
styles that we present are just a few
to do away with you and your hum drum crew
this is 93 and the shit is real
black people unite and put down your steel
ladies make a forum on your sexual drive
devoted to your lover and make it thrive
the riff was of f im a hip hop body
release the energy like the force of a shotty
standin on the wall with my polo on
talkin to the girl with the liz claiborne
keep the poetry in my black knapsack
got my timbo horse and my doublemint pack
hit the city streets to enhance my soul
i can kick a rhyme over ill drum rolls
with a kick snare kicks and high hat
skilled in the trade of that old boom bap
i can do a trick with the opposite breed
i used to down 40s and smoke grain weed
now im doin shows with half loot down
now its time for me to take ya uptown

its like that man its like that yes 7x
its like this shaheed

verse one q-tip phife dawg

honey check it out you got me mesmerized

street poetry is my everyday

if i was workin at the club you would not pay
aiyyo my man phife diggy he got somthin to say

i like em brown yellow puero rican or hatian
name is phife dawg from the zulu nation
told you in the jam that we can get down
now lets knock the boots like the group h-town
you got bbd all on your bedroom wall
but im above the rim and this is how i ball
a pretty little somethin on the new york street
this is how i represent over this here beat
talkin bout you

yo i took you out
but sex was on my mind for the whole damn route
my mind was in a frenzy and a horny state
but i couldnt drop dimes cause *you couldnt relate*

chorus

verse two q-tip phife dawg

stretch out your legs let me make you bawl
drive you insane drive you up the wall
starin at your dome-piece very strong
stronger than pride stronger than teflon
take you on the ave and you buy me links
now i wanna pound the putang until it stinks
you can be my mama and ill be your boy

original rude boy never am i coy
you can be a shorty in my ill convoy
not to come across as a thug or a hood
but hon you got the goods like madeline woods
by the way my names malik
the five-foot freak
lets say we get together by the end of the week
she simply said no labelled me a hoe
i said how you figure  my friends told me so
i hate when silly groupies wanna run they yap
word to god hon i dont get down like that

ill have you weak in the knees that you could hardly speak
or we could do like uncle l and swing an ep in my jeep
keep it in the down yo we keep it discrete
see im not the type to kid to have my biz in the streets

if my mom dont approve then ill just elope
let me sink the little man from inside the boat
let me hit it from the back girl i wont catch a hernia
bust off on your couch now you got seamens furniture

shaheed phife and the extra p
stacy  dj and my man lg

choruschorus

chorus

if you venture up the wrong road then the circumstance
will be crucial i got hundreds of rhymes thatll suit you
so listen
the abstract intuition is very very worthy
i can feel ya out from russia to jersey

the low the nikes the links the jeeps
the women the lingo and all the other goods
peace to the hoods that keep my shit on play
please dont do the mute when you hear me on the juke
brothas know my angle its the star-spangled black banner

if want a roll then dough i be rakin
the scope is on the world cuz its mine for the takin

chemists get confused of my ill composition

then i came back and just fucked up his head
cuz yo he thought an mc who was seen on tv

to bless her ass uptown real mcs will hold it down
yea yea sonny to the beat like that

verse two phife dawg

yes dread i had a similiar situation
when this kid tried to tell me i didnt deserve my occupation
he said i wasnt shit that i was soon to fall
i looked him up and down grab my crotch and said balls
of course he tried to bring it on the battling tip
ay you know me you know i had to come out my shit
trying to lounge at the mall meet skef and mr walton
finally i banged his ass wit the verbal assault
he said a rhyme about his 45 and his nickelbags of weed
thats when i preceeded to give him what he needed
talking bout i need a phillie right before i get loose
poor excuse money please i get loose off of orange juice
preferly minute maid cuz thats exactly what it takes
to write a rhyme huh to school your nickels and your dimes
because an mc like me be on tv
dont mean i cant hold my shit down in nyc

phony rappers who do not write
phony rappers who do not excite
phony rappers you know they type
phony rappers check it

verse three phife consequence

it seems theres a sanitation yard full of trash talkers
sounding good but money can you feed the dog hawker
talking bout your mic days and your breakdancing
not enhancing you sound tired
oh shit i didnt know you like to play yourself in frontcha friends
sitting there lying to no end
mcs for me make things happening
talk about a world but in a form of rapping
who will be the captain of this ship
if it goes down dont you know you have to go wit it
just because you rhyme for a couple of weeks
doesnt mean that youve reach the mcs peak
let me stop sounding all bitter
ghetto child never be a quitter
but dont be a phony in the litter
take it as a letter from the better
take it from a man who used to rhyme in busted ass jettas

c yo phife you need a condom
p word to god mess around
i catch aids from mcs being on my nuts too hard
c  cuz on my blvd you better bring your bodyguard
p  and whats your blvd
c  lb i represent naturally

the deadly venom let me start from the beginning
we always hittin so yo therell be no extra innings
as i send the mic out the park like reggie jackson
you be the minor leaguer who sees no action
the coming attractionwhat
the main feature
and im a greet ya like a rhymin ass creature
lurking all up in the dark unknown parts
the brotha well prepared is the brotha who will start
and thats me aqui as long as the ladies move they bodies
well have a forum to stand
cuz that happens to be the nature of man
sexuality it is the format baby
aint no ifs no buts no ands or maybes
but i praise lord in the worlds thats unseen
respect me for that and let me do my thingjust
i said respect me for that and let me do my thing

chorus
drifting byyou know we gotta get a hold
suddenly over the illest drum rolls
suddenly drifting by just

yo how you doin let me give you an intro
my names the abstract now let me give you some info 
got the diamond in the back and the sunroof shit
that makes the hardcore mcs resort to being bitch
and i dont give a shit about being wild rich
just make me comfortable and ill deal with it
your lust for the riches make a nigga feel sick
down to his zealots upchuck and then spit
denouncin my beliefs well then your wig get split
lay your ego on the ground so that youll benefit
you can take these words and relay it to your click
take some time for your mind and get off them head trips
dont try to play me see my names not dick
the tribe is the crew that makes your mics get lit
like the fourth of july on some firework shit
my record company be on some  true jerk shit
but thats i-ight now im on some true work shit
and ima make it happen for my whole outfit

chorus

suddenlyover the illest drum rolls
suddenly drifting by justthird verse

a-yo we just gettin started
got to redirect this vision
got the beauty of a flower
plus dimensions like a prism 
your minds are locked down like prison
yall really need to go lay down
cuz positivity has risen
we hittin
yo bust how we too strong to be broken
occasional malfunction pressure time
we aint jokin
for security we on this run like logan
kamaals doin the hustle
and you backstage voguin
we all got flaws
dont ever try to think that you perfect
we all are human beings 
theres bullshit at the surface 
sometimes i mean we rhyme 
damn we aint prophets
and if you think so you need to stop it
so jump back inside your shell
let your million dollar thoughts propel
but next man dont get jel
playa hate that all carries weight 
that we dont need
we slim with disabilities and
thick with possibilities
cuz then you cant move with agility
navigatin with good visibility
we put these tunes out in record shop facilities
lets strive to get this constant money activity
we try to stay on the scene like fidel
so if you get enraged with these names it still rebels
there aint no plan bs 
yo watch we movin through with plan a
money market doin things the right way

in this american metropolis filled with mcs
a tribe called quest came to drop jewels wit ease
plus make you party we do this music thing for everybody
black white latino and asian we cold raisin
the stakes of hip-hop to a new plateau
to bridge gaps in generations for future plantations
a god-fearin folk cos we all from the yolk
of one breed one seed to good goals we proceed
nowadays i strive to be a very good influence
even though not too long ago i was a truant
now im droppin it on this and many broad topics
from mans obsession with money to holy prophets
like mohammed yo you know the scene is so freaky
enemies they denounce me and my own try to sweep me
now i got hip-hop acts posin like fat cats
lex and a rolex moet and a top hat
but what about your contract slick is you proper
its time we turned the tables of this hip-hop fable
i be strivin yo tryna bang these joints out my skillet
and fulfil it think about these kids we cant kill it

phife

wit your simpleton lyrics your light-hearted act

while light and sha they represent bk to the fullest

my style is great ask your peoples can i dominate
my rhymes are harder than last nights erection

my shit is lovely simply meaning that my joint is tight
amping up the mic making sure productions tight
sometimes i might catch a severe case of writers block
but by the end of the day youll be on my jock
my names malik my hobbys putting mcs to the test
and if you front ill put my foot up in your friggin chest
freestyle fanatic and never will it ever stop
you crew is loose you might just want to call the cops
aiyyo i gotta put some action on paper
make sure my verse jump up and spread out like the raper
the only tip i got for a waiter
is watch the doorknob hit me where the dirty dog shoulda bit me
that was my train of thought but for so long i fought
now im at a level supreme to the devil
so turn up the bass and lay low on the treble

verse two q-tip phife
yo ive been treading on this globe man for twenty-five joints

cause toniiiiight we gettin off like oj
and yo i got a dawg that bites fuck the barking
yo i got a crew with the beats and the smarts and
i fought my shit up on linden in the one-nine-two
forever writing never biting aint shit else to do
hoping to battle but most mcs aint ready yet
but if they huddle and word then this is good as set
you have mcs dropping bombs thats incredible
some of the brothers their styles are just despicable
as for me see i just do how i love to do
try to deny me of my props then ill be seeing you
most of you suckers wanna be down for the tag along
the friggin fame someone tell em that this shit aint games
you gots to do this from your heart meaning your inner soul
and if its real only then will you be on a roll
i try to stay on top my game there aint no time to lose
four albums deep as a quester but still we payin dues
so hear me out one time you gots ta be yourself
cuz if you aint yourself you end up by your friggin self
im coming rugged with the linden boule type of slang
and yo well see who can hang yo

sometimes men and women look at themselves and see bliss
through experience we tend to exist
thats through our past or our caretakers
the instance is in particular so you need to recognize that
if you take all this away
and look at us at the end of the day
we stand great among creation
so baby take these words as a little inspiration
while i kick this shit get your ass motivation
mcs youre walking a thin line
get in your ranks and tighten up as we walk through mines
and plus vipers phony rhymers and biters
money-grubbers beat-dubbers
amongst a whole host of others

waitin for your bacon
they be takin and skatin while you sit contemplatin
whos your peoples

and if you cross the path then you dangerin your jaw
and if you glass joe dont go toe-for-toe

so brothers hold your heads high when you get down
dont violate these women cuz we need them around
its all of us together not the one without the other
the abstract is ill word to mother

yo use your body maker and use your minds to break true
yo we gotta do the do

about the lands we boast but we dont own jack
how the fuck we movin through makin moves like that
how the hell we movin through makin moves like that
can you explain that i doubt that very highly
we got jewels and mo and the life is tight rowdy

a few of my brothas did that asshole one time
strivin miss sunrise sometimes is known as crime
the three twenty-five got that windex shine
and when i shot skelly i had my boxes in lines
all i wanna do is live life and be fair
i used to stress girls with long legs and long hair
now i want a woman with a spiritual flair
god will never make it too hard for me to bare
im hungry like a derelict whose stays in the diluse
some can count me out but yo i doubt that i lose
the westernized world got our minds confused
you frontin on me ak then you dont get bruised
the funny style cats they be playin games like chucky
government officials shoot their same old
made of devil agents a k a the devil flunky
stiff ass squares gettin mad cuz we funky
this the crap game then we got the top rolls
the positive jumps the negative like frogs
resentin evil vibes yo that shit is at the morgue
we celebrate laughin down in at the smorgas borg
you still lookin shitty like a to down committee
lets make this institution buy the land for the smitties
i got girls with tails plenty smarts and big titties
and they all stressin me really

q-tip
yo i know the feelin when you feelin like a villain

all adversities so we can get through fast like that

chorus

verse two
consequence

tried to rise to the top you just couldnt recover
and all i want is my laceration of the pie
to get this whip cream before the water runs dry

chris tucker joke passed inside of my head
put the thought away think of you instead

the church of scientology feminine biology
manic depressive psychologically add alive and we
polluted by technology the fumes and its ecology
while your thought you was out of copy i get nastier than sodomy

was the degree of the economy that do the sovereignty
regarded as a prodigy leery in sociology
let the wallabees always conceal my gynecology
rhymin pathologically thats how it gotta be
never makin no apology worshippin my anthropology
fuck modesty studyin microbiology
causin verbal lobotomy its in my geneology
six months of sobriety movin very methodically
like a unicorn more ways than oceanography
guard technology rip shows antibiotically
true thugs bionically give birth to criminology

[words]
yo as a youngin i swear to god you couldnt tell me nothin
i swore i was gettin somethin clothes or humpin
for girls with the church slacks with some shirts tucked in

but now when im clubbin those that used to dis were buggin
overweight chicks spandex they stomachs sucked in

told people you got in free when you really snuck in

[q-tip]
we never get concerned about whos in the league
we just stay workin so no one will need
an unconcerned outsider givin niggaz feed
my niggaz puff weed but negotiate the seed
the family is granite and you cant intercede
i try to switch lanes at this operatin speed
cats in the game be gamblin with greed
we the house you the player and we gonna catch these
whos the sam sneed makin microphones bleed
poker face creed while my mind just read
shorty got rhythm but her freak got freed
thats insignificant but this take heed

and if you think im a dope then ask the other crew 
and i proceed to let you know exactly how to flow 
im not lawn doctor so just step off with the hoe 
oops my mistake i didnt know you went with her 
should i run down the line of the all the kids that done hit her 
dont be bitter i hear that honey resembles a critter 
i heard she likes to do one-one my man john ritter 
but back to the subject you cant catch wreck 
you must get respect to earn respect 
suckers think they could herb me cuz know i wear specks 
youre full of jokes but you your name aint flex 
i got the riches the bitches im large like a huxtable 
you think youre all that but youre girls quite doable 
yeah im tellin you g to back up off me 
im not a mad cohort but im not mr softee 
rappin is an art coming straight from the heart 
so forget the chart because the action can start 

chorus 

verse two q-tip 

where ya at to all my peoples with the funk 
im the undercover brother dump your hoe in the trunk 
save all the sad songs and the tearjerkers 
niggaz step back its the lyrical worker 
the poems that i create aint in paper back books 
the poems that i create are for hookers and the crooks 
my mental is excelling cuz i dabble in the books 
im not the one to front on so suboops-suboops 
yo i gets the pickens im such a damn dickens 
if you step to this then the plot just thickens 
ill run you around the track like a bunny and a dog 
to me your just another mc on the log 
a link on the chain fluid on the brain 
i boast of hype lyrics and yours are mundane 
see i cant maintain especially if you come back 
im the lyrical master blaster yeah i can do that 
i can also do your girl so leave the hoe at home 
cuz when i get done ill have her strung on bones 
its the no-joke pressure that elevates my mind 
makes me pick up and go when its time to drop my rhymes 
my title is locked the abstract poetic 
im in the idle mode but my energys kinetic 
so smooth and debonair especially for the ear 
gotta keep my thing in gear cuz its evident and clear 
that i will rock rock rock fades away 

choruschorus q-tip

[verse 1 q-tip]
stern firm and young with a laid-back tongue
the aim is to succeed and achieve at 21
just like ringling brothers ill daze and astound
captivate the mass cause the prose is profound

do it for the strong we do it for the meek
boom it in your boom it in your boom it in your jeep
or your honda or your beemer or your legend or your benz
the rave of the town to your foes and your friends

so push it along trails we blaze
dont deserve the gong dont deserve the praise
the tranquility will make ya unball your fist
for we put hip-hop on a brand new twist

a brand new twist with the homie-alistic
so low-key that ya probably missed it
and yet its so loud that it stands in the crowd
when the guy takes the beat they bowed

so raise up squire adjust your attire
we have no time to wallow in the mire
if youre on a foreign path then let me do the lead
join in the essence of the cool-out breed

then cool out to the music cuz it makes ya feel serene
like the birds and the bees and all those groovy things
like getting stomach aches when ya gotta go to work
or staring into space when ya feelin berserk

i dont really mind if its over your head
cuz the job of resurrectors is to wake up the dead
so pay attention its not hard to decipher
and after the horns you can check out the phifer

[chorus]

[verse two phife]
competition dem phifer come sideway
but competition dey mus me come straightway
competition dem phifer come sideway
but competition dey mus me come straightway

hows about that it seems like its my turn again
all through the years my mike has been my best friend
i know some brothers wonder can phifer really kick it
some even wanna dis me but why sweat it

im all into my music cuz its how i make papes
tryin to make hits like kid capri mix tapes
me sweat another  i do my own thing
strictly hardcore tracks not a new jack swing

i grew up as a christian so to jah i give thanks
collect my banks listen to shabba ranks
i sing and chat i do all of that
its 1991 and i refuse to come wack

i take off my hat to other crews that intend to rock
but the low end theorys here its time to wreck shop
i got tip and shah so whom shall i fear
stop look and listen but please dont stare

so jet to the store and buy the lp
on jive/rca cassettes and cds
produced and arranged by the four-man crew

you wanna diss the phifer but you still dont know the half
i sport new balance sneakers to avoid a narrow path
messin round with this you catch the sizin of em
i never half step cause im not a half stepper
drink a lot of soda so they call me dr pepper
refuse to compete with bs competition
your name aint special ed so wont you seckle with the mission
i never walk the streets think its all about me
even though deep in my heart it really could be
i just try my best to like go all out
some might even say yo shorty black youre buggin out

q-tip
uhhh uhhh uhhh uh
zulu nation brothers thats creation
minds get flooded ejaculation
right on the two inch tape
the abstract poet incognito runs the cape
not the best not the worst and occasionally i curse to get my
point across so bust the floss
as i go in between the grit and the dirt
listen to the mission listen miss as i do work umm
as i crack the monotone
children of the jazz so get your own
smokin r&amp;b cause they try to do me
or the best of the pack but they cant do rap
for its abstract original
you cant get your own and thats pitiful
i know id be the man if i cold yanked the plug
on r&amp;b but i cant and thats bugged

buggin out buggin out buggin out youre buggin out repeat 8x

phife dawg
yo when you bug out you usually have a reason for the action
sometimes you dont its just for mere satisfaction
people be hounding always surrounding
pulsing just like a migraine pounding
you dont really fret you stay in your sense
camouflage your feeling of absolute tense
you soar off to another world deep in your mind
but people seem to take that as being unkind
oh yo hes acting stank really on a regal
a man of the fame not a man of the people
believe that if you wanna but i tell you this much
riding on the train with no dough sucks
once again a case of your feet in my nikes
if a crowd is in my realm im saying -- mic please
hip-hop is living cant yank the plug
if you do the result will end up kind of bugged

q-tip
yo i am not an invalid although i used to smoke the weed out
ali shaheed muhammad used to say i had to be out
schemin on the cookies with the crazy boomin back buns
pushin on the real hardest so we can have the big fun
when i left for rosie i was boulevard status
battling a mc was when tip was at his baddest
it was one mc after one mc
what the world could they be wanting see from little old me
do i have the formula to save the world
or was it just because i used to swipe the women and all the girls
im the type of brother with the crazy extended hand kid
dissed by all my brothers i was all up what my man did
supposed to be my man but now i wonder cause youre feeble
i go out with the strongest and i separate the evils
its your brain against my mind for those about to boot out
all you nasty critters even though you see i bug out

buggin out buggin out buggin out youre buggin out repeat 8xuhhhhhhhh
the lord giveth and the lord taketh away
but not hip-hop yo hahah
and let it be known that we are on some umm

and this aint on the pop tip yo
are yall kids tucked in yeah
here we go

people in the audience they cry out hoe
people with a gun yo theyll cry out bo
i dont like a cop i dont sell a rock
but still the kangas clock me after a show
standin on the stage and were pourin with sweat
to people in the crowd i give what they get
papers make paid babies make laid
i dont really worry nor do i fret
waitin for the gimme and boy i got some
sweat like a peach and tart like a plum
i thought what i think i rock a bead-link
legally ill sip when i turn twenty-one
a letter to the homeboy that freaked the head dome
the army wants me to drop my microphone
gotta be brief; no orders from a chief
hot butter on what say what the popcorn
on the tour bus we hit the truck stop
a dollar for some chips a quarter for some pop
we laugh and giggle some phife kiss the honeybuns
ali shaheed muhammad keeps talkin that shop
the brothers cruise on as we quest for the check
callin up famous to see if its there yet
not a bourgeoise hate the seminar
ignorant flip hey miss you must jet
flex for the funkiest buts start to bounce
measure hip-hop for weight by the ounce
bush on the tush youre pullin while i push
play me for the punk then puss feel the pounce

its like that yall keep onnnnnnn
freak freak yall keep onnnnnnnn
its like that yall keep onnnnnnn
freak freak yall keep onnnnnnnn
its like that yall keep onnnnnnn
freak freak yall keep onnnnnnnn
its like that yall keep onnnnnnn
freak freak yall keep onnnnnnnn

if the papes come yo yo i wont riff
i just sit down and get me a spliff
with mines i was born a child of the corn
molecules of the land they uplift
levels is straight in fact theyre rectified
adrenaline now is crazy multiplied
four and four is eight the fraction makes the plate
i make sure the tribe is innnnnnnn
with the quickness you bare the witness
flexin and pumpin with the fitness
movin it - uhh doin it - uhh
those who oppose must hit the s-list
doin it and doin it with the whole frame
look whats in the mind and not in the brain
on this you can quote we on a diffy note
quest for the future stead of the fame
one ninety-one brothers grabbin they thingies
forgot the name; oh equivalent to jimmy
slip a little bit you think i have to quit
ali shaheed muhammad with the singy-singy
slammin with a slammy you front on the case
right or left nut ali plays the ace
do what you do flam for a crew
bonita applebum blows smoke in shas face
slang for the  i must if ya have
dribble hops out giggle yo proper term is laugh
brothers who are snakes i label them as fakes
instincts to travel up the hood path cmon

verse one q-tip phife dawg

honey check it out you got me mesmerized
with your black hair and fat-ass thighs
street poetry is my everyday
but yo i gotta stop when you trot my way
if i was workin at the club you would not pay
aiyyo my man phife diggy he got somthin to say

i like em brown yellow puero rican or hatian
name is phife dawg from the zulu nation
told you in the jam that we can get down
now lets knock the boots like the group h-town
you got bbd all on your bedroom wall
but im above the rim and this is how i ball
a pretty little somethin on the new york street
this is how i represent over this here beat
talkin bout you

yo i took you out
but sex was on my mind for the whole damn route
my mind was in a frenzy and a horny state
but i couldnt drop dimes cause *you couldnt relate*

chorus

verse two q-tip phife dawg

stretch out your legs let me make you bawl
drive you insane drive you up the wall
starin at your dome-piece very strong
stronger than pride stronger than teflon
take you on the ave and you buy me links
now i wanna pound the putang until it stinks
you can be my mama and ill be your boy

original rude boy never am i coy
you can be a shorty in my ill convoy
not to come across as a thug or a hood
but hon you got the goods like madeline woods
by the way my names malik
the five-foot freak
lets say we get together by the end of the week
she simply said no labelled me a hoe
i said how you figure  my friends told me so
i hate when silly groupies wanna run they yap
word to god hon i dont get down like that

ill have you weak in the knees that you could hardly speak
or we could do like uncle l and swing an ep in my jeep
keep it in the down yo we keep it discrete
see im not the type to kid to have my biz in the streets

if my mom dont approve then ill just elope
let me sink the little man from inside the boat
let me hit it from the back girl i wont catch a hernia
bust off on your couch now you got seamens furniture

shaheed phife and the extra p
stacy  dj and my man lg
they know the abstract is really soul on ice
the character is  of men never ever of mice
shorty let me tell you about my only vice
it has to do with lots of lovin and *it aint nuthin nice*

chorus[chorus]
weve got the jazz 8x

[verse 1 q-tip]
stern firm and young with a laid-back tongue
the aim is to succeed and achieve at 21
just like ringling brothers ill daze and astound
captivate the mass cause the prose is profound

do it for the strong we do it for the meek
boom it in your boom it in your boom it in your jeep
or your honda or your beemer or your legend or your benz
the rave of the town to your foes and your friends

so push it along trails we blaze
dont deserve the gong dont deserve the praise
the tranquility will make ya unball your fist
for we put hip-hop on a brand new twist

a brand new twist with the homie-alistic
so low-key that ya probably missed it
and yet its so loud that it stands in the crowd
when the guy takes the beat they bowed

so raise up squire adjust your attire
we have no time to wallow in the mire
if youre on a foreign path then let me do the lead
join in the essence of the cool-out breed

then cool out to the music cuz it makes ya feel serene
like the birds and the bees and all those groovy things
like getting stomach aches when ya gotta go to work
or staring into space when ya feelin berserk

i dont really mind if its over your head
cuz the job of resurrectors is to wake up the dead
so pay attention its not hard to decipher
and after the horns you can check out the phifer

[chorus]

[verse two phife]
competition dem phifer come sideway
but competition dey mus me come straightway
competition dem phifer come sideway
but competition dey mus me come straightway

hows about that it seems like its my turn again
all through the years my mike has been my best friend
i know some brothers wonder can phifer really kick it
some even wanna dis me but why sweat it

im all into my music cuz its how i make papes
tryin to make hits like kid capri mix tapes
me sweat another  i do my own thing
strictly hardcore tracks not a new jack swing

i grew up as a christian so to jah i give thanks
collect my banks listen to shabba ranks
i sing and chat i do all of that
its 1991 and i refuse to come wack

i take off my hat to other crews that intend to rock
but the low end theorys here its time to wreck shop
i got tip and shah so whom shall i fear
stop look and listen but please dont stare

so jet to the store and buy the lp
on jive/rca cassettes and cds
produced and arranged by the four-man crew
and oh shit skeff anslem he gets props too

make sure you have a system with some phat house speakers
so the new shit can rock from mars to massapequot
cuz where i come from quality is job one
and everybody up on linden know we get the job done

so peace to that crew and peace to this crew
bring on the tour well see you at a theatre nearest you

[verse three q-tip]
hey yo but wait back it up huh easy back it up
please let the abstract embellish on the cut

back and forth just like a cameo song
if you dig this joint then please come dance along
to the music cuz its done just for the rhyme
now i gotta scat and get mine underlined

my mother went away for a month-long trip
her and some friends on an ocean-liner ship
she made a big mistake by leaving me home
i had to roam so i picked up the phone
dialed ali up to see what was going down
told him i pick him up so we could drive around
took the dodge dart a 74
my mother left a yard but i needed one more
shaheed had me covered with a hundred greenbacks
so we left brooklyn and we made big tracks
drove down the belt got on the conduit
came to a toll we paid and went through it
had no destination we was on a quest
ali laid in the back so he can get rest
drove down the road for two days and a half
the sun had just risen on a dusty path
just then a figure had caught my eye
a man with a sombrero who was four feet high
i pulled over to ask were we was at
his index finger he tipped up his hat
el segundo he said my name is pedro
if you need directions ill tell you pronto
needed civilization some sort of reservation
he said a mile south theres a fast food station
thanks senor as i start up the motor
ali said damn tip what you drive so far for

well describe to me what the wallet looks like

anyway a gas station we passed
we got gas and went on to get grub
it was a nice little pub in the middle of nowhere
anywhere would have been better
i ordered enchiladas and i ate em
ali had the fruit punch
when we finished we thought for ways to get back
i had a hunch
ali said pay for lunch so i did it
pulled out the wallet and i saw this wicked 
beautiful lady she was a waitress there
put the wallet down and stared and stared
to put me back into reality heres shaheed
yo tip man you got what you need
i checked for keys and started to step 
but what do you know my wallet i forget

yo it was a brown wallet it had props numbers 
had my jimmy hats i got to get it man

lord have mercy
the heat got hotter ali starts to curse me
i feel bad but he makes me feel badder
chit-chit-chatter car stars to scatter
breaking on out we was northeast bound
jettin on down at the speed of sound
three days coming and three more going
we get back and there was no slack
490 madison were here sha
he said all right tip see you tomorrow
thinking about the past week the last week
hands go in my pocket i cant speak
hopped in the car and torpeed to the shack
of shaheed we gotta go back 
when he said why i said we gotta go
cause i left my wallet in el segundo

yeah i left my wallet in el segundo
left my wallet in el segundo
left my wallet in el segundo
i gotta get it i got-got ta get it
left my wallet in el segundo
left my wallet in el segundo

suckers walkin around talking about they could get some 
but that pop is non cypher no can do 
and if you think im a dope then ask the other crew 
and i proceed to let you know exactly how to flow 
im not lawn doctor so just step off with the hoe 
oops my mistake i didnt know you went with her 
should i run down the line of the all the kids that done hit her 
dont be bitter i hear that honey resembles a critter 
i heard she likes to do one-one my man john ritter 
but back to the subject you cant catch wreck 
you must get respect to earn respect 
suckers think they could herb me cuz know i wear specks 
youre full of jokes but you your name aint flex 
i got the riches the bitches im large like a huxtable 
you think youre all that but youre girls quite doable 
yeah im tellin you g to back up off me 
im not a mad cohort but im not mr softee 
rappin is an art coming straight from the heart 
so forget the chart because the action can start 

chorus 

verse two q-tip

im the undercover brother dump your hoe in the trunk 
save all the sad songs and the tearjerkers 
niggaz step back its the lyrical worker 
the poems that i create aint in paper back books 
the poems that i create are for hookers and the crooks 
my mental is excelling cuz i dabble in the books 
im not the one to front on so suboops-suboops 
yo i gets the pickens im such a damn dickens 
if you step to this then the plot just thickens 
ill run you around the track like a bunny and a dog 
to me your just another mc on the log 
a link on the chain fluid on the brain 
i boast of hype lyrics and yours are mundane 
see i cant maintain especially if you come back 
im the lyrical master blaster yeah i can do that 
i can also do your girl so leave the hoe at home 
cuz when i get done ill have her strung on bones 
its the no-joke pressure that elevates my mind 
makes me pick up and go when its time to drop my rhymes 
my title is locked the abstract poetic 
im in the idle mode but my energys kinetic 
so smooth and debonair especially for the ear 
gotta keep my thing in gear cuz its evident and clear 
that i will rock rock rock fades away 

chorusq-tip

verse one

yo i aint one to complain but theres things in the game
and whats your name consequence im tight burnt like flames
well whys that american dreams they got the ghetto kid in a fiend

q-tip
dont stress that cause its not in your bloodstream
your whole being comes from greatness dyou remember
shatan got you caught in the storms of december
and brothers on the block packin nines like september
crazy situations keeps pockets on slender

consequence
yo i be on the avenue where they be actin brand new
im splurgin on these reebok joints for shorty boo

q-tip
all of a sudden i saw these two kids frontin 
talkin out they joints but they wasnt sayin nothin
my hand was on my toolie they was actin unruly

but i swallowed my pride and let that nonsense ride 
because im positive and seems that negative dies

consequence
yo we was at the dice game makin these cats look silly
flamin steady runnin off at the willie

q-tip

consequence
and i was doin it til i met ike spike and mike

q-tip
yo i know the feelin when you feelin like a villain
you be havin good thoughts but the evils be revealin
and the stresses of life can take you off the right path no doubt
jealousy and envy tends to infiltrate your staff
we gotta hold it down so we can move on past
all adversities so we can get through fast like that

chorus

verse two
consequence

you got the nwo low cash flow
your babys on the way and you dont know who

with a poultry scrap workers get pistol smacked
the switch hittin queens niggaz liquid sword spittin
with raw poppy and now your first love is krill
your vision of the mil got crept like hey lover
tried to rise to the top you just couldnt recover
and all i want is my laceration of the pie
to get this whip cream before the water runs dry

brother brother brother lucien youre like no other

theyll put you back to france on a ship with a sail
escargot lucien you eat snails

instead of doin so much why dont you do just a little
boy what a cad i guess we shouldnt treat him bad

a case of positionin the feet in the shoes
sympathetic reason in the case of the blues
lucien is blue even though hes really brown

in the morning woke up from sexual pleasures
looked at her sexual partner
who acquainted her acquaintance
five hours ago at a disco
she went lower than low into limbo
a thought crossed the mind her a bimbo
she answered no so she had to go
on with the program
creedence it seems that ive forgotten your name
but it seems that shes done the same
and now something has happened
suddenly shes been distracted
by something that has been attracted
she poked and poked and smacked at it
then she broke down and she scratched it
now i think you understand
clinic saw the doctor flex his biceps
then he picked up a pair of forceps
her pretty face showed fright
right then and there she fainted
a really grim picture is painted
the brotha who she acquainted
was the enemy scary aint it
the pubic enemy

q-tip
old king cole was a merry old soul
had a lady queen married since 18
he protested that he was infested
get lots of love and he couldnt digest it
all propaganda one big fat lie
cuz i see the king with my very own eye
schemed and schemed like a crack fiend king
and poppin up on the teammates scene
and poppin and pimpin hunnies with moneys
whole situation to tip was kinda funny
he hold the crown but not the jimmy hat
now he wears a frown and the jimmy hates that
so the fair maiden in the royal bedroom
caught the king scratchin so she had to assume
that he got vicked by the enemys trick
the thought of cheatin made the maiden so sick
that she screamed and screamed went on and kept screamin
threw a pot and his dome was beamin
you could hear him yellin in the motherland
baby baby please baby understand
she ignored and walked through the gate
the king is in the kingdom to await his fate
of the enemy the pubic enemy

q-tip
everybody get sweaten a deep is still a threaten
about the  that hate the  but still will be forgetten
about the  like the rocky picture horror
dont move tracks cause the pubic had the hour
you can get it from sleepin in nasty dirty sheets and
wearin nasty cothes for all about the weekend
i suggest you do yourself a big favour
the  keep questin ima damn  savior
please remember this a kiss is just a kiss
a hug is just a hug but a bugging gets the bug
if you get the bug oh boy youll be buggin
 home  started lovin
damn after loving just take it out
dont get so far to q man

inspect yourself trotect yourself
respect yourself then correct yourself
make sure you dont get hand by the man[intro]

afro-centric living is a big shrug
a life filled with *horn* thats what i love
a lower plateu is what were above
