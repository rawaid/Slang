niggas havin bad intentions sendin bgs on a mission
one move too many nigga you missin

when its time to duel you get two men
two heaters one street one clock

if youre quick on the draw youre gon see the morgue
but if youre too slow
i catch you on the downlow oh no
oh no you mean the kid shits real

you mean the little bitty niggas with the itchy trigger fingers
yeah were on a mission ta kansas slippin thru texas
we stopped at bonanza to get us some hot cakes
bacon and eggs and then we slip in the whorehouse to get us some leg
hop back on the horses enforcers of courses
the niggas in black the fearless four horsemen
searchin for this location on the map
the gold rush baby got ta have it i gots ta have it
it feels just like its 1865
and a trigger look-a-day is how i ride

time to heat shootin range
quick with the heat on their hip
young jesse james come to test your aim
i seen you at th e wild horny corral
i hearda ya name
tha forcify nigga you aint never lie
besides im in the mood so at high noon we ride
from coast to coast niggas mash on every stage coach
my disciples with rifles lethal in whole posts
the off-the-rocker roller coaster
on a six-shooter holster
with dpg on every wanted poster
let me think about which bank to gank
which fellow ta shoot and which teller to shank
i want all the shit you got in stacks
attached to this skirt in the corner
so i snatched the bitch in the back
the dogg in me feels for the lust
but the hogg in me makes me wanna bust
back to the drawin down board
nowadays we drawn down more
to survive thru all the round wards
battle up or saddle up and shake the scene
or getcha pockets shaken clean the slugs in ya spleen
i cant help it im heartless ya cant hack it
with my six-shooters on my hips and dusty jacket
like that cock back
quick to pull my strap
just to put the horsemen on the map
the gold rush

 from lbc crew

born is doggystyle individual james got the hots
i got the six shots for all the plans and plots
i gots lots o cash stashed in money bags
worthy workers for all the russian blabbermouths and gags
i got stacks so my stacks excell
hop in the coach wit my twelve clydesdales and bells
im on the move smooth to my decoy horse
a 30-30 on my side to shoot a nigga o course
it aint no stoppin young josey
box all the nosey
headed to the saloon with my platoon where all the hos be
left a dusty trail bailed in swell
gold spurs on the gators set back the clientele
oh well for the recop i drop my bet
divide between my homies and ride the sunset

bad azz from lbc crew

two sacks o money from the train heist
they aint even counted it up
just mounted it up
rode west toward the coaster six-shooters in the holster
pass thru a run-down town whose walls hold my poster
closer i get ta death which is every second makes me sweat
so i gotta have what i can get
heard word about the gold rush and headed west
on my white horsey with three straps in my napsack
giddy up the next town i rode thru
i had to threaten to blow their city up
undebts with chief black caught five miles west
sell us some beads and hail us some weed
he offered me a toke
he didnt have a twin he had that peace-pipe smoke
i almost choked
break him for the get right im off into the sunset
tryin ta reach my destiny fast
its these two bags o cash
44s cocked i aint makin no mo stops
till i hit the spot i made it twelve on the dot
i slid off my boots counted my loot
five minutes after the strike of midnight
i counted 200 gs i cocked my strap and slept tight
at the gold rush at the gold rush
at the gold rush at the gold rush

and all the kid do was cry like a bitch

just in case you niggas wanna fuck and try to act hard

outro *reporter speaking over hook*

deadly serious in east los angeles and south central where people
encounter stray dogs on a daily basis and often bare the scars to prove it--soopafly--
i had this bitch locked on to me like she was way too clever
man soopafly never ever ever
fell for the do no and you know im
too swift on my toes and the gifts of hoez
its too much for me to be givin to you
uh all im givin is some dick in you
now sh i told the bitch to blaze the weed
now she blazed it but that aint all she blew
hey i got knocked off on the bar
and my room got knocked off in the car
gave it to me until i reached my peak
baby flip talkin bout lovin me in the week
i said thats too damn quick and too damn fast
youve been givin up too much damn cock and givin up too much ass
nah nah nah you aint gettin me like that
soopafly aint even called the bitch back
ever since she tripped i went on one
stepped in the club caught me a homerun
baby was bad and all she said gimme a call
i wanted to break that bitch like a law
picked her up at the bus stop she was soft and smooth
talkin bout what could pop out and hit the roof
then she said somethin bout the cost
man that same bus stop is where 
i dropped that bitch back the fuck off
you cant ride my bird
so i kicked that bitch to the curb
you best to believe
you aint got no trick up your sleeve that can get with me

you thought you had my grip
but soopafly never ever slips
you thought you had my cash
till i turned around and whupped yo ass
like a pimp and thats for real

--snoop dogg--
i came through in a zoot suit pin stripe lookin too cute
tryin to get my shoot on so im a scoot on
over to the next bitch say her name is texas
she fly but she wasnt the sexiest
she had a hoe with her named bama short for alabama
a big bad mama-jamma now look here
i like big bitches cause they large
and big bitches always take charge
wanna grab a skinny nigga like snoop dogg
cause you like it tall go and work it baby doll
now a great big girl got a hell of a grip to grab a hold of
got alot of cash for a little love
all they wanna do is take you down to the mall
floss a little dick and get a t-shirt that say miss snoop dogg
i dont see a god damn thang
thats stoppin you from buying me that god damn ring
itd look nice on my finger im a buy you a zinger
cause you make me feel like a real hip-hop singer
your homegirl bring her cause ive been dying to meet her
you know i wont cheat her dont mistreat her

but ill drop her ass cause you know i dont need her

but snoop dogg never ever slips
you thought you had my cash
until i turned around and whupped your ass
trick beyotch beyotch

--too $hort--

gold diggin tramps tryin to get with this dick
for all the wrong reasons
niggas aint trippin during pimp season
but you still jumped your fast ass in anyway
if any other nigga picked you up itd be payday
i rolled to my house with the bitch
whatd you do $hort introduced her mouth to my dick
glad to meet you make yourself comfortable

so you might as well enjoy the ride
and serve this nigga from the eastside
how much for the game that im sellin

i know sex sells but im a tell you though
couldnt spend on shit that aint valuable
fucked all night woke up the next mornin

since he wasnt no type of big chronic dealer
the homie nate dogg didnt appeal to her
but now he wear boots that match with his suits
and push a lexus coupe thats extra cheap
and now she stop flautin and wont it speakin

she caught the vapors

i got a little cousin thats kinda plain
he bring the heeb wit tha beep for the dogg pound gang
a mellow type of fellow best laid back
but back in the day he wasnt nuthin like that
i remember when he used to scrap every day
when my auntie would tell him he would never obey
he wore his khakis hangin down wit his starks untied
and a blue and grey cap that said the eastside
around my neighborhood tha people treated him bad
said daz was the worst thing his mom ever had
they said he grow up to be nuttin but a gangsta
or be there in jail or some other shaker
but now hes grown up to be a surprise
d-a-z got a hit record slangin world wide
now the same people that didnt like him as a child

and said can i be down champ they said
no and treated me like a wet food stamp
after gettin rejected i aint runnin upset

1st verse
now if you tired of the hard work

and you still up in debt
walkin round town all strapped in
niggas be havin more bad times than captain rat did
two strikes none left out of breath
livin in the city its a jungle yo
all this deception on top of stress
you havin more problems than a algebra test
you cant seem to come up wit yo money for rent
and now yo baby momma trippin she want fifty percent
its a thin line between yours and mine
the difference is you gotta scratch to a get nickel and dime
now i know a place where
ya might wanna be and i can take you there 
pop goes the nine well go right behind
you can slide off your shoes sit back and recline

chorus

2nd verse
oh your homies think youre funny

just to impress the honeys this is for the honeys

you got two strikes but you right back up to bat
you all about yo money and got something to sell
but if you bail for a robber youll be back in the jail cell
you chillin wit yo feet up
someone hated but baby without the homies and
thats when you got beat up
because you cant be out there doin low
and then right gather up yo crew and roll
aint no rules when you out there doin dirt
somebodys always layin in the cut to get ya hurt
but see i know a place where
you might wanna be 
and i can take you there
pop goes the nine well go right behind
you can slide off your shoes sit back and recline

chorus

smugglindoin things from handin a gunis what they fearin
bodyguards and hitmen like some al capone shit
heavy artillery got the cops on my dick
different locationsspots where it takes place

theres four major games that run the city of gs
the violatorsthe gambinos and the corleones and me
the violators and gambinos they run uptown
me and my cousin corleone we run downtown
murders an everyday thang in the city
where you gotta plot chipsjag robberies and do in its
tanadian naythe charge of the weapons
hit from verandahs and do a thing unexpected
so we plan a plot with an uzi and 10 shot
buck em till they all dropcircle round the block
let em have it as soon as they come out
unload on their asscommence to takin them out

interludedaz talking
throughout the streets of long beach
the streets was infected with drugsdope pealers and addicts
gangs have taken over 75% of our town as the young
youth behaviour is outrageous with crime
they feel no remorse whatsoever as the law enforcements
have tried to stop the trafficking of drugs
from coming into our country but they cant
the murders have increased more than 95% and the drug amount
of which they make is more than 700 million dollars
now wanted by the irs and we will convict them of tax evasion

verse twotray dee
i had no choice or remorse for time for puttin it down
niggas know the scoop is stupid if they come from my town
i been around since the jumpstreet makin it pop
young crook keepin hookniggashakin the spot

look for helpyou help yourself cos theres no handout
since the city long beach is only gs and hos
you hold on ya heat but them fiendish foes
trustbustbe aware and i aint ya curse
cos the niggas that i dared to agank the first
think i might be deceased fore i reach my calling
as long as im haulin my heat im stallin
i bring it to ya hard from the streets of life
where niggas get rewarded to grief for strikes
dont speak on the creepmo fools is listenin
and war story glory aint worth the riskin
real niggas still get a mob like respect

motherfucking manonce upon a time in the lbc
on the eastside off of 2-1 street
there lived a young man cinderfellas his name
to make it interesting its me peep game
i lived in a house with my cruel step-dad
and two step-brothers who treated me bad
i cooked i cleaned i scrubbed the floors
and i was like an errand boy runnin to the stores
my brothers they used to boast and brag
weve got fubu and youve got rags
and even worse than that to make me feel low
they gave me a skateboard while they had low-lows
girls used to say snoop youre so cute
but you gets no rap with that to up khaki suit
welllll one day up the avenue
there was a man surrounded by the dogg pound crew
he said ah hear ye hear ye come one come all
the princess is having a royal ball
if you can rap also dress fresh
you might win a date with the sweet princess
well i um ran home when i heard the newsflash
i bust through the door straight to my step-dad
i said step-dad may i
and before i could finish hell no he replied cinderfella
my brothers were goin they were gettin down
even pops was goin for a piece of the crown cinderfella
they flaunted they haunted they knew what i wanted
we can and you cant is what they taunted nana-nana-nah-nah
they all stood there laughin in my face
and as they walked out they said clean up this place

cinderfella doggy dogg
and im the rapper doggy dogg you love
cinderfella doggy dogg
and im the rapper doggy dogg you love
cinderfella doggy dogg
and im the rapper doggy dogg you love
cinderfella doggy dogg
and im the rapper doggy dogg you love

well i shrugged i hissed they all tried to diss
and id get them back if i had one wish
before i could make my thought a phrase
there appeared a man from a puff of haze
he said whats up dogg my name is herb
im your fairy doggfather you know it word
now ive came here with the main purpose
of granting you your fondest wish
i said herb my man just make me fresh
and im sure that i can handle all the rest
with a snap of his fingers sparks began to shoot
and i was jumpin in my body a slick silk suit
on my feet was some white tube socks
and a fresh pair of chucks from the foot-lock
i showed him my sack and dont you know
with a snap the sack became some doe-doe
once again his hands began to flow
then he changed my skateboard into a six-fo damn
he checked me over passed me the keys
and said one more thing before you leave
you must return before the stroke of twelve
or youll turn back into your old self

cinderfella doggy dogg
and im the rapper doggy dogg you love
cinderfella doggy dogg
and im the rapper doggy dogg you love

i jumped in the low-low and went on my way
i got to the party bout ten id say
it was after eleven when i rocked the mic
and by the time i left the stage the people were hyped well alright
the princess was starin while holdin a drank
reflected from her eyes was gold tank
she waved her hands like hello  hi
then gave another gesture like come here guy
i left the stage girls came in flocks
the bitch was swingin from the hard knocks
i heard a sound not a tick nor tock
gong first bell before twelve oclock
no time to waste i broke out in haste
the princess followed in a futile chase
a quick steady pace is what i kept
lost one of my chucks on one of those steps
for the six-fo i continued my stride
about this time i heard gong five
i was down the block when i heard gong eight
and the princess screamed out wait wait wait wait

cinderfella doggy dogg
and im the rapper doggy dogg you love
cinderfella doggy dogg
and im the rapper doggy dogg you love

i was almost home when my luck ran out
and there went my suit my doe sack and clout
my fresh low-low also went too
and there was no denyin that my night was through
the one all-star the freshest thing i sported
jumped on my board for home i skateboarded
made it to my pad no time at all
went to my room or better yet the far wall
hid the shoe away still feelin pleased
then jumped in my cot to catch some zs
early the next mornin when i awoke
i threw on me old slippers with me old housecoat
slid into the front my family stared at me
sayin wasnt that you  nah it couldnt be
they kept askin me if i did my chores
my butt was saved by a knock at the door
who is it thats what my brothers barked
the princess this sweet voice remarked
she said she was lookin for a certain man
who could bring her the shoe like the one in her hand
the family ran around with their heads in the air
bringin her shoes from everywhere
she just shook her head a nod of relief
and said no thats not the one that im lookin for chief
i ran in the room and got my shoe
and said is this the one youre referring to
well she said yes and youre so cute
but wheres your doe-doe and slick silk suit
i put on the shoe then there came a flash of light
and i was wearin shit from just last night
looked out the window saw the six-fo
yelled to my family ive got to go
we drove up the avenue the princess and i
and in back of me i heard my family cry

thats actually not the first time that questions been asked; but 
since i believe and i think any person - reasonable person would 
believe that that is not covered in the definition of sexual 
relations i was given - ahh - im not going to answer it except to 
refer to my statement  i had intimate contact with her that was 
inappropriate - i do not believe any of the contacts i had with 
her violated the definition i was given; therefore i believe i 
did not do anything but testify truthfully on these matters

mad doggin niggaz cause i dont care
red jumpsuit with two braids in my hair
niggaz stare as i enter the center

late night i hear toothbrushes scrapin on the floor
niggaz gettin they shanks just in case the war pops off

and he probably wont make it to see twenty-two
i put that on my momma ima ride for you baby boo

and these damncan you feel it nothing can save ya
for this is the season of catching the vapors
since i got time what im gonna do
tell ya how its spreading throughout my crew
what you want on nate dogg
who sings on my records never leave me alone
aint no fun now check it
back in the days before nate dogg would get it
he used to try to holler at this girl named pam
the type of female wit fly gucci gear
she wore a big turkish wole wit a weave in her hair
when they tried to kick it shed always fess
talkin about baby please she wrought his service stress
since he wasnt no type of big chronic dealer
the homie nate dogg didnt appeal to her
but now he wear boots that match with his suits
and push a lexus coupe thats extra cheap
and now she stop flautin and wont it speakin
be comin round the pound every single weekend
to get his beeper number she be beggin please
dyin for the day to eat these

she caught the vapors
she caught the vapors

i got a little cousin thats kinda plain
he bring the heeb wit tha beep for the dogg pound gang
a mellow type of fellow best laid back
but back in the day he wasnt nuthin like that
i remember when he used to scrap every day
when my auntie would tell him he would never obey
he wore his khakis hangin down wit his starks untied
and a blue and grey cap that said the eastside
around my neighborhood tha people treated him bad
said daz was the worst thing his mom ever had
they said he grow up to be nuttin but a gangsta
or be there in jail or some other shaker
but now hes grown up to be a surprise
d-a-z got a hit record slangin world wide
now the same people that didnt like him as a child
bought the dogg food doggfather and doggystyle

they caught the vapors
they caught the vapors

i got another homie from tha l-b-c
known ta yall as dj warren g
he cut grass trasform wit finesse
 and all that mess
i remember when we first started to rap
he tried to get this job at calvins record shop
he was in it to win it but the boss front and said
sorry warren g but theres no help wanted
now my homie warren still tried
on and on and on til the like break of dawn
to work at tha v-i-p would be the link
but they looked right past him so my homie straight dip
now for the year after regulate
warren g is havin papers so my homies write straight
he walked into the same record shop as before
and the boss be like warren welcome to my store
offerin him a job but nah he dont want it
damn it feels good to see people love warren
cause i remember when at first they wasnt
now guess what they call sessy bussin

the vapors
they caught vapors
i got to talk bout me now

last subject of tha story is about snoop dogg
i had to work for mine to show i was a true hog
when i was a teenager i tried to be down
and since they wasnt tryin to hear me i made the dogg pound
i saw a crew on 2-1 street
and said can i be down champ they said
no and treated me like a wet food stamp
after gettin rejected i aint runnin upset
i said whats a dogg do to  rhymes at rates
when i used to go to parties they make me wait
what i have to get on the mic to set m-c straight
i aint never love no hoe since im listenin to my music
they acted like i wanted to keep hangin with the juzi
but now things switched from west to east
short dogg do ya remember me from 21st street g
we used to see daz back in the day

yauh
i was once told
you get your freedom
by letting your enemy know that
youll do anything to get your freedom
then youll get it
its the only way youll get it
when you get that kind of attitude
theyll label you as a crazy negro
or they just call you a crazy nicca
they dont say negro
or theyll call you an extremist
or a subversive 
or a setatus
or a red or radical
but when you stay radical long enough
and get enough people to like you
youll get your freedom
so dont rum around here 
tryin to make friends
with somebody whos deprivin
you of your rights
their not your friends
no they ya enemys
and treat them like that
and fight them
and youll get your freedom
and after you get your freedom
your enemy will respect you and will respect you
and i say that with no hate
cuz i dont have no hate in me
i have no hate at all
so i say to you big man
im the man you think you are
if you want to know what ill do
figure out what youll do
and ill do the same 
only more of it nicca

in the beginning as a child i was chosen
though not knowin the reason while still my eyes opened
whatever the purpose i surfaced above the fog
love was given to all outside livin the ball
as an adolescent one black child i had a message
to reach teachin the masses i wrote my first passage
it was jotted down created in the form of a rap
im young livin in the city of jackers and gangbangin
and dope dealin cold feelin to be a product of niggaz around you
once you get on top they down you
but the temptation got me streets caught me watchin
i found myself grindin on the streets quite often
with a blue rag bangin the dub fo-fifth coffin
at the spot 61st 40 blocks from the eastside
where most of the big homies had a glock and flossed the g-ride


niggaz throwin up hands but it wasnt no peace signs
never fo a second did i think to let my light shine
hardheaded thought i was grown messin up
disrespectin my home not carin bout what moms what sayin
and then i found out that mom wasnt playin
today i love you for it back then i couldnt understand
get my life right step it up nigga be a man
never be a victim of what the system might hit you with
through the stripes still gotta shine my light
ive grown to comprehend the game; my name is big snoop boss dogg
just a block and a phone call away
ive reached the status of a modern day john baptist
im preachin just what i practice
to each and all i got a word from the beach to acros the globe
man woman young and old
dont gain the world lose your soul to spite
many circumstances doggy gon shine my light cause i love you

a pocket full of women understanding how im living 
show them hoes how you winning 
its the beginning with the pearls youre given 
the world soft like linen and sweet like cinnamon 
but everyday like 50 say its +many men+ 
they wanna take me out the spot they want the pussy and the ends 
but separate the paper and the benz and the cribs 
then the hoes then the clothes ima have to let em go 
you know how the dogg roll dont get it twisted 
cause he bang out the east just in case you wanna visit 
a touch of the exquisite mixed with somethin pimpish 
and its comin from the beach where them niggaz is a beast 
but i just listen all that shit is in my past 
im connected to the purse first nigga the ass last 
from long beach to venice is the premise 
want the green like spinach and im strong to the finish

thinkin that they blessed by the actions that be comin out 
when you in magic city you be carrying a lot of clout 
but trickin aint the route [route] thats even if you got it 
theres a method to you holdin it when they cant do without it 
just put the key up in it nigga if she bout it 
you can have her and her partner fuckin with it for a dolla 
if she a balla she gon ride with a shot caller 
roll with the bo$$ dogg in the back of a blue impala 
and if she follow then she gon swallow 
all the game you got to give her be a different bitch tomorrow 
but i would never bother breakin out [tha doggfather]

im just an author spreading game to my partners 
walkin on the blue carpet with the doctor [doctor

verse snoop dogg
i guess its true you cant take the hood out a homeboy
plus my hood just lost another homeboy
another one got life and we dont know if he coming home boy
they in the street tell me just leave it alone boy
let them do them take care of your own boy
but i said back brake a bound before i was grown boy

banging for the turf late night huntin
puttin me in work good day comin airbrush shirt
pay day got the spot got my hair cut first
made mom sick when i wouldnt go to church
yeah i live in the burbs but i think 21st
i know since i left that its gotten much worse
but id still be there if i couldnt write a verse


chorus charlie wilson
im a man i gotta take care of my family

i know my mind should be on shining and getting grammies
but these streets wont say a goodbye


verse snoop dogg
to the blocks that raise me the enemies and the homies that made
me tough enough to hang on the corners that would mould me
critics wonder if im tryna be the old me
but if they think the old me ever left then they dont really know me
and dont know we dont change we just become og you always addicted
to the life you just dont od shit i owe the streets before they owe me
took me in when my momma didnt want me to wild to be a child and pops
not around now all i got now is the homies to teach me how to be a man
in what not how to brake ounces in the grams in what not
the reason im so nice with my hands in what not shit you think i forgot man naw


chorus charlie wilson
im a man i gotta take care of my family

verse snoop dogg
thank god every day that the boy could spit
and all around the world they enjoyin my shit
i know i got plenty more wars to get
i got a beautiful wife and some gorgeous kids
but it wouldnt be right if i ignore the shit
they made me how i am the music in the man
told me that i can for the world gave a damn
if it wasnt for my niggas sayin stick to the plan
probably be a gun instead of a pen in my hand
probably be doin a dub and the pen with my man
the say leaders streets but they dont really understand
all i had was the block when i didnt have fans
rapped on the corners when i couldnt get spins
all i had was the homies when i didnt have kids
if it all come down and my career was to end im sure my name
would live in these streets

this game you could never win
cause they love you then they hate you then they love you again
get away from me misery
get away from me lonliness
get away from me fake bitches i cant take the phoniness
get away from me wack tracks
i can only make only hits
im an only child lost in the world
where did the lonely kids go when the bell ring
its feeling like hell rings
bringing me back down
checking my background
its ironic whats happening
imagine if i didnt have the ends
i wouldnt have so many imaginary friends
im spaced out dog i be on that moon talk
wonder if god ask mike how to moon walk
i swear to momma wish me and my father talk more
i stopped visiting around the time i was a sophmore
i guess everything i hate about me i see in him
and we aint finna change so we wont agree again
till then ill be pouring out my soul
just a few things i see with my eyes closed

[chorus]
and i can see it with my eyes closed now

jumping in and out of the range
maybe an old school
spinning the vision from each i paint

gotta keep rhyming
east side high you are doing life/right
 blowing in the wind
you are thinking of me
its gangster bliss
this is what youre calling a sis
pass the morphine quick
memories is miss
i made a lot of friends
a whole lot of money
been down a couple times
but it never stopped my rhyming
in fact i got better

a world shows in dumfries

and i will never be questioned
by some new young
snoopy d made the way for you to walk
o in to the almighty

you never tried to know you tried to groove me
like some loco i earned my respect

but all alone i did it b
cool as a blind with a c
leveled my life as i push away the goopy
but in the you can call me up a snoopy

repeats

dont worry about your circumstances
take your chances
still from the l b c
you are the c
haler at your own for snoopy
