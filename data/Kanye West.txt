we take that money cop work than push packs to get paid
and we dont care what people say
mama say she wanna move south

so niggas money is homo its hard to get straight
so we gon keep baking to the day we get cake
and we dont care what people say

and for that paper look how low well stoop 
even if you in a benz you still a nigga in a coup 

[chorus] 

[kanye west]

we buy our way out of jail but we cant buy freedom 
we buy a lot of clothes but we dont really need them 
things we buy to cover up whats inside 
cuz they made us hate ourself and love they wealth 
thats why shortys holla where the ballas at 
drug dealers buy jordans crackhead buy crack 
and the white man get paid off of all of that

and next these niggas might jack your lexus 
somebody tell these niggas who kanye west is 

i walk through the valley where the shadow of death is 
top floor of the view alone will leave you breathless 
try to catch it  its kind of hard 
getting choked by detectives yeah yeah now check the method 
they be asking us questions harass and arrest us 
saying we eat pieces of shit like you for breakfast 
huh yall eat pieces of shit whats the basis 
we aint going no where but got suits and cases 
a trunk full of coke rental car from avis

and i dont think theres nothing i can do to right my wrong 
jesus walks with me 
i wanna talk to god but im afraid because we aint spoke in so long

jesus walks with them 
to the victims of welfare feel we living in hell here hell yea

now hear ye hear ye wanna see thee more clearly 
i know he hear me when my feet get weary 
cause were the almost nearly extinct 
we rappers is role models we rap we dont think

or here to convert atheists into believers 
im just trying to say the way school need teachers 
the way kathy lee needed regis thats the way i need jesus 
so here go my single dawg radio needs this

i see them repoed resold then redriven
so when i reload he holds number one positions
when you hot im hot
and when your feet cold mines are sizzlin
its plain to see
niggas cant fuck wit me

[kanye west]
get up i get down for my grandfather who took my momma 
made her sit in that seat where white folks aint want us to eat
at the tender age of 6 she was arrested for the sit-ins
and with that in my blood i was born to be different
now niggas cant make it to ballots to chose leadership
but we can make it to jacobs or to the dealership
thats why i hear new music and i just dont be feelin it
racism still alive they just be concealin it 
but i know they dont want me in the damn club
they even make me show id to get up inta sams club
i did deal dirt and went to church to get my hands scrubbed
that why ive baptized these 3 or 4 times
but in the land where niggas praise
yukons and getting paid
its gon take a lot more than coupons to get us saved
like it take a lot more than do-rags to get your way
nothin sad as that day my girl father passed away
so i promise to mr raney im gonna marry your daughter 
and you know i gotta thank you for they way that she was brought up
and i know that you were smiling when you seen the car i bought her
and you sent tears from heaven when you seen my car get balled up but
i cant complain what the accident did to my left eye
cuz look what an accident did to left eye
first aaliyah now romeo must die
i know i got angels watchin me from the other side

one thing i found one thing i found
oh no youll never let me down
get up i get down
get up i get down
get up i get down
get up i get down
get up i get down
get up i get down

[jivy]
were all here for a reason on a particular path
you dont need a curriculum to know that you are part of the math
cats think im delirious but im so damn serious
thats why i expose my soul to the globe the world
im trying to make it better for these little boys and girls
im not just another individual my spirit is a part of this
thats why i get spiritual but i get my hymns from him
so its not me its he thats lyrical
im not a miracle im a heaven-sent instrument
my rhythmatic regimen navigates melodic notes for your soul and your mental
thats why im instrumental
vibrations is what im into
yeah i need my loot by rent day
but that aint what gives me the heart of kunta kinte
im tryina give us us free like cinque
i cant stop thats why im hot
determination dedication motivation
im talking to you my many inspirations
when i say it i cant let you or self down
if i were on the highest cliff on the highest rift
and you slipped off the side and clenched on to your life in my grip
i would never ever let you down
and when these words are found
let it been known that gods penmanship has been signed with a language called love
thats why my breath is felt by the deaf
and why my words are heard and confined to the ears of the blind
i too dream in color and in rhyme
so i guess im one of a kind in a full house
cuz whenever i open my heart my soul or my mouth
a touch of god rains out

[kanye west]
takeem to church

when it comes to being true at least true to me
one thing i found one thing i found
oh no youll never let me down
get up i get down

kanye west
so this a&amp;r over at roc-a-fella named hip hop picked the truth beat for beanie and i was in the session with him
i had my demo with me you know like i always do
i play the songs hes like who that spittin im like its me hes like oh well okay
uh he started talkin to me on the phone going back and forth
just askin me to send him beats and im thinking hes trying to get into managing producers cause he had this other kid named just blaze he was messin with
and um he was friends with my mentor no id
and no id told him look man you wanna mess with kanye you need to tell him that you like the way he rap
yo you wanna sign him tell him you like how he rap
i was all i dunno if he was gassin me or not but hes like he wanna manage me as a rapper and a producer
ill sign you as a producer and a rapper
im like oh shit
i was messin with uh d-dot also
people were like this started talking about the ghost production but thats how i got in the game
if it wasnt for that i wouldnt be here
so you know after they picked that truth beat i was figuring i was gonna do some more work but shit just wasnt poppin off like that
i was stayin in chicago i had my own apartment i be doin like just beats for local acts just to try to keep the lights on and be able to go out and buy get a pelle pelle off layaway get some jordans or something or get a technomarine thats what we wore back then
i made this one beat where i sped up this harold melvin sample
i played it for hip over the phone hes like oh yo that shit is crazy jay might want it for this compilation album he doin called the dynasty
and at that time like the drums really werent soundin right to me
so i went and um i was listening to dre chronic 2001 at that time and really i just like bit the drums off xxplosive and put it like with it sped up sampled
and now its kind of like my whole style when it started when he rapped on this cant be life
and that was like really the first beat of that kind that was on the dynasty album
i could say that was the the resurgence of the soul sound and you know i got to come in and track the beat and at the time i was still with my other management
i really wanted to roll with hip hop cause i i just needed some fresh air you know what im sayin cause i been there for a while i appreciated what they did for me but you know theres a time in every mans life where he gotta make a change to try to move up to the next level
and that day i came and i tracked the beat and i got to meet jay-z and he said oh you a real soulful dude
oh you a real soulful dude man
and he uh played the song cause he already spit his verse by the time i got to the studio you know how he do it one take
and he said tell me what you think of this
check this out tell me what you think of this right here
and i heard it and i was thinking like man i really wanted more like of the simple type jay-z
i aint want like the the more introspective complicated rhy- or the in my personal opinion
so he asked me what you think of it
so what you think of this
and i was like man that shit tight
you know what im sayin man what imma tell him
i was on the train man you know
so after that i went back home and man im im just in chicago im trying to do my thing
you know i got groups i got acts im trying to get on and like there wasnt nothin really like poppin off the way it should have been
one of my homies that was one of my artists he got signed
but it was supposed to really go through my production company but he ended up going straight with the company
so like im just straight holdin the phone gettin the bad news that dude was tryin to leave my company
and i got evicted at the same time
so i went down and tracked the beats from him
i took that money came back packed all my shit up in a u-haul maybe about ten days before i had to actually get out
so i aint have to deal with the landlord cause hes a jerk
me and my mother drove to newark new jersey
come on lets just go
i hadnt even seen my apartment
i remember i pulled up i unpacked all my shit
kanye baby were here
you know we went to ikea i bought a bed i put the bed together myself
i loaded up all my equipment and the first beat i made was uh heart of the city
and beans was still working on his album at that time so i came up there to baseline it was beans birthday matter of fact and i played like seven beats
and you know i guess he was in the zone he already had the beats that he wanted i had did nothing like it already at that time
but then jay walked in i remember he had a gucci bucket hat on
i remember it like like it was yesterday
and hip hop said yo play that one beat for him
so i played heart of the city and really i made heart of the city i really wanted to give that beat to dmx
no i think jay gon like this one right here
and i played another beat and i played another beat and i remember that gucci bucket he took it and like put it over his face and made one of them faces like ooh
two days later im in baseline and i seen dame
dame didnt know who i was and i was like yo whats up im kanye
yo you that kid kanye
you that kid that gave all them beats to jay yo this nigga got classics to beats g
yo jay got classics g
you know i aint talkin shit
im like oh shit
and all this time im starstruck man im still thinking bout you know im picturing these niggas on the show the streets is watching im lookin these were superstars in my eyes and they still are you know
so jay came in and he spit all these songs like in one day and in two days
i gotta bring up one thing you know come back to the story
the day i did the cant be life beat on track i remember lenny s he had some louis vuitton sneakers on he think he fly
and hip hop was there i think ty-ty john meneilly a bunch of people
i didnt know all these people at the time they was in the room and i said yo jay i could rap
and i spit this rap that said uh im killin yall niggas on that lyrical shit
mayonnaise colored benz i push miracle whips
and i saw his eyes light up when i said that line
but you know the rest the rap was like real wack and shit so thats all the response he said man that was tight
that that was cool that was hot
that was it you know i aint get no deal then haha
okay fast forward
so blueprint h to the izzo my first hit single
and i just took that proudly built relationships with people my relationship with kweli i think was one of the best ones to ever happen to my career as a rapper
because you know of course later he allowed me to go on tour with him
man yo i appreciate i love him for that
and at this time you know i didnt have a deal i had songs and i had relationships with all these a&amp;rs and they wanted beats from me so theyd call me up id play them some beats
gimme a beat that sound like jay-z you know they dick riders whatever
so ill play them these post-blueprint beats or whatever and then ill play my shit ill
be like yo but i rap too hey i guess they was lookin at me crazy cause you know cause i aint have a jersey on or whatever
everybody out there listen here i played them jesus walks and they didnt sign me
you know what happened it was some a&amp;rs that fucked with me though but then like the heads itd be somebody at the company thatll say naw
like dave lighty fucked with me my nigga mel brought me to a bunch of labels jessica rivera man
man you niggas is stupid if yall dont sign kanye for real
im not gonna say nothin to mess my promotion up
yall niggas is stupid
lets just say i didnt get my deal
the nigga that was behind me i mean he wasnt even a nigga you know
the person who actually kicked everything off was joe 3h from capitol records
he wanted to sign me really bad
we gonna change the game buddy
dame was like yo you got a deal with capitol okay man just make sure its not wack
you gotta make sure its not wack

bulls jacket with his hat broke way off

hypes fightin for hits to heighten they hell

alicia keys tried to talk some sense to them
30 minutes later seems theres no convincing them
what more could you ask for
the international asshole
who complains about what he is owed
and throw a tantrum like he is three years old
you gotta love it though somebody still speaks from his soul
and wouldnt change by the change or the game or the fame 
when he came in the game he made his own lane
now all i need is yall to pronounce my name
its kanye - but some of my plaques - they still say kane
got family in the d kin-folk from motown
back in the chi - them folks aint from motown
life movin too fast i need to slow down
girl aint give me no ass ya need to go down

diamonds are forever forever forever
my father ben said i need jesus
so he took me to church and let the water wash over my ceaser
diamonds are forever forever forever
the preacher said we need leaders
right then my body got still like a paraplegic

you know who you can call you gotta best believe it
the roc stand tall and you would never believe it
take your diamonds and throw em up like you bulimic
yea the beat cold but the flow is anemic
after debris settles and the dust get swept off
big k pick up where young hov left off
right when magazines wrote kanye west off

at least you can brag to ya friends back at the gig
but he got me out me out my momma crib
then he help me get my momma a crib

my big brother was bigs brother
used to be dame and biggs brother
who was hip hop brother who was no id friend
no id my mentor now let the story begin begin
let the story begin
let the story begin
if you feel the way i feel why dont you wave your hands

fresh off the plane im off to baseline
nothing handed out im bout to take mine
round the same time of that blueprint 1
and these beats in my pocket was that blueprint for him
id play my little songs in that old back room
hed bob his head and say damn oh thats you
but by the black album i was blacking out
partyin sobs and we had packed a crowd
big brother got his show up at madison square
and im like yeah yeah we gon be there but
not only did i not get a chance to spit it
carline told me i could buy two tickets
i guess big brother was thinkin a little different
and kept little brother at bay at a distance
but everything that i felt was more bogus
only made me more focused only wrote more potent
only thing i wanna know is why i get looked over
i guess ill understand when i get more older
big brother saw me at the bottom of the totem
now im on the top and everybody on the scrotum

my big brother was bigs brother
used to be dame and biggs brother
who was hip hop brother who was no id friend
no id my mentor now let the story begin begin
let the story begin
if you feel the way i feel why dont you wave your hands

have you ever walked in the shadow of a giant
not only a client the presidito hola hovito
the game gettin foul so heres a free throw
i was always on the other side of the peephole
then i dropped jesus walks now im on the steeple
and we know new jack city got to keep my brother
but to be number one imma beat my brother
on that diamonds remix i swore i spazzed
then my big brother came through and kicked my ass
sibling rivalry only i could see
it was the pride in me that was drivin me
at the grammys i said i inspired me
but my big brother who i always tried to be
when i kicked a flow it like pick-and-roll
cause even if he gave me the rock its give-and-go
i guess beanies style was more of a slam dunk
but my shit was more like a finger roll
but i had them singles though
and them hoes at the show gonna mingle yo heh yall know
i told jay i did a song with coldplay
next thing i know he got a song with coldplay
back in my mind im like damn no way
translate español no way jose
then i went and told jay brown
shoulda known that was gonna come back around
shoulda talked to you like a man shoulda told you first
but i told somebody else and thats what made shit worse

my big brother was bigs brother
so heres a few words from ya kid brother
if you admire somebody you should go on head tell em
people never get the flowers while they can still smell em
a idol in my eyes god of the game
heart of the city roc-a-fella chain
never be the same never be another
number one young hov also my big brother

my big brother was bigs brother
used to be dame and biggs brother
who was hip hop brother who was no id friend
no id my mentor and thats where the story ends

toomp killed this shitbittersweet
youre gonna be the death of me
i dont want you but i need you
i love you and hate you at the very same time
bittersweet

see what i want so much should never hurt this bad
never did this before thats what the virgin says
weve been generally warned thats what the surgeon says
god talk to me now this is an emergency

and she claim she only wit me for the currency
you cut me deep bitch cut me like surgery
and i was too proud to admit that it was hurtin me
id never do that to you at least purposely

we breakin up again
we makin up again
but we dont love no more
i guess we fuckin then

have you ever felt you ever want to kill her
and you mix them emotions with tequilla
and you mix that wit a little bad advice
on one of them bad nights yall have a bad fight
and you talkin bout her family her aunts and shit
and she say muhfucka yo mamas a bitch

you know domestic drama and shit all the attitude
ill never hit a girl but ill shake the shit outta you
but ima be the bigger man big pimpin like jigga man
oh i guess i figure its

bittersweet
youre gonna be the death of me
i dont want you but i need you
i love you and hate you at the very same time
bittersweet

see what i want so much should never hurt this bad
never did this before thats what the virgin says
weve been generally warned thats what the surgeon says
god talk to me now this is an emergency

and my nigga said i shouldnt let it worry me
i need to focus on the girls we gettin currently
but ive been thinkin and it got me back to sinkin in
this relationship it even got me back to drinkin

now this hennessey is gonna be the death of me
and i always thought that you havin my child was our destiny
but i cant even vibe wit you sexually
cause every time that i try you will question me

saying you fuckin them girls disrespecting me
you dont see how your lies is affectin me
you dont see how our life was supposed to be
and i never let a nigga get that close to me

and you aint cracked up
to what you was supposed to be
you always gone you always be where them hoes will be
and its the first time she ever spilled her soul to me

bittersweet
i fucked up and i know it g

i guess its bittersweet poetry
i dont want you but i need you
i love you and hate you at the very same time

bittersweet
youre gonna be the death of me
i dont want you but i need you
i love you and hate you at the very same time

see what i want so much should never hurt this bad

that could bring back a piece of real life
real life what does it feel like

i ask you tonight i ask you tonight
what does it feel like i ask you tonight
to live a real life

i just want to be a real boy
they always say kanye he keeps it real boy
pinocchio story is i just want to be a real boy
pinocchio story goes to be a real boy

its funny pinocchio lied
and thats what kept him from it
i tell the truth and i keep runnin
its like im looking for something out there trying to find something

i cant find her no more i cant

the only one that come out on the tour and stay stay stay
back when i was living at home and this was all a big dream
and the fame will be got caught
and the day i moved to la
maybe that was all my fault

all my fault to be a real boy
chasing the american dream
chasing everything we seen
up on the tv screen

and when uh the benz was left
and the clothes was left
and the hoes was left
you talk the hoes to death thinkin the money that the
you spent the doughs to death
and tell me what-tf for real boy

they say kanye you keep it too real boy
perspective and wise man say one day youll find your way
the wise man say youll find your way
the wise man say youll find your way
the wise man saynicki minaj

the watered down one the one you know
was made up centuries ago

not for nothing ive forseen it i dream it
i can feel it slowly dripping away from me
no more chances if you blow this you bogus
i will never ever let you live this down down down

[verse 1]

penitentiary chances the devil dances
and eventually answers to the call of autumn
all of them fallin for the love of ballin
got caught with 30 rocks the cop look like alec baldwin
inter century anthems based off inner city tantrums
based off the way we was branded
face it jerome get more time than brandon
and at the airport they check all through my bag and tell me that its random
but we stay winning this week has been a bad massage
i need a happy ending and a new beginning
and a new fitted and some job opportunities thats lucrative
this the real world homie school finished
they done stole your dreams you dunno who did it
i treat the cash the way the government treats aids
i wont be satisfied til all my niggas get it get it

[kid cudi]

aint no question if i want it i need it
i can feel it slowly drifting away from me
im on the edge so why you playing im saying

[verse 2]

is hip hop just a euphemism for a new religion
the soul music for the slaves that the youth is missing
but this is more than just my road to redemption
malcolm west had the whole nation standing at attention
as long as im in polos smilin they think they got me
but they would try to crack me if they ever see a black me
i thought i chose a field where they couldnt sack me
if a nigga aint running shootin a jump shot running a track meet
but this pimp is at the top of mount olympus
ready for the worlds game this is my olympics
we make em say ho cause the game is so pimpish
choke a south park writer with a fishstick
i insisted to get up off a this dick
and these drugs niggas cant resist it
remind me of when they tried to have ali enlisted
if i ever wasnt the greatest nigga i must have missed it

[kid cudi]

[verse 3]

i need more drinks and less lights
and that american apparel girl in just tights
she told the director she tryna get in a school
he said take them glasses off and get in the pool
its been a while since i watched the tube
cause like a crip said i got way too many blues for any more bad news
i was looking at my resume feeling real fresh today
they rewrite history i dont believe in yesterday
and whats a black beatle anyway a fucking roach
i guess thats why they got me sitting in fucking coach
but god said i need a different approach
cause people is looking at me like im sniffing coke
its not funny anymore try different jokes
tell em hug and kiss my ass x and o
kiss the ring while they at it do my thing while i got it
play strings for the dramatic
and end all of that wack shit
act like i aint had a belt in two classes
i aint got it im going after whoever who has it
im coming after whoever who has it
you blowing up thats good fantastic
that yall its like that yall
i dont really give a fuck about it at all
cause the same people that tried to blackball me
forgot about 2 things my black balls

[chorus kid cudi]

aint no question if i want it i need it
i can feel it slowly drifting away from me
im on the edge so why you playing im saying

no more chances if you blow this you bogus
i will never ever let you live this down down down
 
[verse 4 raekwon]

i know cops hems is lifting lenses
kid armani suits fresh fruits bally boots and benzes
counting up smoking one cuff
live as a red jag a louis bag grabbing a blunt fuck it
steam about a hundred and one ls
kites off the jails buying sweats running up in stetson
nigga hat game was special
it matched every black pair of nikes
throwing dice for decimals
the older head bolder head would train a soldier head
make sure he right in the field not a soldier dead
got made code red
break up the black skunk
the black dutch back of the old shed
if you cant live you dying
you give or buy in
keep it real or keep it moving keep grinding
keep shining to every young man this is a plan
learn from others like your brothers rae and kanye

[kid cudi]

not for nothing ive forseen it i dream it
i can feel it slowly drifting away from me

i never met a bitch that didnt need a little guidance
so i dismiss her past until she disappoints your highness

tony doing time for what he did to nostrils
paranoid mind im still under the watchful
eye of the law aspire for more

when the sun go down its the magic hour the magic hour
and outta all the colours that are still up the skies
you got green on your mind i can see it in your eyes

why you standing there with your face screwed up
dont leave while your hot thats how mase screwed up
throwing shit around the whole place screwed up
maybe i should call mase so that he could pray for us

i hit the jamaican spot at the bar take a seat
i ordered you jerk she said you are what you eat

but tonight you should have seen how quiet the room was

things used to be now they not
anything but us is who we are
disguising ourselves as secret lovers
weve become public enemies
we walk away like strangers in the street
gone for eternity
we erased one another
so far from where we came
with so much of everything how do we leave with nothing
lack of visual empathy equates the meaning of l-o-v-e
hatred and attitude tear us entirely - chloe mitchell

us living as we do upside down 
and the new word to have is revolution 
people dont even want to hear the preacher 
spill or spiel because gods whole card has been thoroughly piqued 
and america is now blood and tears instead of milk and honey 
the youngsters who were programmed to continue 
fucking up woke up one night digging 
paul revere and nat turner as the good guys 
america stripped for bed and we had not all yet closed our eyes
the signs of truth were tattooed across our open ended vagina 
we learned to our amazement untold tale of scandal 
two long centuries buried in the musty vault 
hosed down daily with a gagging perfume 
america was a bastard the illegitimate daughter of the mother country 
whose legs were then spread around the world 
and a rapist known as freedom free doom 
democracy liberty and justice were revolutionary code names 
that preceded the bubbling bubbling bubbling bubbling bubbling 
in the mother countrys crotch
what does webster say about soul
all i want is a good home and a wife
and a children and some food to feed them every night
after all is said and done build a new route to china if theyll have you
who will survive in america
who will survive in america
who will survive in america
who will survive in americacharlie wilson - chorus

cause thats enough money to buy her a few pairs of new airs 
cause her baby daddy dont really care 
she so precious with the peer pressure 
couldnt afford a car so she named her daughter alexis 
she had hair so long that it looked like weave 
then she cut it all off now she look like eve 
and she be dealing with some issues that you cant believe

then i spent $400 bucks on this 
just to be like nigga you aint up on this 
and i cant even go to the grocery store 
with out some ones that are clean and a shirt with a team 
it seems we living the american dream 
but the people highest up got the lowest self esteem 
the prettiest people do the ugliest things 
for the road to the riches and the diamond rings 
we shine because they hate us floss because they degrade us 
we trying to buy back our 40 acres 
and for that paper look how low well stoop 
even if you in a benz you still a nigga in a coup 

[chorus] 

[kanye west] 
i say fuck the police thats how i treat them 
we buy our way out of jail but we cant buy freedom 
we buy a lot of clothes but we dont really need them 
things we buy to cover up whats inside 
cuz they made us hate ourself and love they wealth 
thats why shortys holla where the ballas at 
drug dealers buy jordans crackhead buy crack 
and the white man get paid off of all of that 
but i aint even gonna act holier than thou 
cause fuck it i went to jacob with 25 thou 
before i had a house and ill do it again 
cause i wanna be on 106 and park pushing a benz 
i wanna act ballerific like its all terrific 
i got a couple of past due bills i wont get specific 
i got a problem with spending before i get it 
we all self conscious im just the first to admit it

when you hot im hot
and when your feet cold mines are sizzlin
its plain to see
niggas cant fuck wit me

[kanye west]
get up i get down for my grandfather who took my momma 
made her sit in that seat where white folks aint want us to eat
at the tender age of 6 she was arrested for the sit-ins
and with that in my blood i was born to be different
now niggas cant make it to ballots to chose leadership
but we can make it to jacobs or to the dealership
thats why i hear new music and i just dont be feelin it
racism still alive they just be concealin it 
but i know they dont want me in the damn club
they even make me show id to get up inta sams club
i did deal dirt and went to church to get my hands scrubbed
that why ive baptized these 3 or 4 times
but in the land where niggas praise
yukons and getting paid
its gon take a lot more than coupons to get us saved
like it take a lot more than do-rags to get your way
nothin sad as that day my girl father passed away
so i promise to mr raney im gonna marry your daughter 
and you know i gotta thank you for they way that she was brought up
and i know that you were smiling when you seen the car i bought her
and you sent tears from heaven when you seen my car get balled up but
i cant complain what the accident did to my left eye
cuz look what an accident did to left eye
first aaliyah now romeo must die
i know i got angels watchin me from the other side


when it comes to being true at least true to me
one thing i found one thing i found
oh no youll never let me down
get up i get down
get up i get down
get up i get down
get up i get down
get up i get down
get up i get down

[jivy]
were all here for a reason on a particular path
you dont need a curriculum to know that you are part of the math
cats think im delirious but im so damn serious
thats why i expose my soul to the globe the world
im trying to make it better for these little boys and girls
im not just another individual my spirit is a part of this
thats why i get spiritual but i get my hymns from him
so its not me its he thats lyrical
im not a miracle im a heaven-sent instrument
my rhythmatic regimen navigates melodic notes for your soul and your mental
thats why im instrumental
vibrations is what im into
yeah i need my loot by rent day
but that aint what gives me the heart of kunta kinte
im tryina give us us free like cinque
i cant stop thats why im hot
determination dedication motivation
im talking to you my many inspirations
when i say it i cant let you or self down
if i were on the highest cliff on the highest rift
and you slipped off the side and clenched on to your life in my grip
i would never ever let you down
and when these words are found
let it been known that gods penmanship has been signed with a language called love
thats why my breath is felt by the deaf
and why my words are heard and confined to the ears of the blind
i too dream in color and in rhyme
so i guess im one of a kind in a full house
cuz whenever i open my heart my soul or my mouth
a touch of god rains out

[kanye west]
takeem to church

when it comes to being true at least true to me
one thing i found one thing i found
oh no youll never let me down
get up i get down

now roll out niggaz my hometown niggaz
i get it good in your hood so slow down niggaz
watch the speed though mind the pedal and ease off
a street talk into a collision course with these walls - bam
they dont move dont brake dont lose dont sleep
light passin light fashion life happens that fast party done
black hands up and prayer
black guns up in fear
dyin wish is to touch the air
seekin heaven that wasnt here
eyes will not see another year
its another day
its the same fight
different round sound the bell
mix it up as if youre where you live it up the beat
and get risen up youre knocked down get back and get it up
get off of queer street and get with us
and get clear where we did it
from the heart from the people
from the top from the jeep
from the gutter from the street
from my soul to the mic to the essence
so in my absence you feel the presence exactly
i make contact for sure the emcee
me and mine we dont just get by
we get free and thats ready [mos -- nigga]

[jay-z]
just to get by
nigga i sold coke nigga i pushed lah
carried a fofive
claimed i was ready to die
promised never to cry
held it all inside
reality was too much to take so i
kept my mind fried
slept for most of mine
soon as i closed my eyes
then i woke up behind
thinking either i load up these nines
or blow up with rhymes
cause this flow of mine is like blow up but lines of coca
and your folks think hov just wrote stuff to rhyme
nah im a poster for what happened seein your moms
doin five dollars worth to work just to get a dime
so pardon my disposition
why should i listen to a system that never listened to me
picture me working mcdonalds
id rather pull a mac on you
sorry ms jackson but im packin

[kanye west]
its on im packin weight like nina simone
piano flow
its like a michaelangelo painted a portrait of maya angelou
and gave it to a sick poet for they antidote
if music gets you choked up this is the tree and the rope
this is shy nigga i mista all of that
f**k a map lets put this bitch on the almanac
dice what they hittin for lax what you sittin on
tracks who you spittin on rap till we get it on
and dont let nobody with the power to sign
ever tell you you aint got the power to rhyme
they used to tell me toughen up
put some bass in your voice
they used to tell me lighten up
put some mase in your voice
lord willin i aint killt nobody
but i have a feelin this album
that im gonna make a killin
or not a shillin
this is love it or hate it music
but at least we made it music
and we didnt make it industry
this is gon be interesting
thisll be the end of me or im finna be an entity
kanye jay-z mos def and kweli
we are not makin songs no more
were makin history

[busta rhymes]
back in the days we was used to doin the shit
i cant call it all in the streets
we would hustle and fiends would ask for it
i guess i was used to just standin on corners
waitin for paper bags with bundles of crack
hopin the week was good so i could get money back
to get by just to get by just to get by just to get by
when i was stressed i possessed a side of my strength
that made me angry and bleed
with the frustration havin me smokin newports and weed
to get by just to get by just to get by just to get by
those be the times when i try to rely
on my niggaz and street motherf**kers
and reach out to wifey and then i place a call on my mother
to get by just to get by just to get by just to get by
hey yo mom pick up the phone i g- i gotta to talk to you ma
if you was five percent instead of actin stupid and guessin

and know your math in the building recession to get by

im gonna to get on this tv and put shit down 
i aint finna let these lights skinned niggaz come back in style 
im finna turn to this class clown should be crazy deep 
they told my momma i was bipolar had add 
i told em what-what i wanna do i wanna be a baller 
the dream spoilers are for ya 
hatin on you to they mans on the corners 
old folks said hed never make it off the corner 
they are the virus that corrupts the soul 
they are the cubic zirconia inside the 10 karat gold 
that get green on ya when you get green on em 
you gotta wash ya hands of em get clean on em 
somebody told me success is the best revenge 
so they gon be fucked up when you do ya thing on em 
now hold ya plaques high like who woulda thought 
and tell em ahem thank you for your no support 

they are the dreamkillers they the dreamkillers

they are the dream killer norman bates 

now how you gonna talk about the way i spend my money 
everybody say it with me now its my money 
and they know they hatin but what they dont know is 
they are my motivation they are my inspiration 
cos we the leaders and they the followers 
and we the nut busters and they the swallowers 
they are the rumours they are the lies 
we are the shit dog and they the flies 
how you gon tell me how to live my life 
and you cant even get your own shit tight right 
they are the misery that loves company 
cuz that comfortable corporate job cant comfort me 
told em i finished school and i started my own business 
they said oh you graduated no i decided i was finished 
chasin yall dreams and what you got planned 
now i spit it so hot you got tanned 
and they hate on your relationship then break your marriage up 
cant kill ya dreams so they assassinate your character 
do anything to downplay ya or embarrass ya 
come around wit ya but they aint down wit ya 
they the dreamkillers 

and im through spittin these rappers my most heartfelt flow 
they be like thats cool you got some beats for me though 
oh i get it you wanna be snoop and dr dre 
but dont nobody give a fuck what you got to say 
anyway what you finna rap about 
you never sold crack out ya house or put a gat to a mouth 
or put ya fist to ya spouse so how you gon move the crowd 
i bet a thousand that you get booed out 
i even heard that they even takin wages in jail 
they bet ten boxes of cigarettes that im finna fail 
second you talk about me they be like peace 
this nigga came from the chi moved to the east 
you gotta kill at least one person at least 
or well evict you from the rap game cancel your lease 
how you go to new york what you aint never took a tour there 
what you aint know you gotta be rich just to be poor there 
the dreamkillers

there must be more good women than men percentage wise
so her chance of having a husband just minimize
thats why a lot of girls claim they aint into guys
and mess with other girls part time to improvise
i knew she wouldnt vibrate
no i seen her inner eyes
but im like any other guy trying to get in her thighs
she telling me about how black people should enterprise
and im like if you dont get your ass in this ride from enterprise
that i rented yesterday and gotta have in by 5
with the gas fully filled up like i didnt drive
told her i had a girl nah i didnt lie
told her this rap game is alright im just getting by
she had a lil weed and we get a lil high
and im looking in her eyes and im loving her vibrate
told me back in 95 she fell in love with the tribe
boo back in 92 i was just like you
please dont be confused by the ice and jewels
im like any other guy buy ice to stay cool
like any other kid that claim they hate school
and think yeah frees banging but shes no rachel

[chorus]2x
we ball til we fall
hit the mall
after we
hit dont call
we fill your lives
with nothing but lies
and i would like to
apologize

but you cant stand right here
and tell me everything is going to be alright
cause until the day a real man stands up
im going to have to improvise

[verse 2]
was it something i did wrong
yeah i know im wrong
shes at home alone and im always gone
hate it when she mad but more when she passive
now she on the internet looking for classes
out of state though man that hurt yo
but i got work though and im at work yo
and she dont call a lot
and when she do she pouring out her heart
you never listen to me then the call drop hmm
and i promised her everything
told her when i get a deal ill get her a wedding ring
but when i got my deal i was back in the ring
fighting my urges strip club splurges
never had money so i feel like a virgin
and im trying to break the banks cherry
trying to see can i afford canaries
with a ferrari and a dinner date with halle berry
when from 50 gs to fifteen hundred in a week

i guess theres more good women than men percentage wise
so her chance of having a husband just minimize
i guess thats why she says she aint into guys
and focus on school full-time to improvise

but i took it all back cause god dont like ugly

so now we got bad blood her son is a bad blood

we needed cash
and we need it fast
we broker than ethiopians just tryin to eat at last

i say fuck that dog i get my own way
niggas aint believe me till they see me on tv
and seen k freely gettin head on the freeway
then passin up freeway just like its a relay
we stay 4 stars or better
cause the couches in the rooms got more leather
and we gon flick harder when we could afford better
and back before benzs when we could afford jettas
you still dress ardjo but only pay partial
stay gettin somethin off lay-a-way at marshalls
polo and carbesher we into them things dawg
back in 96 we was livin like kings dawg

they like to act tough she like to tore em off 
and make them straighten up they hat cuz she know they soft 
and when i grew up she showed me how to go downtown 
and at nighttime her face lit up so astounding
i told her in my heart is where shell always be 
she never mess with entertainers cuz they always leave 
she said it feel like you walked and drove on me 
knew i was gang affiliated got on tv and told on me 
i guess thats why last winter she got so cold on me 
she said ye keep makin that platinum and gold for me 
but if you really cared for her 
then you would have never hit the airport and followed your dreams 
sometimes i still talk to her 
but when i talk to her it always seem like she talkin bout me 
she said you left ya kids and they just like you 
they wanna rap and make soul beats just like you 
but they just not you 
and i just got through 
talkin bout what niggas tryin to do just not new 
now everybody got the game figured out all wrong 
i guess you never know what you got till is gone 
i guess thats why im here and i cant come back home 
and guess when i heard that when i was back home

but the people highest up got the lowest self esteem 
the prettiest people do the ugliest things 
for the road to the riches and the diamond rings 
we shine because they hate us floss because they degrade us 
we trying to buy back our 40 acres 
and for that paper look how low well stoop 
even if you in a benz you still a nigga in a coup 

[chorus] 

[kanye west] 
i say fuck the police thats how i treat them 
we buy our way out of jail but we cant buy freedom 
we buy a lot of clothes but we dont really need them 
things we buy to cover up whats inside 
cuz they made us hate ourself and love they wealth 
thats why shortys holla where the ballas at 
drug dealers buy jordans crackhead buy crack 
and the white man get paid off of all of that 
but i aint even gonna act holier than thou 
cause fuck it i went to jacob with 25 thou 
before i had a house and ill do it again 
cause i wanna be on 106 and park pushing a benz 
i wanna act ballerific like its all terrific

the dream spoilers are for ya

everybody say it with me now its my money 
and they know they hatin but what they dont know is 
they are my motivation they are my inspiration

we are the shit dog and they the flies 
how you gon tell me how to live my life 
and you cant even get your own shit tight right

and im through spittin these rappers my most heartfelt flow

or put ya fist to ya spouse so how you gon move the crowd 
i bet a thousand that you get booed out

you gotta kill at least one person at least 
or well evict you from the rap game cancel your lease 
how you go to new york what you aint never took a tour there 
what you aint know you gotta be rich just to be poor there

there must be more good women than men percentage wise
so her chance of having a husband just minimize
thats why a lot of girls claim they aint into guys
and mess with other girls part time to improvise
i knew she wouldnt vibrate
no i seen her inner eyes
but im like any other guy trying to get in her thighs
she telling me about how black people should enterprise
and im like if you dont get your ass in this ride from enterprise
that i rented yesterday and gotta have in by 5
with the gas fully filled up like i didnt drive
told her i had a girl nah i didnt lie
told her this rap game is alright im just getting by
she had a lil weed and we get a lil high
and im looking in her eyes and im loving her vibrate
told me back in 95 she fell in love with the tribe
boo back in 92 i was just like you
please dont be confused by the ice and jewels
im like any other guy buy ice to stay cool
like any other kid that claim they hate school
and think yeah frees banging but shes no rachel

[chorus]2x
we ball til we fall
hit the mall
after we
hit dont call
we fill your lives
with nothing but lies
and i would like to
apologize

but you cant stand right here
and tell me everything is going to be alright
cause until the day a real man stands up
im going to have to improvise

[verse 2]
was it something i did wrong
yeah i know im wrong
shes at home alone and im always gone
hate it when she mad but more when she passive
now she on the internet looking for classes
out of state though man that hurt yo
but i got work though and im at work yo
and she dont call a lot
and when she do she pouring out her heart
you never listen to me then the call drop hmm
and i promised her everything
told her when i get a deal ill get her a wedding ring
but when i got my deal i was back in the ring
fighting my urges strip club splurges
never had money so i feel like a virgin
and im trying to break the banks cherry
trying to see can i afford canaries
with a ferrari and a dinner date with halle berry
when from 50 gs to fifteen hundred in a week
no im trying to callone ringtwo ringsseven ringseight rings
her mother picked up the phone
like she in school and she dont stay here no more
i guess theres more good women than men percentage wise
so her chance of having a husband just minimize
i guess thats why she says she aint into guys
and focus on school full-time to improvise

[chorus]

but the pussy smelled bad so i had to get up out it
so now we got bad blood her son is a bad blood
but it happens in the hood when you inherit that bad blood
and once it get bad it be bad for good
thats bad meaning bad not bad meaning good
but i greet it as good when you leave with the good

now im havin some good nights livin this good life
got me a good girl that im gon make me a good wife
so im good to go and im good where i go
look my man got good aim and thats a good thing to know
and he came home for good off of good behavior

now im good bitch
i aint no kennedy
but im hood rich
so i say my way to thank you to the ghetto
and everybody else thank you very little
i took the road less traveled the unbeaten path
ive been beatin but now broken through the darkest past
its sort of like when king spoke and said we free at last
aint nothin free from that point dawg
we needed cash
and we need it fast
we broker than ethiopians just tryin to eat at last
now all the blacks cookin up that almost white
cause gettin green makes em treat us like we almost white
almost

[chorus]
ive lived
yes ive lived a life thats full
ive traveled each and every highway
what more and whats more than this -

[verse two]
it go my way chi-way
this way or the highway
niggas wanna diss k
on theyre local mix-tapes
there they go again lyin to consumers
get their hair cut in the little shop of rumors
your lil sloppy with your cockiness aint ya
a little arrogant with all your comparisons 
cause as far as the chi
i got the most plaques since the beginnin to rap
but nah yall aint mentionin that
yall just talk about my dough
how i left chicago
how im the only one eatin
shut your pie hole
and wanna figure out why im gettin that high doe
why cause you need fire and im a pyro
and you a parrot you copy what i do and say
only difference between you and me you are gay
ahhhhh did he get his feelings hurt
nahhhh hes got titties under his shirt

[chorus]
ive lived
yes ive lived a life thats full
ive traveled each and every highway
what more and whats more than this -

[verse three]
it go my way chi-way
this way or the highway
when you walk straight niggas tend to look at you sideways
i say fuck that dog i get my own way
niggas aint believe me till they see me on tv
and seen k freely gettin head on the freeway
then passin up freeway just like its a relay
we stay 4 stars or better
cause the couches in the rooms got more leather
and we gon flick harder when we could afford better
and back before benzs when we could afford jettas
you still dress ardjo but only pay partial
stay gettin somethin off lay-a-way at marshalls
polo and carbesher we into them things dawg
back in 96 we was livin like kings dawg
40 cals or better tottin them things dawg
so up the turkish link and take them rings off

[chorus]
ive lived
yes ive lived a life thats full
ive traveled each and every highway

and what i love most she had so much soul 
she said excuse me lil homey i know you dont know me but uh my name is wendy windy and yo i like to blow trees 
and from that point i never blow her off 
niggas come from out of town i like to show her off 
they like to act tough she like to tore em off 
and make them straighten up they hat cuz she know they soft 
and when i grew up she showed me how to go downtown 
and at nighttime her face lit up so astounding
i told her in my heart is where shell always be 
she never mess with entertainers cuz they always leave 
she said it feel like you walked and drove on me 
knew i was gang affiliated got on tv and told on me 
i guess thats why last winter she got so cold on me 
she said ye keep makin that platinum and gold for me 
but if you really cared for her 
then you would have never hit the airport and followed your dreams 
sometimes i still talk to her 
but when i talk to her it always seem like she talkin bout me 
she said you left ya kids and they just like you 
they wanna rap and make soul beats just like you 
but they just not you 
and i just got through 
talkin bout what niggas tryin to do just not new 
now everybody got the game figured out all wrong 
i guess you never know what you got till is gone 
i guess thats why im here and i cant come back home 
and guess when i heard that when i was back home 
in the interviews im representin you makin you proud 
shoot for the stars so if you fall you land on the clouds 
jump in the crowds 
spark ya lighters and wave em around 
if you dont know by now im talkin about chi-town

the concept of school seems so securr 
sophmore three yurr aint picked a carurr 
shes like fuck ill just stay down here and do hair 
cause thats enough money to buy her a few pairs of new airs 
cause her baby daddy dont really care 
she so precious with the peer pressure 
couldnt afford a car so she named her daughter alexis 
she had hair so long that it looked like weave 
then she cut it all off now she look like eve 
and she be dealing with some issues that you cant believe 
single black female addicted to retail

rollies and pashas done drove me crazy 
i cant even pronounce nothing yo pass that versace 
then i spent $400 bucks on this 
just to be like nigga you aint up on this 
and i cant even go to the grocery store 
with out some ones that are clean and a shirt with a team 
it seems we living the american dream 
but the people highest up got the lowest self esteem 
the prettiest people do the ugliest things 
for the road to the riches and the diamond rings 
we shine because they hate us floss because they degrade us 
we trying to buy back our 40 acres 
and for that paper look how low well stoop 
even if you in a benz you still a nigga in a coup 

[chorus] 

[kanye west] 
i say fuck the police thats how i treat them 
we buy our way out of jail but we cant buy freedom 
we buy a lot of clothes but we dont really need them 
things we buy to cover up whats inside 
cuz they made us hate ourself and love they wealth 
thats why shortys holla where the ballas at 
drug dealers buy jordans crackhead buy crack 
and the white man get paid off of all of that 
but i aint even gonna act holier than thou 
cause fuck it i went to jacob with 25 thou 
before i had a house and ill do it again 
cause i wanna be on 106 and park pushing a benz 
i wanna act ballerific like its all terrific
