over-priced in a sam goody frame of mind
got a pouch in the front that holds my cds
and warms my hands when its too breezy

[hook]mapquest where the place is
gats in they faces
then we fold them up and put them back in they cases
assassins replace expressions on faces
and hard eyes on gangsters with hot gaping spaces
hands full of aces pockets on swole
glassy-eyed aiming from my own grassy knoll
leave jfk’s head just a big smoky hole
to console jackie o she could smoke my pole
it’s called camelot ‘cause she came a lot
and a lot of you rappers sound the same a lot
and the game is still out there if you play or not
and i’m the king of queens kevin james is not
i quit my temp job ‘cause i can’t let a day go
tomorrow’s moguls are delivering your bagels
i hope your trophy wife been practicing her kegels
cause when we take the game we won’t leave you any legos
there go the kid with his dirty white sneakers on
dreaming on a way to get his penthouse on bleecker on
give your girl head call you with the speaker on
horse head in your bed now you know who you sleeping on
are you seeing what i’m seeing
this booth is a crime scene
chalk off the mic the kill screen is my screen
no need to terrify or pop shots at witnesses
they only testified they know what hot shit this is

[hook x2 childish gambino]
true assassins
hold your glass up
thems the type of niggas that’ll cut yo ass up
whether it be tracks or verses
chains or purses

[verse 2 nick packard]
classic assassin

i bust through your abode with both barrels blastin’
i crush up your skull like a truck that you crashed in
i’m never gonna die like i’m tuck everlasting
never thought that i’d carry an ak
all i ever wanted to be is farley ferrell or fey
and maybe some day that dream will come true
but for now i got my gun and i’m aiming at you hey
in your house on your couch while you’re readin’
i got no flow it’s more like breakthrough bleedin’
but i’m into cartoons and i’m really not sane
all i leave of your body is a pinky and the brain uh
i’m more manson than a small-time crook
when it comes to taking lives i steal like dane cook
bitch take a look you know it’s in a book
even levar burton’s roots get shook

[verse 3 childish gambino]

i need a second chance like i need a prayer
sometimes i think god just doesnt care
i hope he has a plan for both you and i
so we can be together at a different time

and im not emotional
when i do my work
i get emotional when i order that dessert

and i deserted her
but i refuse to compromise career for a girl
cause this music and this writing and this acting is my soul
and if i let it go thered be no one left to know 
being happy is the goal but greatness is my vision
and all these girls are thinking they compete with my ambition

these guys dont seem like the friends i need

my mom and my dad in the balcony
the one time that i hope they look down on me

they call me a role model
even though my hands glued to that gin bottle

i really cant blame her cause im happier without me 
i dont see what girls are seeing when they say their all about me

i double bag my shit and never cum while im inside her
i used to be a sweet dude now im so angry
look at what these girls and these fake niggas made me
cry when im writing i dont really know why

98 test score in my thundercat folder
my cousin was older
my momma used to wake up 
drive me to a school cause the school was much safer
but i slipped up and accidentally told a teacher
now im going to a school where i get beat up because
i aint get down with them other kids
probably cause i talk too white and i got a dad whos there
momma couldnt take it sold the place and got us out of there
guest room now the six of us splitting one with a restroom
now im going to this school called rock ridge
school of the neighborhood we tryna buy a house in
theres not a lot of black kids

what i wanna know is why i never fit in right
like a fat dude getting on a packed flight
even when i make friends in the hallways
im wishing i was someone else always
but im happy that that shit happened to me
cause it taught me most important is to do me
cause everybody hates you till they love you
facebook niggas same niggas that would shove you
cause nobody was jocking my style
i had a high voice they called me faggot eight mile
so i stopped writing for a very long time
thinkin that a nigga wasnt made to bust rhymes 
and this next part sounds like nonsense
but i swear to god tina fey gave me confidence
taught me everything that is good comes from honesty 
everybodys got a voice you just gotta follow it
she on a role model shit
from the day that i shook her hand
i knew that id never die a broke man
so i could try this rapping shit out again
the game need change im a part of it 
people tell me i should spit under donald glover
but i try to keep my real name undercover
cause if you hear my name then you think its jokes
and i cant go for that nigga hall and oates
my nigga stay down like a winter coat
i rap about my life not im on a boat
cause this joke rap shits gotten out of hand
only ones who do it wells lonely island
save the raps about your cat i am not a fan
leave the joke raps alone man im working here
i do not play around with this bullshit
i am different call it new shit
labels want me to hurry and cash my check in 
but i keep my shit free till the last possible second
cause god knows that i dont need the money
you get your clothes free when you rich aint it funny
but this limelight burn like a motherfuck
i wanna call my dad crying but i hang up
cause i dont want him to worry hes got his own shit
so i send him a check and tell him to hold it
if anything ever happens want you to know this
i always took the time to smell the roses
and wherever i am i am doing fine

playing with this land before time toy from pizza hut
my dad works nights putting on a stone face
hes saving up so we can get our own place

they called me fat nose my mom say you handsome to me
mrs glover maam your son is so advanced
but hes acting up in class and keeps peeing in his pants
and i just wanna fit in but nobody was helping me out
they talking hood shit and i aint know what that was about
cause hood shit and black shit is super different
so im talking hood shit and cool it now like new edition
mom and dad wouldnt listen
they left the bronx so i wouldnt be that
all their friends in ny deal crack
its weird you think that theyd be proud of em
but when you leave the hood they think that you look down on em
the truth is we still struggle on a different plane
7 dollars an hour wic vouchers its all the same
facebook messaging hopin that could patch up shit
but all they get now is can your son read this script

[hook] x2
theres a world we can visit if we go outside
outside outside
we can follow the road
theres a world we can visit if we go outside
outside outside

and my uncle on that stuff that got my grandma shook
drug dealers roughed him up and stole his address book

i used to be the sweet one but things change
and i dont want them missing a son like bones last name
and all my uncles alcoholics shame on me
i drink whiskey till im grounded no tv

and walk in with no id and no id
no matter how far the hood seems

dont bring your girlfriend here its just you 
when im depressed youre someone i run to 
but i guess meet me at pianos 
and cross-fadin off of nanos 
ugh on that hipster shit 
and yous a hipster bitch 
yo but not in the lame way 
like you aint livin out in bk

like your baby daddy aint a dj 
like she listenin to old freeway 
cause everybody listens to biggie but she different 
right thats why your friends need wristbands 
fuck you 
and can i have this dance 

[hook x2] 
[verse 2] 
we could pretend if you want to like 
we in love and started datin after art school 
cause either way we both lyin more than half of the time 
except for when im home workin on your graphic design 
everytime we see each other im takin you home 
our relationship has gotten sylvester stalone 
yellow 9/11 persian girl in the back car 
but me writin a verse the only way they buyin a bar 
white boys used to trip and send me over a gin 
but they busy showin off each other indian friend 
she got ironic tattoos on her back 
that aint ironic bitch i love rugrats 
watchin lames handle they fame 
they bang any broad with bangs 
in a band with an animal name 
hannibal came drinkin a handle of jameson 
anallin anyone is the plan for the evening 
im kidding stop 
girl cryin on ludlow 
she still look good though 
love is eastside who are you to hate 
movie ass not a 10 but a super 8 
you aint see me at the show i was super great 
hotel penthouse go on and let it roominate 
city never sleeps so i guess im never slept on 
did everything i could then i kept goin 

[hook x2] 

[break] 
ooh girl i wanna know 
are you ready to cry cause im no good no good 
ooh girl i wanna try 
im an awful guy and im always away 
and im tryin to say 
imma piece of shit 
believe in this 
im tellin you 
cause we barely knew what we had 
im not that bad the fun we had 
ooh 

[hook x2][chorus]
ooh i want it yeah
whenever you need my help
ill hold you down oh
ooh you want it yeah
when the fuck these niggas
tryin to hold me down

you such a fuckin lame
thats what they used to yell back in 7th grade
my mama said shed get me that new jacket when the cost go down
hit the office stole some tommy hill from lost and found
not bad for a family of foster child
lookin fly man im flossin now

but them niggas saw through me
are you serious what is this
took the jacket off third period
ellipses
listening to sky is the limit on my walkman
thinking if biggie can make it through it
man than i can
dope boy swag i always wanted that
but my persona was always more of that arthur ashe
but no love for the son of a commuter
who was a radiohead 
and okay at the computers at the post office

its funny how you smoke niggas
then you start coffins
all my people need throat lozenge
my fear is dead
ambition drove the hearse
when niggas get to feeling i aint black enough to go to church
culture shock in barber shops cause i aint hood enough
we all look the same to the cops
aint that good enough

the black experience is black and serious
cause being black my experience is no one hearing us
white kids get to wear whatever hat they want
when it comes to black kids one size fits all

[chorus]

we the baddest nigga
we the baddest nigga
yeah we the baddest nigga
we the baddest nigga come on
x 2

the reason that they say im nothing 
but they seen it hurts
the same reason will smith always opposite latino girls
they only see you how they wanna see you
til you make em see you in some other way
im trippin off the other day
cause god knows what these white kids say and do
youre not not racist cause the wires in your netflix queue

subtle racism its hard to pin it
cause youd only understand if you were me for just a minute
this one kid said something that was really bad
he said i wasnt really black because i had a dad
i think thats kinda sad
mostly cause a lot of black kids think they should agree with that
if youre a father you should stick around if you could
cause even if youre bad at it youll get tiger woods
or mj 
we warriors we all need senseis
change everything that we done so far

i dont mean make em bet t-e-r
i mean just the way we see each other
i wont stop until they say james franco
is the white donald glover
yeah these niggas want a cookie
but instead i gave em loch ness
sick boy for life my swag is in the hospice
aimin for the throne
jay and ye said to watch that
they ask me what im doing
and i say im stealin rock back
nigga

[chorus] x 2if we were kids
id want to give you everything that you would want
those other boys
they gave you toys but all they wanna do is

keep up
keep up keep up keep up
thats all i want keep up
keep up with me keep up

keep up

thats all i want keep up
keep up with me keep up

i guess im fucking now im getting used to it
its cause i shine and i aint gotta use a crucifix
fuck the fussing and fighting and arguing to this and that
and why you bein mean to me donald i never texted back

i know its comin quick wishin i could fast forward
tell these nice girls theyre the reason that im an asshole
omega to alpha male because of that dollar bill
when i worked the mail room i aint had a shot in hell

i called her ass for two months and heard shit from her
these girls couldnt care less when the chips under
the chips are up and on my shoulder ya heard me
i take it out on girls who dont even deserve it

the girls i tried to hit last year i still might
karmas a bitch who doesnt suck but i still like
if we were kids i had the black k-swiss and reebok
if we were kids i wouldn’t act like this but we not

and she’s doing coke in front of me but act like i don’t notice

women talk shit on men like all day
but its pete wentz goes both ways

they too busy stabbing hoes like oj
they too busy trapping pros like kobe
the only thing i put before me is do re
if you had told me the truth we’d be ok

if we were kids
id want to give you everything that you would want
those other boys
they gave you toys but all they wanna do is

keep up

this is on a bus back from camp im thirteen and so are you
before i left for camp i imagined it would be me and three or four other dudes i hadnt met yet running around all summer getting into trouble it turned out it would be me and just one girl thats you

and were still at camp as long as were on the bus and not at the pickup point where our parents would be waiting for us were still wearing our orange camp t-shirts we still smell like pine needles i like you and you like me and i more-than-like you but i dont know if you do or dont more-than-like me youve never said

so i havent been saying anything all summer content to enjoy the small miracle of a girl choosing to talk to me and choosing to do so again the next day and so on a girl whos smart and funny and who if i say something dumb for a laugh is willing to say something two or three times as dumb to make me laugh but who also gets weird and wise sometimes in a way i could never be a girl who reads books that no ones assigned to her whose curly brown hair has a line running through it from where she put a tie to hold it up while it was still wet

back in the real world we dont go to the same school and unless one of our families moves to a dramatically different neighborhood we wont go to the same high school so this is kind of it for us unless i say something and it might especially be it for us if i actually do say something

the suns gone down and the bus is quiet a lot of kids are asleep were talking in whispers about a tree we saw at a rest stop that looks like a kid we know and then im like can i tell you something

and all of a sudden im telling you and i keep telling you and it all comes out of me and it keeps coming and your face is there and gone and there and gone as we pass underneath the orange lamps that line the sides of the highway and theres no expression on it and i think just after a point im just talking to lengthen the time where we live in a world where you havent said yes or no yet and regrettably i end up using the word destiny i dont remember in what context doesnt matter

before long im out of stuff to say and you smile and say okay i dont know exactly what you mean by it but it seems vaguely positive and i would leave in order not to spoil the moment but theres nowhere to go because were are on a bus so i pretend like im asleep and before long i really am

i wake up the bus isnt moving anymore the domed lights that line the center aisle are all on i turn and youre not there then again a lot of kids arent in their seats anymore were parked at the pick-up point which is in the parking lot of a methodist church the bus is half empty you might be in your dads car by now your bags and things piled high in the trunk the girls in the back of the bus are shrieking and laughing and taking their sweet time disembarking as i swing my legs out into the aisle to get up off the bus just as one of them reaches my row it used to be our row on our way off

its michelle a girl who got suspended from third grade for a week after throwing rocks at my head adolescence is doing her a ton of favors body-wise she stops and looks down at me and her head is blasted from behind by the dome light so i cant really see her face but i can see her smile and she says one word destiny then her and the girls clogging the aisles behind her all laugh and then she turns and leads 
them off the bus i didnt know you were friends with them

i find my dad in the parking lot he drives me back to our house and camp is over so is summer even though theres two weeks until school starts 

this isnt a story about how girls are evil or how love is bad this is a story about how i learned something and im not saying this thing is true or not im just saying its what i learned

i told you something it was just for you and you told everybody so i learned cut out the middle man make it all for everybody always everybody cant turn around and tell 
everybody everybody already knows i told them

but this means there isnt a place in my life for you or someone like you is it sad sure but its a sadness i chose i wish i could say this was a story about how i got on the bus a boy and got off a man more cynical hardened and mature and shit but thats not true the truth is i got on the bus a boy and i never got off the bus i still havent<span style=padding1em><img alt=trebleclef class= data-image-key=trebleclefpng data-image-name=trebleclefpng height=68 src=http//vignette2wikianocookienet/lyricwiki/images/1/1e/trebleclefpng/revision/latest/scale-to-width/30cb=20090423154754 width=30/></span> instrumentalwhere we were kinda thing

so insecure no ones perfect
we spend it with no shame
we blow that like coltrane
we in here like rogaine
or leave it like cobain

and when im long gone
whole crew sing a swan song
cause we all just ticking time bombs
got a lambo like lebrons mom

and no matter where all of my friends go
emily fam and lorenzo
all of them people my kinfolk
at least i think so

cant tell
cause when them checks clear theyre not here
cause they dont care
its kinda sad but im laughing whatever happens
assassins are stabbed in the back of my cabin

labrador yapping
im glad that it happened i mean it
between us i think theres something special
and if i lose my mental just hold my hand
even if you dont understand hold up

no matter what you say or what you do

till 3005

i had a dream i was flying over all of us
there were so many pretty people
so many pretty faces

i talked to some birds
i fell in love again
and none of this ever ended
everything just kept going and going and going

and even when you laughed you cried
and even when you were sad you were really happy
cause you were here
and i got to meet every star every planet
everything that made me

and we all kissed
and became the same
we became the same
we became the same

who would have thought this
we almost lost it
when you lie inside darkness its hard to see
and we sleep in tradition
keep em off in the distance
to tell you that i havent been

we are all
cold water
why try at all
why bother

just hold me close my darling
just hold me close my darling
just hold me close my darling
just hold me close my darling

who would have dreamed this
you couldnt mean this
it would be some type of meanness to where you are
cause i dont know where to go
and no one else seems to know

we are all
nights fallen
why try at all
dark callin

so were left alone
no one left to call upon
be still now broken bones
as i travel on just hold me close my darling
just hold me close my darling ooh
hold me close my darling
just hold me close my darling ooh

so were left alone
no one left to call upon
be still now broken bones
as i travel on just hold me close my darling
just hold me close my darling
just hold me close my darling oohwhen we were coming down they said it was too soon
i never had to lie no no no no
we were coming down they left us all alone
way to nowhere nowhere i know youve been around
i feel you in and out how are you
do you sleep are you with me
we used to be unspoken
now everything is broken
im a good son
youre a good son
youre a good son

arlanda hotel to the bar
young girl with an accent with her back bent
ass out to the whole world
we can buy it out for tonight
stepping outside for a light
no coke and i just smoke vapor no papers
slow poke and i dont know about photos
lets go though

how old are you
saying that you never date older dudes
why i never wanna say no to you
the coldest dude to hold a grove with no kids
cant hold his goose
ima walk out wanna walk too
what about dude

it took me like five minutes to figure out what voices those were
on the phone but it figured it out

is it real cause youre online
is it real cause youre online
is it real cause youre online
is it real cause youre online

im a freaky bitch
im 5 foot 8 390
and i am a freaky bitch

heathen
its a struggle just to keep breathing
existential asthmatic puff puff pass addict
crafmatic making moves but they sleeping on me
we can kick it like its fifa homie
nevertheless i got that fresh like it was crest
crying cause im stressed tmj or tmi
its a lie that youre living

i never understood the hate on a nigga preference
when every marriage is a same sex marriage
same sex everyday monotonous
lost god never pray forgotten us
lost love never say just like our parents
too much power aint enough power
brain splattered like ive fallen off a watchtower
any anybody can walk into any dennys
and wait until im walking in it with a gun that they 3d printed and i finish it
kinison said if you gonna miss heaven
why do it by two inches
old money and new bitchesi watch them all pass by
the moon and the stars
let me hold you in my arms
forever more

these cold nights
the park is ours
standing by the side
let you go oh to the sea just for me

dont ever let me my love
keep holding on
let the modest go

that a on my chest like a chipmunk

alvin theodore

all night


yeah break free from all of the insides
they godless denied us
but we dont give a damn about the next day
we were never here never know if the world change

common sense the consequences
retweet the tweet then regret the mentions
we are the wireless survivors of things gone
slaves to the unnamed never live long

live and die by the line never know fear
even i wont survive is it unfair
is it unfair cause i dont care
when i step on that ant on the grass

progress the only thing that will last
3005
the year that we fear only god will survive
to be alone is alive

see now i dont wanna see an era an era an era
see now i just wanna live forever and ever
maybe its the last night
maybe its the last night
maybe its the last night
maybe its the last night

see now i dont wanna see an era an era an era
see now i just wanna live forever and ever
maybe its the last night
maybe its the last night

we are the dreams of our parents lost in the future
who hide the deepest desires and wear a mask like a lucha-
door open we were smoking in the hotel
the vapors went through the hallway the manager pissed as hell

i mean wheres the line between donnie g and gambino
he hang with girls like he lena but needed some time to re up
tequila in the cantina thirty dollars i swallowed
the sauce was so malo then she said you need to grow up

you been doing this for too long
that camp was a million years ago sing me a different song
whether youre trolling or controlling just a reminder
you think you get it you dont its the andrew auernheimer

im gone - now im back
give a fuck or give em hell just not a chance to react
tyler durden this burden hurtin they said there was curtains
certain demise look in his eyes the pain inadvertent

i couldve stayed where i was and have a life youd be proud of
but id rather chase things never thought of
it was all love saying go hard
making dope its a trap ackbar backfired

panic dreams so it seems were meant to die
i had to figure it out; its the best no thats a lie
had to get some stuff off my chest i vaporized
high on my own it took time to realize

because the internet mistakes are forever
but if we fuck up on this journey at least were together
man i wish i could go back and tell that kid its make-believe
make em believe in themselves people who needed my help

feelings i felt keeling myself no ones ever been this lost
i just get the information retweeted or say it sucks
i just got the motivation your talents just a bunch of luck
hard work and dedication but lately its run amok

waking up in these places i dont remember
texts from people i never met doors left open
who are you dont do it who are you
i dont know who i am anymore

still on the beat though
still in the game but he moves with a cheat code
slowest connection ever my life inside a computer
them bands thatll make em dance my wallets lollapalooza

the violence first-person shooter
first person to move first person to speak
my mils arent meek they scream in the streets
losing my frame of reference these pieces are shit with breakfast
funny the day you born thats really your death sentence

i met this girl at a dinner we conversating
she beautiful in the face but her voice is truly amazing
plus she write her own shit becoming so close knit
smoke up and talking to eat she helping me focus

no anna nicole smith she getting hers
niggas taking props like a musical live and learn
she say she feel alone all the time im similar
i meet her in my dreams on the moon i visit her

every night i text her i wanna solve the world i think i need your help
she text me how you gon trust somebody when you dont trust yourself
i mean she right though 45 like a light-bulb
and i couldve died like my iphone but i kept going like a psycho
and i took chance like a dice roll dropping jewels like its puberty
wrote a note on the glass you see what these labels do to me

texts said im wet i said hold up wait up a minute
h2o plus my d thats the hood im living in it
never forget this feeling never gonna reach a million
eventually all my followers realize they dont need a leader

stay on your own shit fuck what these clones think
just remember that you the shit but act like it dont stink
we were childish but had to grow up
when you spitting real shit eventually you throw up

realities like allergies im afraid to go nuts
lifes the biggest troll but the joke is on us
yeah the jokes you showed up

youre here now you have to help me
you have to help me
i need you you have to help me
you have to help me
you have to help me

please help me
please help me
please
please help me
please
