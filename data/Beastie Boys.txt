i said i dont know her just met her tonight
and ad-rock started hiding everything in sight

i started playing records she knew all the grooves
he thought she was a thief and d was right
but im just thinkin shed spend the night

when i woke up late in the afternoon

[stop that train]

its 400 am ive got the dr hfuhruhurr ale
ive got nothing to lose so im pissin on the third rail
groggy eyed and fried im headed for the station
d-train ride to coney island vacation

dedicated to the boofers in the back of the 1 train
theyll be kicking out windows high on cocaine
then i jump the turnstyle i lost my last token
riding between the cars pissing smoking

head for the last car fluorescent light blackout
policeman told my homeboy put that crack out
you know you light up when the lights go down
then you read the new york post fulton st downtown

same faces every day but you dont know their names
party people going places on the d-train

trench coat wing tip going to work
and youll be pulling a train like captain kirk
pick pocket gangsters paying their debts
i caught a bullet in the lung from bernie goetz

overworked and underpaid staring at the floor
prostitutes spandex caught in the slide doors
stuck between the stations it seems like an eternity
sweating like sardines in a flophouse fraternity

 fine for disturbing the peace
the neck tortoise your lees are creased
hot cup of coffee and the donuts are dunkin
friday night and jamaica queens funkin

elevated platform never gonna conform
riding over the diner where i always get my toast warm
bust into the conductors booth and busted out rhymes
over the loud speaker about the hard times

sat across from a man readin el diario
riding the train down from el barrio
went from the station straight to orange julius
i bought a hot dog from my man george drakoulias

[year and a day]

mc for what i am and do
the a is for adam and the lyrics; true

so as pray and hope and the message is sent
and i am living in the dreams that i have dreamt
because im down with the three the unstoppable three
me and adam and d were born to mc

and my body and soul and mind are pure
not polluted or diluted or damaged beyond cure
just lyrics from i to you recited
arrested bailed but cuffed and indicted

enter the arena as i take center stage
the lights set low and the night has come of age
take the microphone in hand as that i am a professional
speak my knowledge to the crowd and the ed is special

for i am a bard but not the last one
im my own king and this is my castle
dwell in realms of now but vidi those of the past
seen a glimpse from ahead and i dont think its gonna last
and you can bet your ass

i drop the l when im skiing im smoking and peaking
i put the skis on the roof almost every single weekend
cant stop the mindfuck when its rolling along
cant stop the smooth runnins when the shits running strong

broke my bindings the lion with wings
preaching his word in the b boy sing
i am one with myself as i turn to the
i prefer the dreams to reality

i prefer my life dont need no other mans wife
dont need no crazy lifestyle with stress and strife
but its good to have turn to be a king for a day
or for a week or for a year or for a year in a day
come what may

im fishing in my boat and im fishing for trout
mix the bass ale with the guiness stout
fishing for a line inside my brain
and looking out at the world through my window pane

every day has many colors cuz the glass is stained
everything has changed but remains the same
so once again the mirror raised
and i see myself as clear as day

and i am going to the limits of my ultimate destiny
feeling as though somebody were testing me
he who sees the end from the beginning of time
looking forward through all the ages is was and always shall be
check the prophetic sections of the pages

he goes by the name of disco dave

[hello brooklyn]

hello brooklyn

new york new york its a hell of a town
the bronx is up and im brooklyn down
because they dont know my name they only know my initials
building bombs in the attic for elected officials

i quit my job i cut my hair
i cut my boss because i dont care
you tried to get slick you bust a little chuckle
youre gonna get smacked with my gold finger knuckle

cause being as fly as me is something you never thought of
youll be sticking up old ladies with the hand gun or the sawed-off
like a buffalo soldier im broader than broadway
keep keepin on i dont care what they say

i play my stereo loud it disturbs my neighbors
i want to enjoy the fruits of my labor
cause i am the holder of the 3-pack bonanza
if you open the book then you will get your hand slapped

i am the keeper of the 3-pack bonanza
if you ask a question then you will get the answer
her breast i saw i reached i felt
m-o-n-e-y the belt

i stay at home just like a hermit
i got the jammy but i dont got the permit
yes you got a boyfriend and indeed his name is nick
that is why annabelle youre caught with the shrimpy limp dick

i ride around town cause my ride is fly
i shot a man in brooklyn
just to watch him die

[dropping names]

he thrusts his fists against the post and still insists he sees a ghost
he thrusts his fists against the post and still insists he sees a ghost
shes slippin through his fingers as shes movin out to the coast
he thrusts his fists against the post and still insists he sees a ghost

if your world was all black and if your world was all white
then you wouldnt get much color out of life now right
a nicknamed shamrock my name is not shamus
girlies on the tippy cause my homie is famous

my name is not ohouigheighi nor is it brian
if i said that i was weak you know id be lyin
suckers try to bite they try to pursue it
if you explain to a musician he know it but he cant do it

[lay it on me]

i got chinese eyes and chinese suits
smokin much buddha and smokin much boots
more updated on the hip-hop lingo
my favorite new york knick was hawthorne wingo

met a girl at a party and i gave her my card
man you know that it said napoleon bonaparte
peepin out the colors i be buggin on cezanne
they call me mike d joe blow the lover man

your face turns red as your glass of wine
you spilled on my lyrics as you wasted my time
girl you should be with me you should drop that bum

keep it on and on<span style=padding1em><img alt=trebleclef class= data-image-key=trebleclefpng data-image-name=trebleclefpng height=68 src=http//vignette2wikianocookienet/lyricwiki/images/1/1e/trebleclefpng/revision/latest/scale-to-width/30cb=20090423154754 width=30/></span> instrumentalwell i can hear the trumpets blowing screaming out the end of time
look around and listen and youll see every sign
the waters are polluted as the forests are cut down
bombing and drilling deep below the ground

check the prophecies from around the world
and look around now as it all unfurls
look into yourself and see what goes on
get a feeling in your heart of the right from wrong

because the mother earth needs to be respected
been far from too long that shes been neglected
race against race such a foolish waste
its like cutting off your nose to spite your face

and at the end of the wars what was the cost
its clear that the earth was the one who lost
we are one with her as she is one with us
its unreal how she is treated so unjust

as our planet grows smaller each and every day
everyone affecting everyone in every way
were all citizens of the world community
all here together and were searching for unity

over the years ive grown and changed so much
things i know now years ago i couldnt touch
there are things ive done that i wouldnt do again
but im glad that i did cause ive learned from them

i just try to stay present right here right now
no worries no fears and without any doubts

its about time
its about time
its about time
its about time
its about time

cause in these times these changing times
a transition is occuring and i am not blind
as the pendlum swings a new age we enter
and with every swing it draws closer to the center

yes the storm before the calm and the wars that lead to love
things must run their course so we push and we shove
but were here to work it out in one way or another
to find a mutual respect for ourselves and one another

but the true key is a trust in self
when i trust myself i fear no one else
i took control of my life just as anyone can
i want everyone to see its in the palm of your hand

the past is gone the future yet unborn
but right here and now is where it all goes on
i know we can fix it and its not too late
i give respect to king and his nonviolent ways

i dream and i hope and i wont forget
someday im going to visit on a free tibet
someday im going to see us all joined as one
and it would be too bad to blow it up before were done

cause we long behind the rage learning from the pain
the love behind the tension like the sun behind the rain
im sending loving light to all that is
to all creation and the life we live

im not preaching bull shit just speaking my mind
cause im here now and its about time

its about time
its about time
its about time
its about time
its about timewhen two are served you may begin to eat
     - gene futtermanbecause i grab the microphone and i pick it up
and then i fuck it up and then i turn it in
and then i turn it out got the body rockin sound
and then you know im gonna get down and

eat a scooby snack and take disco nap
because im shopping at sears cause i dont buy at the gap
im sending this one out to all the funky inspirations
pretty purdie on the drums with the beat relations

well im working on rhymes theyre coming line by line
trying to put what i feel into word and rhymes
ive got a feeling coming on ive got to make some shit
a little something stupid for the twisted and sick

because i drive like a maniac on the streets
and i dont give fuck cause ive got the beats
got my nuts swingin from left to right and
right to left and im death defying

i spin my fortune on a wheel like sajak
heres the payback keep going strong like since the way back
i try to be myself but i lose track
cause the shit gets complicated now ive got to get back

as we learn to breed love for one another
in these times of melding cultures
i give respect for whats been borrowed and lent
i know this music comes down from african descent

cause i dont need a magic potion
let me talk about back field in motion
my girls got cheeks for weeks and im happy
you know im a sneak like my old grand pappy

i gotta give thanks to my man archie sheep
for staying true to inspiration and i dont half step
so i kick out the jams and tell you who i am
and i talk to the people like les mccann

i ask god for a rhyme or two
a little something for the wise as well as the fool
a little something to affect a little taste of change
for the together and the strong as well as the dearanged

cause ill do you right like bobby knight
and then im rapping on the mic to the broadway light
stomp my hands i clap my feet and
im bugging off yusef lateef

i got a match to my ass and im a keep it lit
i need to get some cash call my accountant britt
im rushing around town taking care of my functions
always got one more thing so forget about function

we create this world and the problems go on
create our lives and the things that gor wrong
so to the deaf the blind look around and listen
to what it is you want and for what youre wishing<span style=padding1em><img alt=trebleclef class= data-image-key=trebleclefpng data-image-name=trebleclefpng height=68 src=http//vignette2wikianocookienet/lyricwiki/images/1/1e/trebleclefpng/revision/latest/scale-to-width/30cb=20090423154754 width=30/></span> instrumentalso so so just sit back and max and relax
off the tracks that i kick come on and give it up cause
i get funky like diaper rash and
you know im mad spunky and im makin cash

ive got sex rhymes like victoria got secrets
to all you porn peepers who are trying to peep this
im like al goldstein im all about screwin
lead my team to sixty wins like my man pat ewing

like gettin shot out the barrel of a wave
like a virgin pow on the peaks of ak
like a sound that goes the depths of the soul
thats the feelin that i make my goal

uh
check it out

a little wine with my dinner so im in my grape ape
i feel like a winner when i make a mix tape
cause i get ill when im on the pause button
and i get my fill and now you cant say nothin

more soul on this train than don cornelious
i got the mad subwoofer pumpin bass for your anus
just gettin on the mic at the monthly function
wires hittin switches connectin at the junction

pearlmans got beats and it aint no secret
dante found his shit and you know he freaked it
and so the story goes on and on
down in sd 50 till early morninlike the black birds im a do it fluid
building rhymes like buildings like a stonehenge druid
step up and get enlightened educating my mind
i play the tape forward its not time to rewind

step inside the mother fucker and i get my flow on
almalgamate my style so i got something to grow on
seasons change when it comes their time
falls brings the winter and on back to springtime

well its the king ad rock and thats who i am
listen all of yall im not the son of sam
cause im thin and i dont grin 
but check it out people cause i love to go and swim

caught up on the phone fiber optic distraction
information super highway got the brain contraction
im the kung fu master vs the sumo wrestler
got the beats in manhatten you can hear in westchester

well my mother was born out in coney island
raised on the les manhatten island
my dad came out from detroit and they had me
and back on through ellis island goes through the family tree

well im a 67 on the richter scale
ive got rhymes galore and yo i never fail
like gravy on potatos luke to darth vader
im a souped up sucker and ill see you all later

you see me coming down the block with the funky cuts
you say yeah mike d and i say mic deez nuts
ive got attractions like im elvis costello
adam yauch grab the mic cause you know youre my fellow

well when i get it into the zone
im gonna take it to a place where its all one
my shit is on and the rhyme styles kicking
my brain is flowing honest like abe lincoln

cause im the fuckin rythm ace with the rhyme selection
listen all yall im rappin perfection
because i got the mother fuckin old school flavor
that you savor so watch your behavior

talking other dimensions levels higher
why did billy joel say we didnt start the fire
take you to another realm another level
ive got the funky rhymes but im not the funky devil

i step from minute to minute lifetime to lifetime
step from stage to stage to see it all unwind
slowly but surely i seek to find my mind
and every wall that i face is ow my own design

yeah glendale boulevard boulevard
glendale boulevard is where im at
its where im at where i live
check it check it out because my head is like a sieve
and we turn it out<span style=padding1em><img alt=trebleclef class= data-image-key=trebleclefpng data-image-name=trebleclefpng height=68 src=http//vignette2wikianocookienet/lyricwiki/images/1/1e/trebleclefpng/revision/latest/scale-to-width/30cb=20090423154754 width=30/></span> instrumentaldrink a six pack and then you play some ball
walking down the stairs and then he starts to fall
add on two joints and then he starts to sweat
two hundred seventy five pounds that you cant forget

heart attack heart attack man
spend all your money on your health insurance plan
heart attack heart attack man
keep on getting bigger because you know that you can

why do you force yourself on top of that girl
laugh with all your buddies because its a mans mans world
someday that shit will come back to you
youve been throwing your weight around and
your shit is through

heart attack heart attack man
going nowhere you got no master plan
heart attack heart attack man

weighs in at two seventy five
my man is lucky to be alive
smokin and drinkin too
my man the heart attack man is gonna be running over you
got no god damn respect
had to put the big big bitch in check

heart attack heart attack man
lungs full of tar and a stomach full of spam
heart attack heart attack man
time to change your ways heart attack mani dont get blind most of the time i dont drink wine
i took a sledge hammer and i broke my nine
because my life is mine word is born i rhyme
and everey day i write the book down line by line
im feeling good when i do it like this
so come on and turn it up because you cant resist

because im back with another track wich you lack
cause things is wack and thats a fact
because im on time youre shouting rewind
you know its ad rock thats blowing your mind
my shit is rough and you know it is so damn tough

im getting intense not talking nonsese
i made up my mind not sitting on the fence
i dont always know the right from the wrong
i do my best to figure it out and work it out in the long
i try to do a lot more than i can chew
balance out my ambitions what ive got to do

because you hide in broad day light a parasite
a hypocrite you take a peek quick
you turn your nose up you think youre high up
you play it real safe and now your shits fake
i seen you hawking and then you clock my style
and then you try to play it off like you think youre wild

diy that means do it yourself
dont sit around waiting for someones help
i dont sit back and say good enough
i keep on striving reinventing but keeping it off the cuff
so kick the level up cuhootnified
mackadocius vibes positively fortified

im throwing rhymes kicking them downtown
traveling high speed through the underground
i kick it free style make it worth your while
ive got shelves of rhymes that i keep on file
im feeling good now back home again
new york city is the city that i feel at home in

a blast from the grasshoff awhile its been
stepping into the future again
im straight from the 88 to 93 to 94 im out the door
step into the party with the fila fresh gear
people looking at me like i was david koresh here
kicking rhymes from the heart cause thats where im at
fuck the bullshit be it far from me to pop that

in the search for truth i go a lot of ways
theres not a lot of peace that i find these days
i try to stay cool i try to stay calm
but my life is getting hectic like a smoke bomb
so ill say it like the group huggy bear
theres a boy-grrrl revolution of wich you should be aware

you cant dis me it aint worth it b
you put yourself down and you dont even see
cause i dont play that i know who i am
for a minute i didnt but now im back again
im feeling strong see trust myself g
well i stopped smoking cheeba
and that was part of the key

weve got fire we need water so i guess i ought to
leave you broke in a comatose state of mind
and im blind and im working overtime so check it
i keep my rhymes in a little black book
and i know you want to take another look<span style=padding1em><img alt=trebleclef class= data-image-key=trebleclefpng data-image-name=trebleclefpng height=68 src=http//vignette2wikianocookienet/lyricwiki/images/1/1e/trebleclefpng/revision/latest/scale-to-width/30cb=20090423154754 width=30/></span> instrumentalas i develop the awakened mind
i praise the buddhas as they shine
i bow before you as i travel my path
to join your ranks i make my full time task

for the sake of all beings i seek
the enlightened mind that i know ill reap
respect to shantideva and all the others
who brought down the dharma for the sisters and brothers

i give thanks for this world as a place to learn
and for this human body that i know ive earned
and my deepest thanks to all sentient beings
for without them there would be no place to learn what im seeing

theres nothing here thats not been said before
but i put it down now so that ill be sure
to solidify my own views
and ill be glad if it helps anyone else out too

if others disrespect me and give my flack
ill stop and think before i react
knowing that theyre going through insecure stages
ill take the opportunity to exercise patience

ill see it as a chance to help the other person
nip it in the bud before it can worsen
a chance for me to be strong and sure
as i think on the buddhas who have come before

as i praise and respect the good theyve done
knowing only love can conquer hate in every situation
we need other people in order to create
the circumstances for the learning that were here to generate

situations that bring up our deepest fears
so that we can work to release them until theyve cleared
therefore it only make sense
to thank our enemies despite their intent

the bodhisattva path is one of power and strength
a strength from within to go the length
seeing others are as important as myself
i strive for a happiness of mental wealth

with the interconnectedness that we share as one
every action that we take affects everyone
so in deciding for what a situation calls
there is a path for the good of all

i try to make my every action for that highest good
with the altruistic wish to achieve buddahood
so i pledge here before everyone whos listening
to make my every action for the good of all beings

for the rest of my lifetimes and 
even beyond i vow to do my best to do no harm
and in times of doubt i can think on the dharma
and the enlightened ones whove graduated samsara<span style=padding1em><img alt=trebleclef class= data-image-key=trebleclefpng data-image-name=trebleclefpng height=68 src=http//vignette2wikianocookienet/lyricwiki/images/1/1e/trebleclefpng/revision/latest/scale-to-width/30cb=20090423154754 width=30/></span> instrumentalegg raid on mojo

come on baby light my fire 
come on baby light my fire 
try to set the night on fire 
come on baby light my fire 
come on baby light my fire 
try to set the night on firewell its 50 cups of coffee and you know its on
i move the crowd to the break of break of dawn
cant rock the house without the party people
cause when were gettin down we are all equal

theres no better or worse between you and me
but i rock the mic so viciously
i like pins and needles and words that sting
at the blink of an eye i will do my thing

its like a needle in the cartridge when the record spins
like diggin down deep in the record bins
everybody gettin down make no mistake
nothing sounds quite like an 8-0-8

money makin money money makin manhattan
super disco disco breakin
money makin money money makin manhattan
super disco disco breakin

sometimes i like to brag sometimes im soft spoken
when im in holland i eat the pannenkoeken
i got the spice you bring the sauce
you can kiss my ass you funky boss

now that you got what you want you want more
ill be with the hammer and the nail at your door
well with these funky beats i be goin head huntin
shouts to my peeps let me know if you feel something

i can give you all you need
a little beat for the rhythm and some words to read
let me tell you now thats my favorite shit
and when i got a new rhyme i just say it

money makin money money makin manhattan
super disco disco breakin
money makin money money makin manhattan
super disco disco breakin

is manhattan in the house
is manhattan in the househello

its times like this when i just cant stop
cant wind your body without the body rock
got schemes schematics blueprints on file
you got to have the dreams to make it all worthwhile

so as i take my time and realign
i wonder what it is i hope to find
i dont mean to brag i dont mean to boast
but im intercontinental when i eat french toast

ad rock with the new edition
gettin on down for the year 2000
a slight distraction can get you paid
and when it comes to that type shit i paved the way

b-boys to the early morn
b-girls be rockin on and on
b-girls to the break of dawn
b-boys be rockin on and on

dogs love me cause im crazy sniffable
now i bet you never knew i got the ill peripheral
in your home im cloned im on your headphones
i love it when you spaz out all alone

cause im that fool that broke the key
im unlockable so dont check me
i got weight on my shoulders and things on my mind
the sky is falling and im falling behind

so i synthesize sounds as i patch my brain
insane mind games move quick like flames
so now i wonder how sometimes you never know
who be rockin yall in stere-ere-o
in stere-ere-o in stere-ere-o in stereo

no time like the present to work shit out
thats what we going on and on and on about
im not fakin just makin beats in the dungeon
keep that shit funky cause the odor is pungent

no shame in my game just par for the path
i try to hone my craft because at hands the task
but i find im not playing with a full deck
im up to my neck like toulouse lautrec

all i wanna know is when is checkout time
so i could be in heaven with the rhythm rock rhyme
and when im with my man shadi rock at the gates
well be rockin rhythms over disco breaks

b-boys to the early morn
b-girls be rockin on and on
b-girls to the break of dawn
b-boys be rockin on and on
on and on 
on and on repeats

*hubo una vez un gran rey
que tenia muchas tierras 
un castillo y tambien un amor
hubo una vez un gran rey
que tenia muchas tierras 
un castillo y tambien un amor
hoy el rey
hoy el rey*things get hectic quick
from the satellite dish to your joy stick
its the night of the living cable box
wires coming up from around the block

remote control to change the station
but that wont change your situation
have you seen what i mean
im the little gnome thats in your dreams

so i say this rhyme built by design
to take you beyond space and time
said who is the man making diamonds out of coal
the man pushing buttons on remote control

remote control
remote control

until your backs up against the wall
you never know yourself that much at all
so youve got to share your love with a friend
thats all that youve got left in the end

say living in this city of pure confusion
people mislead by their own illusion
all this action no satisfaction
were all linked together like a chain reaction

play or fold love is bold
what is the future that will unfold
some like it hot others like it cold
but we all want to hold the remote control

remote control
remote control
remote control
remote control

things get hectic quick
all of the sudden im in the thick
too much drama all around
distractions booming in sensuround

like a rainy days earth it wont sit still
sliding on down a hill
sometimes life seems to stall
so never be ungrateful yall

so i got a little something for your pay per view
like don king ive got the crazy hairdo
weve got cameras on mars on space patrol
controlled on earth by remote controlwhat makes you feel
and why you gotta be
like you got the right
to look her up and down
what makes this world
so sick and evil
i know you dont know

what makes you feel
like you got miracle whip appeal
who made you the judge and jury
aint you never heard of privacy
what makes this world
so sick and evil
you figure it outlike a flag at half mast as frames click fast
not a thing will last as past is past
like stacks of thoughts that got played and worn
used over and over till they were tired and torn

like a broken clock that cant tell time
like a thick ass book thats filled with wack rhymes
like a scorching blaze that burned the sand
like a band that planned and planned and planned

and flew down like a raven in the dark of night
and snatched up the worm helpless to fight
and brought it back to the nest singing microphone check
one two one two this is just a test
one two one two this is just a test
one two one two this is just a test

like sand in one hand you cant hold for long
like scheming on a plan that goes all wrong
like fudge and caramel theyre not the same
and its a shame all you talk is game

you act like a diamond waiting to be set
in a gold ring as if i bet
as time goes by in this give and take
as long as i learn i will make mistakes

what do i want what do i need
why do i want it whats in it for me
its the imagery of technology
is what you get is what you see

dont worry your mind
when you give it your best
one two one two this is just a test
one two one two this is just a test
one two one two this is just a testready one
you will do this four times with the left
four with the right
then eight times with both
then repeat

puttin all kinds of shame in the game you got
we keep the party movin to the broad day light
getlive alright

transhypnotic robotic cant stop it
no limits to this style you know you cant lock it
first you mock it rock it and then you stock it
but ive got the styles that are always in the pocket

like a bird floating down on a new york breeze
every thought in the mind is a planted seed
so watch the mind or the thoughts will stack
before you know it theyre boomeranging on back

im the king of boggle there is none higher
i get 11 points off the word quagmire
fools cant see me and thats how it is
and thats how i like it cause thats my biz

beatsie beatsie boys gettin live on the spot
puttin all kinds of shame in the game you got
we keep the party movin to the broad day light
getlive alright

times an illusion as the moments race by
too fast to really grasp though we may try
deny till we die ooh my my
these thoughts that mislead and then multiply

second by second and minute by minute
its like lotto you gotta be in it to win it
shakin mind breakin on their own demise
lies tax to the max and theyll be feelin those vibes

so tell me what you need that you have got
feeding on power will make your blood clot
it starts with the greed and then goes all wrong
thats why we cant all just get along

were all connected like a leggo set
one equaling one together like a croquette
whether we have or have not yet met
well it aint no thing and it aint no sweat

beatsie beatsie boys gettin live on the spot
puttin all kinds of shame in the game you got
we keep the party movin to the broad day light
getlive alright

youre caught in a panic and its rattled your brain
the selfish ways just cant maintain
but these are the breaks when you try to come fake
dont come with the rhymes that you just half baked

im the benihana chef on the sp12
i chop the fuck out the beats left on the shelf
you be like hello nasty where you been
its time you brought the grimy beats out the dungeon

i jumped outside the house with my walkman on
i get so hyped when i hear this song
its gonna keep me happy like all day long
so go and talk shit cause it just makes me strong

dont grease my palm with your filthy cash
multinationals spreading like a rash
i might stick around or i might be a fad
but i wont sell my songs for no tv ad

beatsie beatsie boys gettin live on the spot
puttin all kinds of shame in the game you got
we keep the party movin to the broad day light

juniorim flowing prose to cons and cons to pros
im scheming rhyme against reason like it was flow against know
but beyond the concepts and emotions that rise
to the interconnectedness that underlies

the lies upon lies have lost their meaning
the plies upon plies of consciousness that is being
over and over i fall i learned to walk from a crawl
its not sad its just the way and the purpose of it all

now every word that you heard that i said that you felt
was put in place in the space as they were shuffled and dealt
i steal feels from reels but i pay my respects
paying compliments and disses and deciphering affects

words are water as i court her as she is pristine
words and mics fall to dust and all thats left is the feelings
i give in and i win i try to never complain
intentions venture to center and then they set the stage

but ill remain sane making gain without pain
staining trains with names and driving lanes to the refrain
and keep it positive as painstaking as it is
ill never turn back cause thats the way ive got to live
never turn back cause thats the way ive got to live
never turn back cause thats the way ive got to live

so like a cloud carries rain im gonna carry my rhyme
coming like thunder with lightening timing
no hesitation in gestation of thoughts and plans
ferment time like wine no ploys or scams

like the islands dot the oceans in the endless seas
ideas coming to me in answer to my pleas
woke up this morning right out of a dream
reached for my pen and pad because my mind was on a rhyme scheme

what can i do with these bones and flesh
with these animated thoughts in a world repressed
im going down like the rhythms on the winds of change
im keeping calm under pressure like a deep-sea range

im flowing prose to cons and cons to pros
im like toucan sam when i follow my nose
im giving shouts to gandhi garvy and king
his holiness and all enlightened beings

ill be the one who screams it on the microphone
ill be the one who brings it inside your home
but the words aint mine i just pass em along
for betty williams and her friends i sing this song

and more ink from my pen and more tears from my eyes
and more crimes are committed as i say these linesonce again im all wrapped up in me
my best friends my own worst enemy
electricity and gravity

oh my god now take a look at me
my life lines run by at&amp;t
they got their wires all up in me
is push and pull the way its got to be

once again im all wrapped up in me
my best friends my own worst enemy
electricity and gravity

once again im all wrapped up in me
once again im all wrapped up in me
once again im all wrapped up in me
once again im all wrapped up in me

yall gather round to hear my golden voice
cause when its time to rhyme you know i get nice

so watch your back when he takes the stage
or hell send you off on a naked rampage

three mcs and one dj

its like that yall
its like that yall
its like that yall

its like that yall
its like that yall
its like that yall
its like that yall

movin onim hypnotized by youwhats pleasing to the eye
in the delusion of all my sight
is not what i find when i reach into the light
i have lost my mind

im walking through time
deluded as the next guy
pretending and hoping to find
that distant peace of mind

i dont know
who does know
there is no
where to go

its not so simple as i try to wish
but then again what is
there is no other worthy quest
so on i go

i dont know
who does know
there is no
where to go

i dont know
who does know
where to go
i dont know
i dont know
i dont know
i dont knowbet youre wonderin whats been goin on
bet you think ive almost lost my mind

my djs got the cuts and the beats are on
were comin with the lyrics and were comin strong
and the rhythms on time to every word and rhyme
when it comes to keep it real i keep it really raw

at the risk of sounding crass i would like to mention
that im well aware of your wack intentions
to usurp my prose you so and so
its my primary bone of contention

i tell you everybody ive had it
with all these people with static
ill go insane if it dont rain
sucker mcs are problematic

i love it when you hit those switches
a curve balls what my pitch is
so here we here we come like dum ditty dum
i keep all five boroughs in stitches

the sound sounds sweeter through the echoplex
itll spin you around and throw you in a hex
until you feel no pain inside your brain
all your worries are soothed by the sound effects

read it in the post and the daily news
listen everybody lets show improve
dont let me begin about heroin
living six feet deep just aint the move

were giving you soul power
i like it sweet and sour
when it comes to rhymes and beat designs
im at the control tower

tell me what makes you so afraid
of all those people you say you hate
just give it one time for your mind
and lets try to negotiate

lets try to negotiate
oh lets try to negotiatewords comin forth like water from the tap
clap tracks line the spaces places papers people stack
back track through the minutes when the thoughts went insane
i pulled the picture off the cover and blew out the mind games

people say this is the playlist of the void non-bound
but i can say this is the plainness of the peace ive found
its not the sorrow or the pity that we hope to dismantle
its the cast of past dice lighting both ends of the candles

scandelescent in the means i have dreamed on the schemes
reunited in the times of such picturesque scenes
can i get a witness to testify
open your eyes realize electrify

so i plan and i scam and write it off on my taxes
its times like these ill just go with the decisions of the masses
and to the crowds whove come before with their profit massing ways
i took the greed that fucked it up and brought it down to today

with pain i stand sane and remain holding strong
whilst all around me those who clowned me are now drowning by the throngs
its illogical the actions that are typically displayed
a set back aint all that much problem to invade

so i will glow like a lantern on a new moon night
ill fight violence with these hands that werent built to fight
but like a furnace burning coal my goals are bound to burn in flames
whether achieved or dismantled by the agendas displayed

can i get a witness to testify
open your eyes realize electrifysomething on the windowsill
caught her eye and held her still
the cars pass by outside
nowhere left to hide

picture this now crystal clear
nothing left to hold her here
and creeping up meanwhile
traces of a smile

something on the windowsill
caught her eye and held her still
the cars pass by outside
eyes open wide to see if i could fly

eyes open wide to see if i could fly

something on the windowsill
something on the windowsillgoin off the hook like latrell spreewell
ive got the ill technique so you know me fe well

well ice is cold and fire is hot

i went inside the deli and my mans like what

transhypnotic robotic cant stop it
no limits to this style you know you cant lock it
first you mock it rock it and then you stock it
but ive got the styles that are always in the pocket

like a bird floating down on a new york breeze
every thought in the mind is a planted seed
so watch the mind or the thoughts will stack
before you know it theyre boomeranging on back

im the king of boggle there is none higher
i get 11 points off the word quagmire
fools cant see me and thats how it is
and thats how i like it cause thats my biz

puttin all kinds of shame in the game you got
we keep the party movin to the broad day light

times an illusion as the moments race by
too fast to really grasp though we may try
deny till we die ooh my my
these thoughts that mislead and then multiply

second by second and minute by minute
its like lotto you gotta be in it to win it
shakin mind breakin on their own demise
lies tax to the max and theyll be feelin those vibes

so tell me what you need that you have got
feeding on power will make your blood clot
it starts with the greed and then goes all wrong
thats why we cant all just get along

were all connected like a leggo set
one equaling one together like a croquette
whether we have or have not yet met
well it aint no thing and it aint no sweat

beatsie beatsie boys gettin live on the spot
puttin all kinds of shame in the game you got
we keep the party movin to the broad day light
getlive alright

youre caught in a panic and its rattled your brain
the selfish ways just cant maintain
but these are the breaks when you try to come fake
dont come with the rhymes that you just half baked

im the benihana chef on the sp12
i chop the fuck out the beats left on the shelf
you be like hello nasty where you been
its time you brought the grimy beats out the dungeon

i jumped outside the house with my walkman on
i get so hyped when i hear this song
its gonna keep me happy like all day long
so go and talk shit cause it just makes me strong

dont grease my palm with your filthy cash
multinationals spreading like a rash
i might stick around or i might be a fad
but i wont sell my songs for no tv ad

someday
we shall
all be
one

*why fight yourself*
this one is called rectify

theres something coming to the surface
theres fire all around
but this is all illusion

ive seen better days than this one
ive seen better nights than this one
tension is rebuilding
somethings got to give
somethings got to give

someday
we shall
all be
one

*jesus christ were nice*as i develop the awakened mind
i praise the buddhas as they shine
i bow before you as i travel my path
to join your ranks i make my full time task

for the sake of all beings i seek
the enlightened mind that i know ill reap
respect to shantideva and all the others
who brought down the dharma for the sisters and brothers

i give thanks for this world as a place to learn
and for this human body that i know ive earned
and my deepest thanks to all sentient beings
for without them there would be no place to learn what im seeing

theres nothing here thats not been said before
but i put it down now so that ill be sure
to solidify my own views
and ill be glad if it helps anyone else out too

if others disrespect me and give my flack
ill stop and think before i react
knowing that theyre going through insecure stages
ill take the opportunity to exercise patience

ill see it as a chance to help the other person
nip it in the bud before it can worsen
a chance for me to be strong and sure
as i think on the buddhas who have come before

as i praise and respect the good theyve done
knowing only love can conquer hate in every situation
we need other people in order to create
the circumstances for the learning that were here to generate

situations that bring up our deepest fears
so that we can work to release them until theyve cleared
therefore it only make sense
to thank our enemies despite their intent

the bodhisattva path is one of power and strength
a strength from within to go the length
seeing others are as important as myself
i strive for a happiness of mental wealth

with the interconnectedness that we share as one
every action that we take affects everyone
so in deciding for what a situation calls
there is a path for the good of all

i try to make my every action for that highest good
with the altruistic wish to achieve buddahood
so i pledge here before everyone whos listening
to make my every action for the good of all beings

for the rest of my lifetimes and 
even beyond i vow to do my best to do no harm
and in times of doubt i can think on the dharma
and the enlightened ones whove graduated samsara<span style=padding1em><img alt=trebleclef class= data-image-key=trebleclefpng data-image-name=trebleclefpng height=68 src=http//vignette2wikianocookienet/lyricwiki/images/1/1e/trebleclefpng/revision/latest/scale-to-width/30cb=20090423154754 width=30/></span> instrumentalwhat makes you feel

vicious circle of reality since the day you were born
and we love the hot butter on what the popcorn

ride the wave of fate it dont ride me homes
*being very proud to be an mc*

and the man upstairs i hope that he cares

bet you think ive almost lost my mind

my djs got the cuts and the beats are on
were comin with the lyrics and were comin strong
and the rhythms on time to every word and rhyme
when it comes to keep it real i keep it really raw

at the risk of sounding crass i would like to mention
that im well aware of your wack intentions
to usurp my prose you so and so
its my primary bone of contention

i tell you everybody ive had it
with all these people with static
ill go insane if it dont rain
sucker mcs are problematic

i love it when you hit those switches
a curve balls what my pitch is
so here we here we come like dum ditty dum
i keep all five boroughs in stitches

the sound sounds sweeter through the echoplex
itll spin you around and throw you in a hex
until you feel no pain inside your brain
all your worries are soothed by the sound effects

read it in the post and the daily news
listen everybody lets show improve
dont let me begin about heroin
living six feet deep just aint the move

were giving you soul power
i like it sweet and sour
when it comes to rhymes and beat designs
im at the control tower

tell me what makes you so afraid
of all those people you say you hate
just give it one time for your mind
and lets try to negotiate

lets try to negotiate
oh lets try to negotiatei give to this world till ive got nothing to give to
i give thanks to this world for the life that ive lived through
stress gets in the way of the shit that were doing
well bum rush the door if you dont let the whole crew in

my minds caught up in the shit the mans dealing
looking ahead the next level were gonna take it to
i guess i should be happy its a day that we made it through

her final decision is perfection and precision
shes grade a class number one in her division
cuz shes on it

even when im chillin she acts retarded
its gets annoying  so high on the tip
if a pirate had a def jam shirt shed be hard on his ship
cuz shes on it
cuz shes on it
cold chillin in the spot and she wont stop
shell do whats best just to reach the top
she studies real hard all night shell cram
in school she majors in advanced def jam
cuz shes on it
cuz shes on it
cuz shes on it
cuz shes on it
cuz shes on it
cuz shes on it
shes cold in the winter and cool like ice 
sometimes she gets loose sometimes she gets nice
her heart starts beatin her hands gets clammy
but she used to be stired up now shes on my jamie
cuz shes on it
cuz shes on it
her bedroom eyes they start to twitch
but she wont front cause shes got that itch
shed drop to her knees if id only say please
instead of counting sheep cold counting beasties
cuz shes on it

keep it on and onis the cup half empty – or is the cup half full
does the sun rise at dawn – or does the earth just spin along
or is it all perspective – on how we see the world
how many countless life forms – are on a little ball that twirls

are we intrinsically – separate beings
or could we possibly – be parts of the same thing
water feeds the plants and – the sunshine makes them grow
so how can anyone – be an island on their own

does life make me happy – or does it bring me down
do i have what i need – or do i just want whats around
am i seeing truth – or do i just see wool
well is the cup half empty – or is the cup half fullthings get hectic quick
from the satellite dish to your joy stick
its the night of the living cable box
wires coming up from around the block

remote control to change the station
but that wont change your situation
have you seen what i mean
im the little gnome thats in your dreams

so i say this rhyme built by design
to take you beyond space and time
said who is the man making diamonds out of coal
the man pushing buttons on remote control

remote control
remote control

until your backs up against the wall
you never know yourself that much at all
so youve got to share your love with a friend
thats all that youve got left in the end

say living in this city of pure confusion
people mislead by their own illusion
all this action no satisfaction
were all linked together like a chain reaction

play or fold love is bold
what is the future that will unfold
some like it hot others like it cold
but we all want to hold the remote control

remote control
remote control
remote control
remote control

things get hectic quick
all of the sudden im in the thick
too much drama all around
distractions booming in sensuround

like a rainy days earth it wont sit still
sliding on down a hill
sometimes life seems to stall
so never be ungrateful yall

so i got a little something for your pay per view
like don king ive got the crazy hairdo
weve got cameras on mars on space patrol
controlled on earth by remote controlall aboard track 17 all aboard

yeeehaaw
now this song is dedicated
to all the hard workin pioneers of this country
setting out discovering the west
bringin a railroad to where no man has ever been before

johnny he worked on a railroad
a poundin on iron and steel
workin his way out west now
the only sure things his next meal
america was young
but she was a growin
layin tracks across the prairie
not knowing where theyre going
his mother didnt wanna leave him
but now hes in the west
she said please dont go
but he said if i dont ill never rest
it wasnt always easy
some of the boys died
johnny wrote her letters
but received no replies

johnny he worked on a railroad
a poundin on iron and steel
workin his way out west now

johhny reached san francisco
tired and broke without a dime
started panning for gold
just a hopin he would find
the gold wasnt a rushin
but johnny kept on minin
trying to send his mama something
with the letters he was signing
then one day johnny finally got a reply
when he opened mamas letter
he began to cry
shes a writin from her deathbed
and this is what she said
please dont be mad at me son
ccause tomorrow ill be dead

a poundin on iron and steel

there never was a city kid truer and bluer

and ive got more hits than sadaharu oh

tom thumb tom cushman or tom foolery
date women on tv with the help of chuck woolery
words are flowing out just like the grand canyon
and im always out looking for a female companion

i threw the lasso around the tallest one and dragged her to the crib
i took off her moccasins and put on my bib
im wheelin and dealin i make a little bit of stealing
ill bring you back to the place and your dress im peeling

your bodys on time and your mind is appealing
staring at the cracks up there upon the ceiling
such and such will be the bass that im throwing
im talking to a girl telling her im all knowing well

shes talking to the kid to the kid
im telling her every lie that you know that i never did
hey ladies *a get funky*
*all the ladies in the house*
*the ladies the ladies*

well
me in the corner with a good looking daughter
i dropped my drawers and said welcome back kotter
we was cutting up the rug she started cutting up the carpet
in my apartment i begged her please stop it

the gift of gab is the gift that i have
and that girl aint nothing but a drag
educated no stupid yep
and when i say stupid i mean stupid fresh

im not james at 15 or chachi in charge
im adam and im adamant about living large
with the white sassoons and the looks that kill
makin love in the back of my coupe de ville then

i met a little cutie she was all hopped up on zootie
i liked the little cutie but i kicked her in the bootie
cause i dont kinda go for that messin around
you be listening to my records a number one sound

shell show you a good time then shell show you the door
break up with your girl it ended in tears
vincent van gogh go and mail that ear

call her in the middle of the night when im drinkin
the phone booth on the corner is damp and its stinkin
said come on over it was me that she missed
i threw that trash can through her window cause you know i got dissed

your old lady left you and you went girls girls girls insane
you blew yourself up in the back of the 6 train well
take my advice at any price
a gorilla like your mother is mighty weak man

sucking down pints till i didnt know
woke up in the morning with the one ton ho
cause i announce i like girls that bounce
with the weight that pays about a pound per ounce

girls with curls and big long locks
and beatnik chicks just wearing their smocks
walking high and mighty like shes number one
*she thinks shes the passionate one*

hey ladies *a get funky*
*whats that*

so cold on the mic i make your teeth chatter
while you climb the corporate ladder

we be flipping styles like pancake batter

looking through your binos spying on me
but im running like a rhino on a drinking spree
you call yourself an mc but whats your truth
gotta let it loose inside the toll booth

but your ass drunk like you slipped on a banana
like nick nack patty wack youve got to let it out
from the mind to the mic to the word to a shout

like now see me ill show you up

now you wanna get back when you had your shine
but you run the same thing every time when you rhyme
cant stop wont stop no compromise
its a house of cards built out of lies

coming down like a bird floating on the mist
turn on the track back track and twist
you work hard to climb the list
twenty years of schooling and they put you on the day shift

i know the danger of a man thats danger
whos been to hell and back again danger
cant tell tomorrow from where hes been thats danger
dont play no game that i cant win danger

youre caught now by the skin youre in
in a bind now your thoughts go to all your sins

i tell you what we know always holds us back

now you mutter and you stutter and you putter dont stop
i got in your heart and i shook you up
in a bind now youre caught by the fear setting in
choked on the thought that you dont it again

keep the competition in check
you draft your plans at your drafting desk
you try to play to win but now you lost
like clams with no tartar sauce

wcheming in the attic thought you had it
so dramatic
i got the stats mathematics automatic-systematic
shes super bad now whatcha watcha want now

i know the danger of a man thats danger
whos been to hell and back again danger
cant tell tomorrow from where hes been thats danger
