you talk too much

hey  you over there i know about your kind
youre like the independent network news on channel 9
everywhere that you go no matter where you at
i said you talk about this and you talk about that
when the cat took your tongue i say you took it right back
your mouth is so big one bite would kill a big mac

you talk too much               you never shut up
i said you talk too much        homeboy you never shut up

you talk about people you dont even know
and you talk about places you never go
you talk about your girl from head to toe
i said your mouths moving fast and your brains moving slow

you talk too much               you never shut up
i said you talk too much        homeboy you never shut up

youre the instigator the orator of the town
youre the worst when you converse just a big mouth clown
you talk when youre awake i heard you talk when you sleep
has anyone ever told you that talk is cheap

you talk too much               you never shut up
i said you talk too much        homeboy you never shut up

talking is the one thing that you can do best
you told the cavity creeps to watch out for crest
you never have the story right and exact
and then you always try to bore me with your yakkity yak

you talk too much               and then you never shut up
i said you talk too much        homeboy you never shut up

everyday you are out fighting someone in the street
and youre always fighting someone you know ya cant beat
then you wonder how you got in this mess
just think of what you said then take a guess

you talk too much               you never shut up
i said you talk too much        homeboy you never shut up

youre always spreading rumors whether bad or good
youre the damn walter cronkite of the neighborhood
the barbara walters and the howard cosell
you always come around with a story to tell

you talk too much               and then you never shut up
i said you talk too much        homeboy you never shut up

said its everybodys business that you love to mind
and talkin to you is like dropping a dime
youre spreading the word like it is your job
you should be a stool pigeon who works for the mob

you talk too much               and you never shut up
i said you talk too much        homeboy you never shut up

a big blabbermouth thats what you are
if you were a talk show host youd be a star
i said your mouth is big size extra large
and when you open it its like my garage

you talk too much               and then you never shut up
i said you talk too much        homeboy you never shut up

you always like to gossip just like a girl
you talk so damn much its outta this world
when youre reincarnated in your second life
you wont be a man youll be a nagging wife

you talk too much               then you never shut up
he said you talk too much       homeboy you never shut up

shut up
shut up

twenty-five hours eight days a week
thirteen months outta year is when you speak
im tired of listening to the garbage you talk
why dont you find a short pier and take a long walk

you talk too much               then you never shut up
i said you talk too much        homeboy you never shut up
you talk too much               you could be out of breath
you talk too much               man you naggin me to death
you talk too much               tired of hearing you speak
you talk too much               eight days a week
you talk too much               then you never shut up
i said you talk too much        why dont you ever shut up

need a sip of lemonade im a slave to my trade
from all these lights my complexion might fade
secretary overworked by a money hungry jerk
got a letter answer woman wont you freak out on my shirt

well can you rock it like this         i can rock it like that
can you rock it like this              i can rock it like that

your ears are clogged your head as hard as a log
my privacy robbed let me do my job

youre the reason why my eyes are on the doorknob

can you rock it like this              i think i rock it like that
but can you rock it like this          homeboy i rock it like that

well can you rock it like this         i can rock it like that

but can you rock it like this          i can rock it like that
huh *echoes*

news reporters invade my borders
if i think it i will say it you might have a recorder
and then uhh-ohh the nations in upheaval
old dating always thinking at me evil
youre stepping on my heels youre breathing down my neck
im not rodney dangerfield so give me respect

can you rock it like this              i-i can rock it like that
but can you rock it like this          homeboy i rock it like that

but can you rock it like this          i can rock it like that
hu-huh-huh *echoes*

what it all adds up to is just one thing
run-dmc is the king of the swing
and if you mess with us youll be a real short liver
you may be big but our bodyguards bigger *echoes*

tenement buildings and skyscrapers

[run]
are polluted and often invaded
with troubled hearts and weakened minds
living their lives and hoping to find
the golden key to prosperity
never have a grip on reality
this makes day to day living hard
trumpin your fate never peepin the card
you just goin through life without a trace
when the answers you seek are in front of your face

[both]	youre blind [2x]
[run]	tell em d

[dmc]
youre headed for the top or so you think
but thats not true for you your life is on the brink
of self-destruction total corruption
you better get out or die from consumption
sweat for a dollar to get nothin back
cause at the end of the week you still get taxed
youd even sell your soul to make your life correct
but with the rate of inflation you should eat your check
so you try to make a hustle to get ahead
but the only thing you manage is to stay in the red
coppin from john to sell to rex
and your jones for success has put your life in check

[both]	youre blind [2x]
[run]	and you cant see
[dmc]	you need to wear some glasses
[run]	like dmc
[both]	youre blind

[run]
so you think the facts means you cant win
so you devote your time to a life of sin

[dmc]
hangin out late is how you survive
makin deals talkin jive and tellin lies
pressure beatin you down
[run]	like youre not handlin
and all the while your mind is ramblin
[run]	about bein fly
or even sly
[both]	and bein held low in the public eye
you decide these things but you dont know why
[both]	youre standin on a corner cold playin the post
cause another sucker you were chillin the most

[both]	youre blind [2x]
[run]	yo you cant see
[dmc]	you need to wear some glasses
[run]	like dmc
[both]	youre blind [2x]

[dmc]	
you run round talkin bout what you hate
livin your life just to perpetrate
you think your style is chill because youre always cold
with your platform shoes and your fake gold
[run]	so you think youre bad
sheer dynamite
but if you only knew the crew called you freaks delight

[run]
wearin the tightest jeans and shortest skirt
you think youre cold chillin lookin like a jerk
no matter what you do come out second rate
[dmc]	thinkin youre on time but youre already late
youre blind

[run]	youre blind and you cant see
[dmc]	you need to wear some glasses
[run]	like dmc
[both]	youre blind
[run]	and you cant see
[dmc]	you need to wear some glasses
[run]	like dmc
[both]	youre blind

[dmc]	the moral to the story may not be clear
[run]	and the only way to catch it is to lend an ear
[dmc]	stop frontin so hard
[run]	why dont you peep your card
[dmc]	and your goals in life may not be far
because these words i say are meant for you to hear
so if you bust these facts you will persevere

[both]	youre blind [2x]

travel round the world with my mind at ease
no calvin klein just wearin lees

the top of the chart is where i stay
but i also chill around the way
in hollis queeens is where i stop
on the streets with the beats is where i walk

dmc
when i perform many hearts i warm
im better known as the quiet storm
i dont talk too much but i got beef
when i kill mcs i cause grief
devestating mic control is my main goal
my name is darryl and his name is joe
the master of music his name is jay
leave us alone and let us play
we give it up and turn it loose

{*jam master jay cuts for the rest of the song*}now peter piper picked peppers but run rocked rhymes
humpty dumpty fell down thats his hard time
jack b nimble was nimble and he was quick
but jam master cut faster jacks on jays dick 
now little bo peep cold lost her sheep 
and rip van winkle fell the hell asleep
and alice chillin somewhere in wonderland 
jacks serving jill a bucket in his hand
and jam master jays making out our sound 
the turntables might wobble but they wont fall down

now dr seuss and mother goose both did their thing
but jam masters gettin loose and dmcs the king 
cause hes the adult entertainer child educator
jam master jay king of the crossfader
hes the better of the best best believe hes the baddest
perfect timin when im climbin im a rhymin apparatus
lotta guts when he cuts girls move their butts
his name is jay hear the play he must be nuts
and on the mix real quick and id like to say 
hes not flash but hes fast and his name is jay

it goes a one two three and 

jays like king midas as i was told
everything that he touched would turn to gold
hes the greatest of the great get it straight hes great
claim fame cause his name is known in every state
his name is jay to see him play will make you say 
god damn that dj made my day 
like the butcher the baker the candlestick maker
hes a maker a breaker and a title taker
like the little old lady who lived in a shoe
if cuts were kids he would beat you
im not lying yall hes the best i know
and if i lie my nose will grow 
like the little wooden boy named pinocchio
and you all know how the story goes
tricks are for kids he plays much gigs
hes the big bad wolf and youre the three pigs
hes the big bad wolf in your neighborhood
not bad meaning bad but bad meaning good

there it is 

were run-dmc got a beef to settle 
ds not hansel hes not gretel 
jays a winner not a beginner 
his pocket gets fat while others get thinner 
j-j-jump on jay like cows jump moons

so whats your name dmc the king is me
your highness or his majesty
now you can debate ci ci ci concentrate
but you cant imitate dmc the great

dissin all devils causing havoc in hell
at a very high level bass and treble shall yell
heard in the heaven of a sound supreme
so clear to the ear it is sometimes seen
so loud like a cloud with thunder and lightning
so proud to the crowd it is somewhat frightening
no calm in a storm like a beast unleashed
theres no stoppin cause the rockin cannot cease
break

you see its harder than hard not one bit soft
courageous and contageous so you better break north
not a cold on a roll did you hear me cough
just listen when im dissing cause youre pissin me off
cold bedding is spreading all across your face
you can take when i break and if thats the case
i go on and on and kick the bass
so back up from the cup while i take my taste

its like a praise when the hell is raised
so demanding and commanding that you all stand dazed
the unbelieving receiving prophecies so true
i cut the head off the devil and i throw it at you
my mighty mic control already brought his soul
the rock king is so bold when he rocks and roll
a black cat is my crown symbolizing the sound
signifying we dont mess around
bust it

rappin and climbin beat makin every day
dont synthesize the sound so it sounds when i say
i am great get it straight cause thats my fate
my name is run im number 1
thats how i rate
hes in the place with the bass and styln grace
his name is j hes here to play and with his race
hes off the wall on the ball his name is d
kind of tall yes yall hes down with me

from the mountain valley to the deep blue sea
the word is heard as told by d
i dont sing i bring much delight
like a star shining bright in the darkest night
if you are cold ill bring you heat
like i brought the world my funky beat
mysterious is serious i aint no joke
fire from the depths of hell and you can smell the smoke

kickin and tickin while youre havin a ball
like chicken finger lickin ill be flickn you off
so do the bird have you heard did they give you a call
just me and dmc cold shakin the walls

theres no fearin when hearin sound of this kind
across the land every man is going out of his mind
on the face of the earth spreadin like a disease
contaminating infiltrating like a horde of bees

lord of lyrics duke of discussion
ruler of rock the king of col crushing
ruler of people controller of crowds
lingering lyrics long lasting and loud
left yall ah to the left yall 
because i rock upon the mic real def yall
and to the right yall ah to the right yall 
because i rock upon the mic all night yall

you see i want respect if im correct
theyre all like a ball that i have checked
and the shots they take have no effect
the pope tried to dunk but he broke his neck
cause i rock harder and i get farther
you want to battle d hey please dont bother
to waste your time messin with my rhyme
the only kick youll get out of it is in your behindverse 1

one day when i was chillin in kentucky fried chicken

he gave a quarter and his order small fries big mac

whats the meaning of this  i must be dreaming
everybodys  when i see men dealing
for a rhyme or rope or a dime of coke
sometimes i rhyme when im crying broke
many many many records broke laws broke jaws
a few months ago i had to pause
during that time me and my man
was chilling on the corner with a quart in our hands
a beef broke out at soul kitchen spot
it was crazy baby pop someone got shot
i seen him drop - then came the cops
sayin nobody run - everybody stop
i wanted to run cause i was carryin my gun
darryl mack packin mine strapped with my nine
everyone on the wall thats what the cop said
everyone complied except bald dread he said
blood claat boi me nah hafa deal wit dat

[run]
now on the ave what people steal and they dealin away
i got the feelin the illin will never ever pay
cause on the street youre never in the fast lane
you go to jail or get a bullet in your brain
people laugh and smile at a stick-up
a young man in a rut shakin a big cup
people pass his ass and say tough luck
to waste time for a dime is cold fucked up
a loud shot in the air - not rare
a brother fell to the ground nobody cares
you ask why the baby cry a man laugh
nobody give a damn thats how they livin on the ave
 auuugh

[dmc]
away from the ave they have whats called the backstreets
another world of girls that crawl the backseats
systems that are kickin sinkin many black beats
this and that goin on  street
i remember the time there was a jam in 
 the music no  til after dark
thats when the shit starts happening
brother from the ave this and that again
body move in the back and a quarter in the jar
find the rules by the basketball court in the park
and the  by the bench where the 40 dogs spark
the crowd crowds around like they found noahs ark
the young hung and swung on a swing
glidin and slidin and ride the ding-a-ling
i didnt see a kid by the see so he saw
near the monkey bars funky cars we adore
im throwin fate to the gate  
and my man from japan got vicked for sure
do me a favor when you roll with your crew
you gotta check out check out the avenue[run] i would like to throw rock box in the start of this one

ah to the maximum and keep askin um
when the city gonna fix where the blacks are from
and every day around the way another one got
bucked in his head from a gunshot
no chance in advance for the ambulance
cause he was just another victim of the circumstance
a brother died the mother cried it was a pity
but thats how it goes down when youre livin in the city

just a hard rock call him a hard rock
in the metropolis theres no stoppin this
cant agree with society poppin this
disagree with the plea when they coppin it
some men pretend the end will come soon
they gather what they can and them boom
you played yourself you made your wealth;
the deal was dealt now your health is in question
three card molly hoodlums who are we
pollution prostitution in god we
need a solution revolution substitution
for the things that were abusing
pity the city for the people livin out on the streets
yo we homeless the homeless need to eat
theres no progress for the rest
god bless for less

what it is
whats it all about
whassup g
what it be
how you livin homeless probably mandelas free
and theyre rollin with d
in history you cannot see em like they cannot see me
the berlin wall

they said no but
yo yes whyall
the people that spoke were never provoked
and now its tumblin down
freedom of speech for each
now how that sound
try to stop me from sayin what i want to say
my funky rhyme i never quit until the break of day
now here we go as i flow and show and kick
infor-mation teach and  reach inside the nation
and be a seer cause im reason with run
and now that the point is out
let the jam slam my man and tell me
whats it all about

i flex my muscle what i must do
