food and liquor stores rest on every corner
from 45th and state to the last standing hymn nuhana
j&amp;js harold chicken good finger licking
while they sin gin sin sin at rothschild and kenwood liquors
the winos crooked stagger
meets the high stride of the use searching for the truth
they rebel and raise hell across alleyways and in classroom settings
they get high off that drum bass and 20/20 rims
they rock braids air force ones and timbs
they drink hennessy hypnotiq and 40s
they call they women hoes bust downs and shorties
they keep funeral homes in business and gunshot wards of hospitals full
prisons packed bubbling over in brown sugar
they keep empty westside lots crowded hypes powdered
the well is running dry the days of malcolm and martin have ended
our hope has descended and off to the side
waiting for the reinstallment of the revolution
because we are dying at the cost of our own pollution
but god has another solution that has evolved from the hood
i present one who turns the fiasco to good

hud renovate that section 8 pays for
well lets pray for em
let the beat play for em
put the trouble on display for em
cause he gotta go face the drama
with a difference face from the one that he use to face his momma
if you look close
youll see a consists of a smile that hurts a ice grill
in a trace of trauma
little bit of his father
another criterion thats no difference from a young liberian
who let the delirium worry him living in the inner city
out of his mind
liria reconsilia

and he never lies
and he never lies
uhyea

verse 1
he just sits and watches the people in the boxes
everything he sees he absorbs and adopts it
he mimics and he mocks it
really hates the box but he cant remember how to stop it
uh so he continues to watch it
open that and then give him something that he can box with
or how to locksmith
see the box is locked in a box aint got the combination to unlock it
thats why he wa-tches scared to look away
cause at that moment it might show him
what to take off the locks with
so he chained hisself to the box took a lock and then he locked it
swallowed the combination and then forgot it
as the doctors jot it all down with they pens and pencils
the same ones that took away his voice
and just left his instrumental like that

hook
and he never lies he never lies he never lies uh
and he never lies he never lies he never lies no
and he never lies he never lies
cause he never said anything at all

verse 2
he just sits and listens to the people in the boxes
everything he hears he absorbs and adopts it
anything not coming out the box he blocks it
see he loves the box and hope they never stop it
anything the box tell him to do
he does it anything it tell him to get
he shops and he cops it
he protects the box locks it inna box when he goes to sleep but he never sleeps
cause he stays up to watch it
scared to look away
cause at that moment it might get stolen and thats the last of the boxes
so he chained hisself to the box took a lock and then he locked it
swallowed the combination and forgot it
as the doctors jot it all down with they pens and pencils
the same ones that took away his voice
and just left his instrumental like that

no positive male role model
to play football and build railroad models
its making a hole youve been digging it
cause you aint been kicking it
since he was old enough to hold bottles
wasnt supposed to get introduced to that
he dont deserve to get used to that
now i aint asking you for money or to come back to me
some days it aint sunny but it aint so hard

so he said to him
i want you to be a father

[verse 2]

but i think i like her like a metaphor
its hard to get in the car we sit
from the intro she rolled down her window just in case i was a schizo
i compliment her on the common sense
im calm
a little more confident uh huh
and then we lose consciousness
she says that ive been waitin for you
and i know you been chasin me too since they kidnapped me from a castle
i been thinkin of you
i told a fire breathin dragon he bet not harm me or be sorry when he meets my one man army
and thou has come to rescue me
my knight in shinin armor yes you be
woken up by the horn of an suv
i said see too beautiful to let you sleep

[chorus]

[verse 3]
relationship is just 30 minutes long
its kinda heavy maybe a little strong
go and take much more than once
cant trust what each of us say at least for a month
or two before i bid you adieu

just leave me a few that lead to you
wont be long and i see you in the mornin

unless they sittin on the shoulders but thats way too high
lets try not to step on the children 
the news cameras filmin

and they do drive-bys like up and down the thighs

he came back
in the same suit that he was buried in
similar to the one his grand father was married in
yes he was still fresh to death
bling 2 ear-rings a chain laying on his chest
he still had it cause they couldnt find it
and the bullets from his enemies sat like 2 inches behind it
smell the hennesey from when his niggas got reminded
and poured out liquor in his memory he didnt mind it but
he couldnt sip it fast enough
so the liquor was just filling the casket up
floating down by his feet was the letter from his sister
second grade hand-writing simply read i miss ya
suit jacket pocket held his baby daughters picture
right next to it one of his mans stuck a swisher
he had a notion as he laid there soaking
saw that the latch was broken he kicked his casket open
and he

this life goes passing you by
it might go fast if you lie
you go and you live then you die

o-oh-oh-ohh

if life goes passing you by
dont cry
if you breaking the rules
making your moves
paying your dues
chasing the cool

not at all nervous as he dug to the surface
tarnished gold chain is what he loosened up the earth with
he used his mouth as a shovel to try and hollow it
and when he couldnt dirt spit swallowed it
working like a hmm reverse archaeologist
except his buried treasure was sunshine
so when some shined through a hole that he had drove
it reflected off the gold and almost made son blind
he grabbed on to some grass he climbed
pulled himself up out of his own grave and looked at the time
on the watch that had stopped 6 months after the shots
that had got him in the box wringing henny out his socks
figured it was hours because he wasnt older
used some flowers to brush the dirt up off his shoulders  so
with a right hand that was all bones and no reason to stay
decided to walk home
so he

this life goes passing you by
it might go fast if you lie
you go and you live then you die

o-oh-oh-ohh

if life goes passing you by
dont cry
if you breaking the rules
making your moves
paying your dues
chasing the cool

he begged for some change to get him on a train
damn that nigga stank is what they complained
tried to light the blunt but it burst into flames
caught the reflection in the window of what he became
a long look wasnt shook wasnt ashamed
matter fact only thing on his brain was brains yeah
and getting back in his lane doing his thang
first he had to find something to slang
next stop was his block
it had the same cops
walked right past the same spot where he was shot
shocked that some little niggas tried to sell him rocks
it just felt weird being on the opposite
they figured that he wasnt from there
so they pulled out and robbed him
with the same gun they shot him with
put it to his head and said you scared aint you
he said hustler for death no heaven for a gangsta 

this life goes passing you by
it might go fast if you lie
you go and you live then you die

o-oh-oh-ohh

if life goes passing you by
dont cry
if you breaking the rules
making your moves
paying your dues
chasing the coolyeahyeah this one right here
i dedicate this one right here
to everybody out there ya diguh-huh

[verse 1]
now i aint tryin to be the greatest
i used to hate hip hop yup because the women degraded
but too short made me laugh like a hypocrite i played it
a hypocrite i stated though i only recited half
omittin the word bitch cursin i wouldnt say it
me and dog couldnt relate til a bitch i dated
forgive my favorite word for her and hers alike
but i learned it from a song i heard and sorta liked
yea further ice and glamorized drug-dealin was appealin
but the block club kept it from in front our buildin
gangsta rap based filmings became the building blocks for children
with leakin ceilings catchin drippings with pots
coupled with compositions from pac nass it was written 
in the mix with my realities and feelings
living conditions religion ignorant wisdom and artistic vision
i began to jot tap the world and listen
it drop

[refrain]
my mom cant feed me my boyfriend beats me
i have sex for money the hood dont love me
the cops wanna kill me this nonsense built me
and i got no place to go

took me off they welfare cant afford they health care
my teacher wont teach me my master beats me
and it hurts me soul

[verse 2]
i had a ghetto boy bop a jay-z boycott
cause he said that he never prayed to god he prayed to gotti
im thinkin golly god guard me from the ungodly
but by my 30th watching of the streets is watchin
i was back to giving props again and that was botherin
bout as uncomfortable as a untouchable touchin you
the theme songs that niggas hustle to 
seem wrong but these songs was comin true
and it was all becomin cool
i found a condom on the ground that johns would cum into and thought
what constitutes a prostitute is the pursuit of profit then they drop it
the homie in the suit pat her on the butt then rock it
it seems i was seein the same scene adopted
prevalent in different things with the witnesses indifferent to stop it
they said dont knock it mind ya business
his business isnt mine then that nigga pimpin got it

[refrain ]
they took my daughter i aint got no water
i cant get hired they cross on fire
we all got suspended i just got sentenced
so i got no place to go
they threw down my gang sign i aint got no hang time
they talk about my sneakers poisoned our leader
my father aint seen me turn off my tv
cause it hurts me soul

[verse 3]

they thought it was cool to leave you thirsty and stranded katrina
he thought it was cool to carry a gun in his classroom and open fire virginia tech columbine stop the violence
they thought it was cool to tear down the projects and put up million dollar condos gentrification
they think its cool to stand on the block hiding products in their socks making quick dime bag dollars

i love the seas and i love the shore
no love for no beach baby thats law
but she doesnt see therefore i spoil
i trip i fall run up in raw
i love her with all my heart
every vein every vessel every bullet lodged
with every flower that i ever took apart
she said that she would give me greatness
stat-us placement above the others
my face would grace covers of the magazines of the hustlers 
paper the likes of which that i had never seen
her eyes glows green with the logo of our dreams
the purpose of our scene our obscene obsession for the bling
she would be my queen i could be her king together 
she would make me cool and we would both rule forever
and i would never feel pain
and never be without pleasure ever again
and if the rain stops and every things dry
she would cry just so i could drink the tears from her eyes
she teach me how to fly
even cushion my fall if my engines ever stall
and i plummet from the sky
but she would keep me high
and if i ever die she would commission my image on to her bosom
or maybe shed retire as well
a match made in heaven set the fires in hell and ill be

come these are the tales of the cool
guaranteed to go and make you fail from your school
and seek unholy grails like a fool
and hang with the players of the pool
fast talkin all the hustle
no heaven up above you
no hell underneath ye
and no one will receive thee 
so shed no tear when were not here
and keep your faith as we chase the coolmatthew santos
if you are what they say you are - a superstar
then have no fear the cameras here
and the microphones and they wanna know
if you are that they say you are - a superstar
then have no fear the crowd is here
and the lights are on and they want a show

lupe fiasco
a fresh cool young lu
trying to cash his microphone check two one two
want to believe my own hype but its too untrue
the world brought me to my knees what have you brung you
did you improve on the design did you do something new
well youre name aint on the guest list who brung you
you the more famous person you come through
and the sexy lady next to you you come too
and then it hit me standing outside of heaven waitin for god to come and get me
im too uncouth unschoold to the rules and too gum shoe
too much of a newcomer and too uncool
like shadow and lavelle i battle with it well
though i need a holiday like lady who sung blue
go back what ever you did you undo
heavy as heaven the devil on my two tons too

if you are what they say you are - a superstar
then have no fear the cameras here
and the microphones and they wanna know

lupe fiasco
and you better wear your shades
the spotlights here can burn holes through the stage
down through the basement past the indian graves where the dinosaurs laid
and out through china nearly misses air liners
magnified times five this is pointed at the rhymer
ricochets off the moon and sets the forest ablaze
now thats important to say cause even with all of that most of us dont want it to fade
we want it to braid meaning we want it to grow meaning we want it to stay
like the governor called and he told him to wait
un-strap him from the chair and put him back in his cage
the audience aint fazed and they aint gone clap and they aint gone praise 
they want everything back that they paid cause they been waiting since ten to see the lights get dim

if you are that they say you are - a superstar
then have no fear the crowd is here
and the lights are on and they want a show

lupe fiasco
so chauffeur chauffeur come and take me away
cause ive been standing in this line for like five whole days
me and security aint getting along
and when i got to the front they told me all of the tickets were gone
so just take me home where the mood is mellow
and the roses are thrown m&amp;ms are yellow 
and the light bulbs around my mirror dont flicker
everybody gets a nice autographed picture
one for you and one for your sister
who had to work tonight but is an avid listener
every songs a favorite song and mics dont feedback
all the reviewers say you need to go and see that
and everybody claps cause everybody is pleased
then they all take the stage and start performing for me
like ha ha ha ha ha

then he put him down and went back to the kitchen
and put on another beat and got back to the mission
to get his momma out the hood put her somewhere in the woods

cause one day a rapist attacked her and broke that all apart
she said there was no way to fix it or to cover her scars
then one day a guy came along and probably could help her start
he was sincere made her believe it was safe for her to trust again
before long she was cool with givin hugs to him
knew that it was right 
cause something was wrong the alarms in her mind didnt tell her

the stars are aligned and the planets colliding
and the plan is arriving and shes out there smiling
the fear is upon us the skies tried to warn us
your parents are goners no children to mourn
its driving me crazy this war is my lady
these bombs are our babies and god is amazing
the tick of the timer the slip of your rival
the pimps and the rise of your pulse where youll find her

disease the virus is spreadin in all directions
no safe zone no cure and no protection
no symptoms to find the signs of an infection
no vaccines remedies and no corrections
quarantine your dreams and sever all connections
dont let em in not a friend not a reflection
everybodys got it and wants you to have it next and
dont accept em if you want to stay as an exception
no pill can heal the ill of this
sickness some are still in doubt of its existence
some call it forgiveness and some call it the vengeance
some say its an exit some say its an entrance
the poor say the rich have the cure
the rich say the poor are the source
revolutionaries say its psychological war 
invented by the press just to have something to report
some say the first case came from a maternity ward
some say a morgue some say the skies some say the floors
whores say the nuns nuns say the whores
and everybody is sure
the scientists say it only infects the mind
the little boy said it only infects the girls
the preacher man said its gonna kill off the soul
a bum said its gonna kill the whole wide world

verse two - lupe fiasco
believe some say the neon signs by the loud speakers repeatin that everything is fine
a subtle silence to demolish the trouble conscience of accomplished with no knowledge and every freedom denied
every dream is designed and broadcasted from the masses to the masses from the antennaes on top of the shrines
was fine and received and planted during the panic and surely it reports back everything in your mind
everything is lyin everything is dyin
everying is a rule everything is a crime
everything was here then everything rewind
new weather burned the feathers off everything flyin
and she likes it and she loves it
the sadness the madness the bad shit the lavish the fastest the clashes
the ashes to ashes everything intertwined
my femme fatale my darlin fallen angel
once caught her changin the batteries in her halo
receipt for wings and everything that she paid for
and the address to the factory where they made those
the scientist said shes already inside my mind
the little boy said what happened to all the girls
the preacher man said shes gonna kill off the soul
the dope boy said its the whole wide world

a macabre parade of the toys he made
and shemaghs and shades who look half his age
about half the size of the flags they wave
and camouflaged suits made to fit youths
cause the ones off the dead soldiers hang a little loose
with ak-47s that they shootin into heaven
like they tryin to kill the jetsons
its struggles little recruits
cute smileless heartless violent
childhood destroyed devoid of all childish ways
cant write they own names or read the words thats on they own graves
think you gangsta popped a few rounds
these kidsll come through and murder a whole town
then sit back and smoke and watch it burn down
the grave gets deeper the further we go down

my snorkle is a tuba lu the ruler around these seas
westside poseido westside beside him
chest high and rising almost touching the knees
of stewardess and the pilot lucky they make ya fly with
personal floating devices tricks falling out of my sleeves

hello darkness
[x6] you

all in together the weather is better than ever
i hope it never ends i hope it lasts forever
but when it does we can all pretend that its better than its ever been
lie to ourselves like the sky to rebel
and its well and its fine and its fine if it fell
and you couldnt find the story line if you survive to retell
we are targets hello darkness
hello sunshine hello not at all hello all the time
hello nowhere hello oblivion hello goodbye

said everything is going to be fine
said everything is gonna be ok
said just dont breathe the air

he just sits and waits for them to kick in the door
he once was a hero they dont love him no more
theres a blast every time a foot hits the floor
his gift for not fighting another mans war
and if they can get their hands on the mask that he wore
on his face they can put somebody else in his place and restore
the state the illusion that its safe
the fate that being a slave is so great
as gas fills the room and rockets destroy everything around him
he stands to find himself surrounded
by thousands of soldiers that he once trained to never miss their targets
heartless hello darkness
hello sunshine hello not at all hello all the time
hello nowhere hello oblivion hello goodbye

hello darkness

pleased to make your acquaintance
salutations konnichiwa
hello end of the world how are you i do fine

hello darkness hello sunshine hello not at all hello all the time

and their love for it is the reason i have become this praised
lemme put you on game

i make them heartless
and in return the have become my martyrs
ive been in the poem of many a poet
and i reside in the art of many a artist
lemme put you on game
some of your smartest have tried to articulate
my whole part in this
but theyre fruitless in their harvest
the drow grows from my footsteps
im the one that they follow
i am the one that they march with
lemme put you on game
through the back alleys
and the black markets
the oval offices
the crackhouses and apartments
through the mazes of the queens
the pages of the sages
and the chambers of the kings
lemme put you on game
through the veins-es of the fiends
a paper chasers pager
yo im famous on the scene
one of the oldest most ancient-est of things
speak every single language on the planet knamean
lemme put you on game
i am the american dream
the rape of africa
the undying machine
the overpriced medicine
the murderous regime
the tough guys front
and the one behind the scenes
lemme put you on game
i am the blood of this city
its gas water and electricity
im its gym and its math and its history
the gunshots in the class
and you cant pass if youre missin g
i taught them better than that
i taught them aim for the head
and hope they never come back
im glad your daddys gone baby
hope he never comes back
i hope hes with your mother
with my hustlers high in my traps
lemme put you on game
i hope you die in his trash
i cant help it all i hear when youre crying is laughs
im sure somebody find you tied up in this bag
behind the hospital little baby
crack addicts had
lemme put you on game
then maybe you can grow up to be a stripper
a welfare-receiving prostitute
and gold digger
you can watch on tv
how they should properly depict you
the rivers should flow with liquor
quench your thirst on my elixirs
lemme put you on game
i am the safe haven for the rebel runaway and the resistor
the trusted misleader
the number one defender
and from a throne of their bones i rule
these fools are my fuel
so i make them cool
lemme put you on game
baptize them in the water out of scarface pool
and feed em from the table that held the corleones food
if you die tell em that you played my game
i hope your bullet holes become mouths that say my name
cause im the gunshotmatthew santos

well you cant see me thats cause everything is black
black x13 everything is black
black x12 you cant see methings are getting out of control
feels like im running out of soul
youre getting heavy to hold
think ill be letting you go

my self-portrait
shows a man that the wealth tortured
self absorbed with his own self
forfeit a shelf full of awards
worshiping the war ships that set sail on my sea of life
way i see my own self and wonder if we still see alike
we was tight seeing lights
speaking right and breathing life
now i see my demons and barely even sleep at night
i dont get high life keep me at a decent height
as the old me i predicted all my recent plights
exhausted trying to fall asleep
lost inside my recent fights
burdens on my shoulders now
burning all my motors down
inspiration drying up
motivation slowing down

things are getting out of control
feels im running out of soul
youre getting heavy to hold
think ill be letting you go

im begging you dont let me go
we vowed like the letter o
to never go our separate ways
to spin off into separate shows
tired of all the wardrobe changing
playing all these extra roles
filled with all these different spirits
living off these separate souls
point of life is getting hollow
cant wait for the exit hole
give me room to entry wound
let me in or let me go
so i can roam around this wilderness
see it for what it really is unprepared and filter-less
magnify the euphony
alibi the shooting spree
amplify the revolution
sanitize the lunacy
strip away the justice
justify the scrutiny
i can see the lasers shooting out of you and me 

things are getting out of control
feels like im running out of soul
youre getting heavy to hold
think ill be letting you go

sometimes i feel like the world
sometimes i feel lonely and the world is against me
and everything that ive done before i swear we used to be so pure
but we cant be in love no more cause i dont want to fight this war
but when i put down my gun i turn around and pick up one
its an uzi waste of time but i think im done

things are getting out of control
feels like im running out of soul
youre getting heavy to hold
think ill be letting you goits so loud inside my head
with words that i should have said
as i drown in my regrets
i cant take back the words i never said
i cant take back the words i never said

i really think the war on terror is a bunch of bullsh*t
just a poor excuse for you to use up all your bullets
how much money does it take to really make a full clip
9/11 building 7 did they really pull it

and a bunch of other cover ups
your childs future was the first to go with budget cuts
if you think that hurts then wait here comes the uppercut
the school was garbage in the first place thats on the up and up

keep you at the bottom but tease you with the upper crust
you get it then they move it so you never keeping up enough
if you turn on tv all you sees a bunch of what the f*cks
dude is dating so and so blabbering about such and such

and that aint jersey shore homie thats the news
and these the same people supposedly telling us the truth
limbaugh was a racist glen beck is a racist ghaza strip
was getting bombed but obama didnt say sh*t

thats why i didnt vote for him next one either
im a part of the problem my problem is im peaceful
and i believe in the people
yeah

its so loud inside my head
with words that i should have said
as i drown in my regrets
i cant take back the words i never said

now we can say it aint our fault if we never heard it
but if we know better then we probably deserve it
jihad is not holy war wheres that in the worship
murdering is not islam and you are not observant

and you are not a muslim
israel dont take my side cause look how far youve pushed em
walk with me into the ghetto this is where all the kush went
complain about the liquor store well what you drinking liquor for

complain about the gloom but whend you pick a broom up
just listenin to pac aint gonna make it stop
a rebel in your thoughts aint gonna make it whole
if you dont become an actor youll never be a factor

pills with a million side effects take em when the pains felt
wash em down with diet soda killing off your brain cells
crooked banks around the world will gladly give a loan today
so if you ever miss a payment they can take your home away

its so loud inside my head
with words that i should have said
as i drown in my regrets
i cant take back the words i never said never said
i cant take back the words i never said

i think that all the silence is worse than all violence
fear is such a weak emotion thats why i despise it
were scared of almost everything afraid to even tell the truth
so scared of what you think of me im scared of even telling you

sometimes im like the only person i feel safe to tell it to
im locked inside a cell in me i know that theres a jail in you
consider this your bailing out so take a breath inhale a few
my screams is finally getting free my thoughts is finally yelling through

its so loud inside my head
with words that i should have said
as i drown in my regrets
i cant take back the words i never saidalbum on hold whole world on hold
crowd is like ho operators like hold please hold
man now aint that cold im just tryin to talk to my homie
thats up in the hole and homegirl not tryin to be a ho
even though she on the pole can she get a second chance no
woah like the opposite of go that aint how its supposed to be
a butterfly but for the sake of rhymin lets just say butterflyee
the truth stings like muhammad ali 
i tell em tell em dont homicide me
im just a little old hope with his back against the ropes
fightin for his fans and fightin for his folks
but the boos from the crowd can become so loud
if i can block em out then i can knock em out and
dance around the ring but until then ill sing

ima keep it cool and ima do me
it is what it is and this how its gon be
until i get there till i get there
and yeah i got flaws i know im not perfect
but all the ups and downs will soon be worth it
when i get there when i get there

doctor doctor please the fame aint painless enough
thats cause you aint famous enough
you got a little game but your name aint ringin enough
he said take two of these put some change in my cup
i said i wasnt poor he gave me some more
prescribed me a publicist and pointed to the door
out ouch im tellin you this all from a therapists couch
tell me bout your mother what shes all about
prescribed me an interview and then told me to bounce
damn geeze the world is so cold im glad i bought these skis
went right off of the bunny slopes and right into the trees
rendered unconscious they rushed me to a concert
instead of green jello and made me chicken soup
they fed me magazine covers and video shoots

ima keep it cool and ima do me
it is what it is and this how its gon be
until i get there till i get there
and yeah i got flaws i know im not perfect
but all the ups and downs will soon be worth it
when i get there when i get there

and when i finally make it ima stunt so hard
evil as knievel ima jump so far
way up in the atmosphere i aint coming back
be a jerk to them jerks yeah thatll make em hurt
huh said a young boy in the mirror
a young version of me so i started to tear up
he said you need to cheer up your mind need to clear up
youre already here just be yourself from here up
then he disappeared and i felt something familiar
something i was taught something i had lost
if you are afraid or fear that you gon change some
all you gotta do is just remember where you came from

ima keep it cool and ima do me
it is what it is and this how its gon be
until i get there till i get there
and yeah i got flaws i know im not perfect
but all the ups and downs will soon be worth it
when i get there when i get thereim not a choo-choo im a turbo
hater pray to god that i turn slow 
like im sipping on purple 
but i aint on your glow

dont admit that your faith is weak
dont say that you feel like dying
lifes hard and it feels like diamonds
your homes just far too gone

and who are we we must be
a #1 song spinning all day long

over again and over again
and over again and over again
and over again and we dont win
when we call in and nothings free
sounds to me like
state-run radio state-run radio
state-run radio state-run radio
state-run radio state-run radio
state-run radio state-run radio

we interrupt this broadcast
to bring you this special message about the forecast
the futures cloudy and its raining on the poor class
road to peace is closed heavy traffic on the war paths
love is boiling on the budget
the military says its gonna need more cash
to keep fighting for your gas
keep us in our hoods and hope we never explore past
stay inside of your half
believe the lies you learned in your class
that theres no treasure in your trash
and a sealy has the same feeling that the floor has
and thats where you should stay this is what they play

over again and over again
and over again and over again
and over again and we dont win
when we call in and nothings free
sounds to me like
state-run radio state-run radio
state-run radio state-run radio
state-run radio state-run radio
state-run radio state-run radio

youre now tuned into the weakest
frequency of fear keep you locked right here
and hope you never leave this
never be a leader
think inside the box and follow all procedures
never ever believe that you will never need this
hit up all your friends and tell them to repeat this
higher on the air not what you want to hear
but we aint got the truth but how about a remix
different is never good good is only what we pick
you aint got a hit unless it sounds like these did
not too smart youll be a superstar
and if youre dumb or something
maybe you could be #1

over again and over again
and over again and over again
and over again and we dont win
when we call in and nothings free
sounds to me like
state-run radio state-run radio
state-run radio state-run radio
state-run radio state-run radio
state-run radio state-run radio

so beware whats on the airwaves
and be more aware of whats not getting airplay
independent spirits you can barely hear what theyre saying
truth aint getting on like shampoo on an airplane
propagandas everwhere constantly on replay
all the hits all the time back to back on relay
but really where it lives
make them hear the records we play
build your own station become your own dj

you must be a radio station
and who are we we must be
a #1 song spinning all day long
and you put me in daily rotation
youre on the air we know youre scared
but we dont care
well play this here

over again and over again
and over again and over again
and over again and we dont win
when we call in and nothings free
sounds to me like

pictures i painted on the walls where we hang
from the trees we hung
strange fruit man look at how we swung
how the hell you gonna tell us something
we aint have a father
how to try to grow up and be one
see umm feel it in my bones
that im sittin on a throne
like a killer with a chrome
when i spit another poem
shed a whole lot of light on a little bit of home

[lupe fiasco-verse 1]
uh and we aint get exploited
white man aint feared so he did not destroy it
we aint work for free see they had to employ it
built it up together so we equally appointed
first 400 years see we actually enjoyed it
constitution written by the web du bois
were no reconstructions civil war got avoided
little black sambo grows up to be a lawyer
extra extra on the news stands

where fox news reports live
that ahmadinejad wins mandela peace prize

[lupe fiasco-verse 2]
uh and it aint no projects
keepin it real is not an understood concept
yea complexions not a contest
cuz racism has no context
hip-hop aint got a section called conscious
everybody rappin like crack never happened
crips never occurred nor bloods to attack them
matter a fact no hood to attack in
somalia is a great place to relax in
fred astaire was the first to do a backspin
the rat pack was cool group of black men
that inspired the five white guys called the jacksons
eminem fitted in but then again he inspired a black rapper tryin to mimic him
and thats a really rose up out of michigan the sign of white rapper by the name of 50 cent

[hook]

[lupe fiasco-verse 3]
uh and i know its just a fantasy
i cordially invite you to ask why cant it be
now we can do nothing bout the past
but we can do something about the future that we have
we can make fast or we can make it last

best foot forward for every step

lets remember if ever we get
down the places that we came from round
and all the good times on the bad side of town
the up side of bad flip it upside down
came from the bottom but we up high now
believe and from this view we achieved
we look back at the rules we received
and how we broke those dismantled and rewrote those
and the ghost still alive in the photos
sounds of the summer didnt go wise
cold wind blowin through a city on fire
moments of the past came here to find you
not to relive them just to remind you

we walk into the glow right into the light
the past all around us the time of our life
the first love kisses the broke heart disses
this is just like a first class ticket
back to the first written rap
crumbled up paper and a pen with no cap
the hand-me-down clothes and the unturned hat
the hookers on the corner and the kids selling crack
the needles in the yard where we used to play catch
stories from the projects we could never go at
or to these are shades of my youth
trials of a child everything truth
moments of the past coming back to find us
not to relive them just to remind us

john legend

murals that salute freedom or death for liberty
be it inglewood or egypt bedstuy or baghdad
syria or liberia the west bank or the west side of chicago
where food and liquor stores still occupy the block
while police and community watchmen justify why they shot
emmit till and malice green rekia boyd and trayvon martin
better not wear that hoodie while shopping for a carton
or whatever they sellin in your food desert
cause your soul is dessert and will be dissected and consumed
on the fox evening news while we sing the blues
the new jim crow caged bird sings
cause hes tired of occupying his misery and of our marching

they gave him medicine diagnosed him with a felony and mental retardation
so he refuses to cease the firin nobodys hirin
in illinois 67 is the new age when you retirin
class lines have blurred those who used to have have not
pensions bein snatched
those who never have keep their hands stretched
social services being cut
sterilization clinics giving out pills to numb the womb
young girls referring to their vaginas as tombs
thinkin protests are temporary and trendy
well rock a t-shirt and carry a poster
and two weeks later its back to normal
but they say times are changin
the revolution is becoming second nature causes are combining
people carrying torches hope burning from their hands
attaching explosive devices cause they keep stealing their lands
in the name of freedom

cause i cant find no reconciliation with your past
when there was nothing equal for my people in your math
you forced us in the ghetto and then you took our dads
the belly of the beast these streets are demons abs
im telling you that setup in them sit-ups is so sad
the system is a slab
corruption is the swinger sittin high ridin dirty drag racin into danger
and its so clean pine trees smellin good
with work off in the trunk and niggas in the hood
so i cant shed blood on any battlefield of yours
i pray the ugly truth comes and shatters your decor
and as it all falls down and tatters on the floor
i shed tears i dont know what really matters anymore
cause i dont know what really matters anymore

many things strangest things you ever seen
oh look at how they swing would you look at how they swing
embedded they go no eyelids gone low
or gone by sundown theyre dodging 5-0

now as i wander through the city goin mad
i see the fruits of planting evidence instead of grass
a swindled generation with no patience full of swag
man they so impatient with the stations that they have
as long as they look good when they be doin bad
then the separation from the truth is gettin vast fast
be a slave at first or free at last
double-edged choices make a nigga wanna pass
double-headed voices from the eagle on the staff
the pyramid where eyes will split the spirited in half
divided over money
delighted by the dummyin down of the importance of crowns well never have
thats why my sounds and sermons are so full of wrath
baptize your mind let your brain take a bath
swim inside the river get delivered from the craft
of the witches in this business that be livin off your sad
hatin on your happiness you hit em off with laughs
smile til they surrender then you kill em off with glad
hello evil im back

pills make you stupid and liquor do the same thing
raris too expensive and they way too hard to maintain
get yourself a camry nigga said a camry
watch that ho depreciate and then youll understand me
its called being fiscally responsible
dont let these lying images up in hip-hop here conquer you
the tvs not your father fool that videos not your momma
try your best to be a man and your worst to be a monster

may we have some roses for the ladies
a little appreciation for the gentlemen
and heres some kisses for the babies

more peace to the teachers of blind kids
to rebels in small cells keeping their mind big
say everything’s hostile
suicide bombers and prosperity gospels emaciated models
with cocaine and blood pouring out their nostrils they got to
just to stay awake on the catwalk of life where everybody watch you
straight hair high heels and a handbag
crucifixes racism and a land grab
katrina fema trailers human body sandbags
a peace sign and a pants sag
a money toss cause a 9 stripper mad dash
a friend request following a hash tag
now everybody want it like the last laugh
a michael jackson jacket or a daft mask
purple jordans or the mixed girl in your math class
stable is when the ba’ath had baghdad
but corporate jets really had to have that gas bad
war and they hope they all fall from the ratatat

america’s a big motherfuckin’ garbageman
if you ain’t know you’re part and parcel of the problem
you say no you ain’t and i say yes you is
soon as you find out what planned obsolescence is
you say no they didn’t and i say yes they did
the definition of unnecessary-ness
manifested
say that we should protest just to get arrested
that goes against all my hustling ethics
a bunch of jail niggas say its highly ineffective
depart from martin connect on malcolm x tip
insert baldwin to similar the separate
to me the truth is more fulfilling than a meth hit
or finding really fast internet to have some sex with
it’s all one song short of a set list
couple croissants shy of a continental breakfast
or blowing out your birthday candles just to make a death wish
so absurd word to chief bone necklace
down at the lakota sioux casino
a whole culture boiled down to giving you paquino
i go as left as a heart in the chest
cause the horn of africa is now starving to death

the projects of oakland city detroit ghost towns
monopolies on poverty where d-boy coke bound
it’s parts of manilla like the video for thriller
but the us embassy is reminiscent of a villa
if poverty is chocolate and privilege vanilla
then what’s the flavor of the sunday preacher’s pedophilia
cash rules everything around these niggas

bring em out the black like a lighthouse
and wave to em before they wiped out
lifesaver threw em hope they catch it
but its so titanic to be iced out
thats just scratching the surface like triple axels
want to roll around that bentley like crystal castles
in addition to the chain
thats just to take the attention from the pain
or is it the mission of the man

i say bitch bad woman good lady better
hey hey hey hey

now imagine theres a shorty maybe five maybe four
ridin round with his mama listening to the radio
and a song comes on and a not far off from being born
doesnt know the difference between right and wrong
now i aint trying to make it too complex
but lets just say shorty has an undeveloped context
about the perception of women these days
his mama sings along and this what she says
niggas im a bad bitch and im bad bitch
far above average
and maybe other rhyming words like cabbage and savage
and baby carriage and other things that match it
couple of things that are happenin here
first hes relatin the word bitch with his mama comma
and because shes relatin to herself
his most important source of help and mental health
he may skew respect for dishonor

bitch bad woman good
lady better they misunderstood
im killin these bitches
uh tell em
bitch bad woman good
lady better they misunderstood
they misunderstood
im killin these bitches

yeah now imagine a group of little girls nine through twelve
on the internet watchin videos listenin to songs by themselves
it doesnt really matter if they have parental clearance
they understand the internet better than their parents
now being the internet the contents probably uncensored
theyre young so theyre maleable and probably unmentored
a complicated combination maybe with no relevance
until that intelligence meets their favorite singers preference
bad bitches bad bitches bad bitches
thats all i want and all i like in life is bad bitches bad bitches
now lets say that theyre less concerned with him
and more with the video girl acquiescent to his whims
ah the plot thickens
high heels long hair fat booty slim
reality check im not trippin
they dont see a paid actress just what makes a bad bitch

bitch bad woman good
lady better they misunderstood
i say i say i say i say i say i say
im killin these bitches
bitch bad woman good
lady better they misunderstood
im killin these bitches

disclaimer this rhymer lupes not usin bitch as a lesson
but as a psychological weapon
to set in your mind and really mess with your conceptions
discretions reflections its clever misdirection
cause while i was rappin they was growin up fast
nobody stepped in to ever slow em up gasp
sure enough in this little world
the little boy meets one of those little girls
and he thinks she a bad bitch and she thinks she a bad bitch
he thinks disrespectfully she thinks of that sexually
she got the wrong idea he dont wanna fuck her
he thinks shes bad at being a bitch like his mother
momma never dress like that come out the house hot mess like that
ass titties dress like that
all out to impress like that
just like that you see the fruit of the confusion
he caught in a reality she caught in an illusion
bad mean good to her she really nice and smart
but bad mean bad to him bitch dont play your part
but bitch still bad to her if you say it the wrong way
but she think she a bitch what a double entendre

bitch bad woman good
lady better they misunderstood
i say i say i say i say i say i say
im killin these bitches
bitch bad woman good
lady better they misunderstood
im killin these bitches

bitch bad woman good
lady better they misunderstood
youre misunderstood
im killin these bitches
bitch bad woman good
lady better greatest motherhood
eh he heh
im killin these bitchesits a mad world out here i tell you
the worlds gone stark raving mad
everyone in the world is mad
its a mad crazy world

i see diamond-flooded demons
lamborghini angels
lamborghini angels
lamborghini angels
halos down with the doors flapping when they came through
halos down with the doors flapping when they came through

with a circle on the floor he compels them to be pure
pulls the beast out of his heart then impales it on a sword
writes a prayer on some paper and then he nails it to the door
just the good of you may enter by the mercy of the lord
listen not to what he speaks thats been the cursing of his cause
a seduction of his senses by the devils he adores
the unholy has him hostage and his soul is now at war
follow not his secret knowledge it will bring you no reward
shun him while in public disallow him from your stores
have no part in his affairs less his pestilence be yours
make scoundrels of the righteous and virgins into whores
but we must still pray that his colour will be cured

i see diamond-flooded demons
lamborghini angels
lamborghini angels
lamborghini angels
halos down with the doors flapping when they came through
halos down with the doors flapping when they came through

with her eyes to the ceiling and a needle in her brain
he looks back into the crowd wipes the blood and then explains
how she slipped from this existence to the realm of the deranged
her becoming must be halted to reverse what she became
from the looseness of her tongue to the pollution of her aims
to do nothing is barbaric the solution is humane
you must destroy the mind and hopefully retrain
you torture out the wildness then replace it with the tame
blank slate when she recovers she wont even know her name
perfect wife and perfect lover no resistance no complaints
may god bless the scientific cure for the insane
knew she couldnt go to school but she thought that that should change

i see diamond-flooded demons
lamborghini angels
lamborghini angels
lamborghini angels
halos down with the doors flapping when they came through
halos down with the doors flapping when they came through

with his crucifix inside his pocket said his mission is divine
put his bible on the bed and then he touched on his behind
told him take off all his clothes and put your penis next to mine
now the little boy think its normal because they do this all the time
with no life inside his body now he finally think he’s safe
but they cut off all his fingers while they piss all in his face
he take pictures with his killers then they sneak back to the states
now he sit next to the picture of his wife when she was raped
with the teleprompter rolling he looks right into the lens
doesn’t mention his redemption but absolves him of his sins
he forgives them in advance says that he will do again

my fellow americans

i see diamond-flooded demons
lamborghini angels
lamborghini angels
lamborghini angels

revered by the rich plus approved by the poor
i guess its better when they sniff it
and screwed up where they pour

and i scubad way down low
put the top down on my fears
put the roof up on my woes
i dropped that food and liquor to put you up on my stove
they shoplifted and stole
that just let me know they know
that was lupe #1 now this version #4
and i still feel like a virgin me versus the globe
from the surface to the cove
i took on the biggest wave
and i surfed it to the shore with no pomade in my fro

may the lord have
mercy on my soulima just go and then well figure it out from there
they say form follows function
and if you just function properly then things will form themselves
yeah thats kind of what it is
so on that note americas most

first off gotta send shout outs to my niggas
then shout outs to my inner demon that be creepin around my temple
ready to set me off like vivica or make me cross like a crucifix
or the legs on a buddhist sitter deep in thought
thinking as deep as the sea of salt
and they sink in the same sea that we walk
not that we jesus we just dont wait until it thaws
but you can hold my hand like applause pause/paws
with no homophobia involved
now if i wouldve said that you can hold my balls like vfw halls
that wouldve been the call but naw
you cant see in ours but we can see in yours
you cant see in ours cause ours is kingdom hall

yeah just like that we just let it roll you know
yeah and check it check it

so when that pond thaws and its no longer gretzky
thats when we jetski
i gotta catch up to myself i kind of left me
are the windows still blocked up lets see
maybe see something we couldnt view before
been in the stu all day cooking food for thought
now out the soup du jour for you and yours
might find sushi for your soul we call that moving raw
lions wont cross the line
cougars wont move a paw
chickens wont cross the road
dogs wont roof at all
always had flow just added a front door roof and walls
hotter than the fire that into which koopa falls
but thats only if you super dawg
sicker than when you use your dog to do assaults
you can never really tell just whos the fraud
truth might still be alive like true and false
thats why i never really trust unless its lu endorsed
sponsored by me and of course you know who enforced
now thats three mes like you warming up your vocal chords
add a fourth if your vocals hoarse
like mister ed
get out of pocket have a horses head in your bed
now thats what i call a good nights rest

you know you know just plays like that
when you just let it flow
when you sit back and just let it go you know

and now my vocals warm
add a fifth and a sixth now im ready to perform
the buddhist said that i am not reformed
if i ever be reborn i keep coming back as me
we dont forget the other five as we
weave the most wanted angelina jolies
and morgan frees
send it around the room like we smoking trees
but its no purple in the circle then there aint no rolling
bees just spoken words thought provoking reeds
hydro im still strolling on the seas
aloe like the lotion from the leaves
and to achieve it took a lot of token like chuck e cheese
all without touching weed
but im still hungry and im having lunch for three
this is my form now what the function be

and aww at what i draw
and ooh at what i say like imogen heap
good night niggas go to sleep
you know its like form follows function
and if you function properly then
the form will come out of it
and whatever it is it
it just be what it is you knowat my brothers janazah
tears stained sunglassses
a salat with no bows
pallbearer carry you to the car now
chilly day mosque on 96 and 3rd
new york city way me and jay never left my side
rest like that picture with your pride
who look just like
now the city looks less bright
brooklyn looking less special
dont carry the same weight
as when you were on this level
you work in progress from 40 projects god bless
an inspiration and a king
they wont know what i mean but this one bout to spring
protect it with every feather on the wings
so even when it hurts youll never feel a thing

said its a cold cold war
aint nobody wins like the government
in the ussr
cause this is all for shares
nobody cares
who you think you are
and you can fight it but theres no defense
for what things are
baby grab a jacket
its a cold cold

let me clarify the chorus
and what my cold war is
cause the complexity is enormous
using one of my greatest losses with eyes like faucets
to reinforce every single word that i talk with
something about losing things human beings
that reduces things to their most elementary
find yourself where you never meant to be
with the energy of memories
thats the soul force of whats behind killing me
finding pleasure in the pains
like finding desert in the rain
twisted how this world can drive you masochistic
question if im over it
or if im numb because im closureless
or my closures that we all gotta go and shit
rendered emotionless but moving at the speed of running over it
still happy that i opened it

said its a cold cold war
aint nobody wins like the government
in the ussr
cause this is all for shares
nobody cares
who you think you are
and you can fight it but theres no defense
for what things are
baby grab a jacket
its a cold cold

in the studio writing these words one after another
in memorial of my brother
as you listen to the album with
nothing on the cover
i imagine that he hovers
in the back of his chair
floating right there in the air
nodding his head to the music i slightly lose it
ask why do i put myself through this
crack a smile look up at the file
the waveforms on the screen of me tryna tell you what i mean
but i feel that its all lost or maybe that its all gotta cross
happy with his dedicated song
but now hes all gone
but he was never there cause
he was everywhere nowhere and down here
maybe on that judgement day rise up
well both open our eyes up climb up
hoping god forgives us for our tendencies
wipes away our cool young histories

said its a cold cold war
aint nobody wins like the government
in the ussr
cause this is all for shares
nobody cares
who you think you are
and you can fight it but theres no defense
for what things are
baby grab a jacket
its a cold cold

ride around you know what im saying
all over the world right i mean everywhere
i mean we just disappear and just come back
i feel like we can just put him anywhere
hed find his way back home yknowm saying
another random things that consequence to me
but maybe to you not much
but with that said the reason behind me
why i do what i does love
just riding around bumping that uh
either jay or nas or me
i used to tell him like yeah you alright
but you aint fucking with my man
it was always like that so
drop a little for you let it bump
this that esco music its that esco music
bumping with my esco music that raw
see you on the other side as-salamu alaykumthis world my heart my soul
things that i dont know
the icicles they grow
they never let me go
scars are left as proof
but tears they soak on through
things ive done
my young
my unforgivable youth

we land on the horizon the passion in their eyes then
what they think of islands and much more in their size
bountiful and plentiful and resource to provide them
supplies slim morale when so heavily inside them
now steadily declining 
return is not an option as necessity denies them 
with this they choose to dive in
now along the shore and so aware of their arriving
other children of this land prepare to share in their surviving
a pigeontry of feathers stands his majesty with treasure
now the material things that kings that could never last forever
but secrets of the spirit world and how to live in harmony together
unbenounced to him his head would be the first that they would sever
and stuck up on a pike up along the beach 
kept up as a warning to the rest to turn away from their beliefs
and so began it here and for 500 years 
torture terror fear til they nearly disappear

this world my heart my soul
things that i dont know
the icicles they grow
they never let me go
scars are left as proof
but tears they soak on through
things ive done
my young
my unforgivable youth

ways and means from mistreated human beings 
a slave labor force provides wealth to the machine 
and helps the new regime establish and expand 
using manifest destiny to siphon off the land 
from native caretakers who can barely understand 
how can land be owned by another man warns one can not steal what was given as a gift is the sky owned by birds and the rivers owned by fish 
but the lesson when the heated for the sake of whats not needed 
you kill but do not eat it 
the excessive and elitists dont repair it when they leave it 
the forestss were cleared the factories were built 
and your mistakes will be repeated by your future generation doomed to pay for your mistreatments 
foolishness and flaws greed and needs and disagreement 
and you rushed to have the most from the day you left your boats 
youll starve but never die in a world of hungry ghosts

this world my heart my soul
things that i dont know
the icicles they grow
they never let me go
scars are left as proof
but tears they soak on through
things ive done
my young
my unforgivable youth

as archaeologists dig in the deserts of the east
appeared 100 meters wide and 100 meters deep
they discover ancient cars on even older streets
and a city well preserved and most likely at its peak
a culture so advanced and by condition of the teeth
they can tell that they was civil not barbaric in the least
a society at peace with liberty and justice for all
neatly carved in what seems to be a wall
they would doubt that there was any starvation at all
that they pretty much had the poverty problem all solved
from the sheer amount of paper most likely used for trade
everythings so organized they had to be well behaved
assumed they had clean energy but took to no enemies
very honest leaders with overwhelming sympathies
religions kinda complex kinda hard to figure out
and this must be the temple
this white house

this world my heart my soul
things that i dont know
the icicles they grow
they never let me go
scars are left as proof
but tears they soak on through
things ive done

yeah
uh

were all chemicals vitamins and minerals
vicodin with inner tubes wrapped around the arm
to see the vein like a chicken on the barn
top cat chat lets begin another yarn
thats flying saucer cheese or is it chicken parm
but roosters dont fly like boosters dont buy
so what powers cowards to get them to the top
just to fall asleep listening to bach
the ribbon in the sky is the riddim that i drop
dribbling the eye across the prism of a clock
that lacks meaning but racks up stacks of fat reading
they catch chief and wrapped up plants from trap dealings
now whats a coffin with a scratched ceiling
and whats the talking without the match feeling
thats buried living and cherry picking
every lemon from your berry system
then proceed with the pack feeding
when i was young i had visions of another world
sneaking looks at the porn stash of my brother hurl
incense smoke made vortices and other curls
casting calls from porn films and ad space for rubber girls
i like my pancakes cut in swirls
moroccan moles and undercover squirrels
i like cartoons southern cities with large moons
faith healers ex-female drug dealers and art booms
apologize for my weird mix
what taste like hot dogs and tear drips
and looks like pantomime and clear bricks
and smells like shotguns and deer piss
they on their hunt kind of salty that im going hard
first part of a party that i throw in parts
one minute youre playing pool next minute youre throwing darts
but thats how you do with a party that you throw in bars
i run the gambit like im throwing cards
from popular mechanics to overdosing hearts
paint cold pictures like nova scotia landscapes
nerd game make mandelbrot sets when we handshake
a word game back up plan that can dam lakes
backup the wordplay playing at the mans states
means i can still be the man if the dam breaks
and when demand brakes im reflectious what they cant face
my peers will still treat the mirror like its a fan base
the unfettered veteran the eagle feathered man of medicine
that hovers above cities like weather men
and maybe weather woman
whatever better to tell ya weather comin
i prefer girls to reign all over the world
and not rain like rain man or rain like rain dance
or rain like a slight chance of rain when its raining
or rein like deer slaves to santa claus sleigh man
but reign like queens that reign over made man
and not queen like queen killer rhapsody bohemian queen
but queen like white glove wave hand
and not wave hand like its a heat wave
so you make a fan by waving your hand
im talking wave like you saying hey
man and not hay for horses and hoarse like you almost voiceless
you gotta treat your vocal chords like its a fortress
and treat every single one of your words like reinforcements
and especially when youre recording
cause thats the portion thats important
when i was reporting that i was poor
but now im more than
its still hooker heels on my sugar hills and sweet spots
crying shames make margarita rims from cheap tops
deep plots in floor to ceiling windows for my peep pots
a little scene with the sickle swings to make the wheat drop
and a hundred words for them hummingbirds that like to eavesdrop
and fan out like peacocks with a parakeet that beat box
so the sun rise when the beat drops
and the sun dies when the beat stops
then it unties then it relocks
then it relapsed then it detox
then heat back like a heat pack
on his knee caps of the weak spot
cause he want what we got like yeah

yeah uh

then forge poetry like a young honorary morrissey
then spit it to the golden locks thots who like their porridge all watery
not scorching nor sorbety
from the steel orbitings sorcerer sorcery
coming down gorgeously
just like a stacey dash waterfall
a more torturing a water boarding barbie doll
a river of women like a brazilian carnival
swimming in feminine bikinis made out of barbasol
somebody give them the volleyballs
if you love her dont ever send her to mally malls
homie if she lonely she might end up in macaulys claws
coming out the closet over goblets down at madri gras
the fame champagne walk of shame lobby call
my rap position was black condition and activism
ammunition for abolition missions attacking systems
but theyre not apt to listen unless its dropping on activision
are we apps or are we bodies filled with apparitions
operating applications stuck inside a apple prison
chicken hack and download updates that lack religion
or are we more
than soil tainting disloyal changelings
preoccupied with boy and goyle chasing
and foiling others royal saintings
i sit back and watch the world through the eye holes in my oil paintings
uh aint nothin to it but to do it
unless you virgin mary nothin do it but the truest
believe all that unless you jewish
life is not a dictionary its a thesaurus
and i feel like a missionary to a clitoris
the water bearer heir of traditions that i swear to never change
my chair position or conditions of my porridge
submission for sedition against the religion of a chorus
keep them golden weave thieves out the mothafuckin forest
as i perform a nerve storm
i prefer my pictures in word form
bury the hatchet like how a bird born
as i paint cold pictures like kool-aid facing condensation
having conversations with flavorful combinations
slave to my concentration
so thats oj da juiceman meets oj with two hands
and two gloves thats too snug
to judge who was who drew blood
and lupe look at all these toucans
in a cemetery full of tomahawks
giving middle fingers to the pigeons doing somersaults
road runners dont fall off cliffs they run across
anomalies by the colony flukes by the reservoir
wildin pursuers end up as poofs on the desert floor
levitating youths who know the truth of where the fountain hides
buccaro roof painting tunnels onto the mountain sides
a thousand parts a pound of heart an ounce of eyes
announcing now the doubt in mouth pronounces a count of lies
chocula counts by the count of five
refrigerator roof full of animals and monsters
incinerator chutes and the manual for contra
assorted memories from my childhood
absorbing energy from the wild woods
electronic combat konami sign contract
chinese chalk killing cucarachas on contact
chicago spray gun aficionado
efficient spitting bridging divisions isnt chicano
who’s the boss if isnt alyssa milano
dudikoff ninja mission into the congo
polarize envy of the older guys
black obi shinobi hittin kenno in the face with all my throwin knives
sub-zero guiding hiding riding in the pack as well
sound village leaf village wolf spirit magic spells
dodging rain and catching hail
faces need samurais to catch the l
special research vessels made for catching whales
filet-o-fish ships sea-shepherded peppered with extra sails
rewrite history liberty needs a better bell
maybe harder irons and carbon fibers that never fail
smarter science mixed with a odd alliance of fairy tale
or maybe just a metal pail you hit with steel tools
to announce that youve had enough and dropping out of seal school
just like trout jumping out their house to let their gills cool
cuba-scuba couldnt take the temperature of my skill pool
i said it feels cool to kill fools
slipping through the cracks like when you try to grill gruel
techno viking water bottle and not following pill rules
will have you off of the throttle when you should be modelin chill mood
roller skater maker or are you just cobblin wheel shoes
overweight taster of kings food that kills crews
oblivious feather-weight baker who autographed cakes whenever his quill moves over your milieu
simple as a buddhist monk in a temple standing in some heel groove with the abbot practising stillness
real still till he realizes his realness
defeat samsara achieves nirvana and brillianceguy sebastian

any love less than unconditional is so under-christian its unrepentant
the physical part of my church emits the invisible arts of my work
to make gold from garbage is not the alchemical point of this math
but truth be told its the pursuit of gold that turns the goal of men into trash
the souls gold and they turning gold into cash

three hots and a cot and some cops
trying to find dinosaurs in the bible

now bring it out
like a finger in the back of your mouth
cherubs and cerebellum terror is everywhere
sam marrying sam
bam pushed upon the finger of sams hairiest hand
if that sickens you you a bigot
if it doesnt well youre wicked
such is life
odd as egg mcmuffins at night
no answers so let us watch these dancers
structure reformed gracefully being born
on the pallet of dark greys concaves and spirals
kaleidoscope into a eiffel
it ripples then it tidals
vacillates then it virals
babylons in the bibles and others
and tell me of the spinning mothers
and todays mathematics for beloved
and beasts bellies covered like the cummerbunds of butlers

how was your day can i make what you say
what i wanna hear cause i want you here
the hell that we raised to the heavens do anything for
la petite mort la petite mort

[verse 2 lupe fiasco]
they keep the bottles just to make glass houses
then climb up to the second floors and throw rocks out it
then expect not a volley in reply
some place vulnerable like prolly in the eye
what of the chicken what is it missin is it dry
did it die in some inhumane conditions so it didnt go relaxed
and attention from its demise pulled all of the flavour from the fat
and made it flat and rather lifeless
well theres a place that has a stunning []
and more mercifully murdered pisces
but barbaric are still the prices
its rather niceless apricot in dices and fromage slices
my son will call risotto rices
if and when hes left to his own devices well
how is your memory
is it returning like a lemon tree
to bear bitter fruit of what you meant to me
or was it slippin like permission am i trippin like phil
i feel im grippin but maybe the transition
still left out the life also left out the will grief
will cheese never touch your teeth
maybe like kosher beef
is it real is it real is it real
ha hah

[hook 2 nikki jean]
how at the date can i make you my break
cause i want you dear ooh i want you dear
the hell that we raised to the heavens make [] for
our petite mort our petite mort

[verse 3 lupe fiasco]
so glad youre back but not glad at that youre []
where is the glamour in collapse
where in the shatter of the facts shoves one back to a pattern of stab wounds
swoon ridden goons consumed and driven mad soon
the attended years slowly fills with baboons
that other monkey business
where killers go free cause a junkies a funky witness
runny mascaras from the cunning mask wearers of death
bygone errors sittin like two oil derricks
separated by a sea of cooling num nums
reminiscing of an every day playing hum drum
where recognition went unnoticed
and then solidified till it was stoic
we shouldve been poets
somewhere between amateurs and grandmasters of iambic pentameter

[hook 3 nikki jean]
how are your chains do they make you behave
keep you over here by your overseer
fallen from grace down from heaven to memories []
la petite mort la petite mort[intro]
it’s for the love
cause we love you so much
keep it real
i don’t feel feel love
you don’t feel what i feel so
it all started out

[verse 1]
see first they had patience
and the nigga had energy
but not weak he finna leave
petal to the metal you finna speed
you remind me of a magi
but off in the future and what it’s finna be
all your memories can become enemies
so let’s intercede i know you in the seat
but let’s get outta there

[hook 1 nikki jean &amp; lupe fiasco]
but then that patience turned to waiting
and then that waitin’ turned to wasting my time my time my time
and then that wasting turned to hating
and then that hating got to racing
all around my mind my mind my mind

[hook 2 nikki jean &amp; lupe fiasco]
so before we hit a wall heartbreak and it crashes
just walk away no scratches

[verse 2 lupe fiasco]
see first they had patience
but niggas start sick niggas start gettin’ ill
niggas got cold feet niggas start gettin’ chills
niggas start stayin’ home cause niggas start gettin’ bills
buildin’ up an immunity
niggas stopped getting’ hurt
niggas relied on faith
hopin’ niggas get healed is hopeless nigga get real
but ah get back on the pill
we in it for the feel
but even winners can [] patience

not an earl diss either but he might think it be and be like
lus new should be mrpure 2positive shakur and 2 be sure hes

it really means he gave himself a cup twice
you just witnessed a double a probable odd future diss in the future

ignorance that the world isnt ours the god
give them all showers
toni found the fountain of youth in the mountain of power
to only find truth in the fountain drowning in power
surrounded with dollars
the moon surrounds us like spoons moving chowder
cut thats a mis-direct to stir the soul with dis-effect
names dont last like mr x
unless you galilee dropping bowling balls on the discotheque
with a disco ball hanging round your neck
dance its a new year
every time i open my hands
thoughts moving circles and the thoughts universal
yokozunas dont saw in a circle
sumo you up off off your turf boy
tsunami you up off your surfboard
[] medusa in the go
fore versace turned words into turquoise
medusa turned coke into stone
with a hand on her thigh she looked me in the eye and said
proceed to the next level

[hook troi]
sounds so far seems so much
tron
i cannot settle for good enough
so ill sweat and ill climb until i reach my prime
proceed to the next level
the forces rise and fall again
throw it up will i reach the end
in my eyes theres a fire and it takes me high

[verse 3 ab-soul]
uh
soulo
shoot for the moon even if you miss youll be among the stars space
backstroke in my pool of thought but dont mind the sharks wavy
ab-solar system intergalactic soldier
lupe say ima stoner i say that im much bolder
trapped in a game where the trap is the game
scope this horror aquariuss make it rain here
no love for your honor only god can judge us
if your islamic allah ive had enough to my collar
with these niggas cast in stones like this mancala
proceed to the next level dig that with a platinum shovel
black magic matter of fact if matter is fact
a matter factory is in the making perhaps
uh erase your database
we race against time no time to set a date
tetsuo and youth induced
too cool for school unloose the noose and

[refrain]

[outro troi]
with
next level next floor
im ready for it
ive been waiting all my life
tron tron
were going up were going up
