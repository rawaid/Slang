verse one raekwon the chef
i grew up on the crime side the new york times side
staying alive was no jive
at second hands moms bounced on old men
so then we moved to shaolin land
a young youth yo rockin the gold tooth lo goose
only way i begin to gee off was drug loot
and lets start it like this son rollin with this one
and that one pullin out gats for fun
but it was just a dream for the teen who was a fiend
started smokin woolies at sixteen
and running up in gates and doing hits for high stakes
making my way on fire escapes
no question i would speed for cracks and weed
the combination made my eyes bleed
no question i would flow off and try to get the dough all
sticking up white boys in ball courts
my life got no better same damn lo sweater
times is ruff and tuff like leather
figured out i went the wrong route
so i got with a sick ass click and went all out

and stay awake to the ways of the world cause shit is deep
a man with a dream with plans to make c r e a m
which failed; i went to jail at the age of 15
a young buck sellin drugs and such who never had much
trying to get a clutch at what i could not could not
the court played me short now i face incarceration
pacin - going up states my destination
handcuffed in back of a bus forty of us
life as a shorty shouldnt be so rough
but as the world turns i learned life is hell
living in the world no different from a cell
everyday i escape from jakes givin chase sellin base
smokin bones in the staircase
though i dont know why i chose to smoke cess
i guess thats the time when im not depressed
but im still depressed and i ask whats it worth
ready to give up so i seek the old earth
who explained working hard may help you maintain
to learn to overcome the heartaches and pain
we got stickup kids corrupt cops and crack rocks
and stray shots all on the block that stays hot
leave it up to me while i be living proof
to kick the truth to the young black youth
but shortys running wild smokin cess drinkin beer
and aint trying to hear what im kickin in his ear
neglected but now but yo it gots to be accepted

money splattered him bow then he snatched the bag
in his pockets then he jetted up the ave
girls screamin the noise up and down the block
hey rakeem what your little brother got shot
i ran frantically then i dropped down to his feet
i saw the blood all over the hot concrete
i picked him up then i held him by his head
his eyes shut thats when i knew he was
aw man how do i say goodbye

and you cant see him with the physical eyes
theyre also known as blood suckers of the poor
save the children
and then you got the five percent
who are the poor rightous people who do not believe
the teachers of the ten percent
save the children
who is all wise and know that the true
and living god and teach that the true
and living god is supreme being black
man from within
otherwise known as civilized people

billy johnson snatched him out his whip in times square

this souped up individual stuck the new stuff
same kid cryin on the stand with judge cuffner
kissed him with art num its three to nine style
before he left he flashin his face like denzel
richard dale took his beaver off the wall pullin his whip
mussy dropped and split his wig with the heater
his safe butt was all fucked up as he had me laughin
god you see how he was laid out in the grass
with dirt in his mouth slim woke him up told him he wild out
blood leakin from his teeth he smiled like he gunned out
big bolo stackin his shit financed a volvo

verse one the genius/gza
yo too many songs weak rhymes thats mad long
make it brief son half short and twice strong
no doubt it took time searchin eventually
it was prime urgent for you to examine the rhyme merchant
lace mcs with styles when they rhyme drunk
on a label hunt until twenty thou out the trunk

rza throw in the disc but then change the bank source
you cant flow must be the speech impediment
you got lost off the snare off impeach the president
whether in amsterdam smokin seven grams of green
then you pack a thousand white teens in tight jeans
this witty unpredictable shot is critical
to analytical analogy insurance policies why
said he know that sounds define the note
couldnt recognize blast him the fuck behind the ropes
too many dope niggaz i see starvin
catch a single deal a possible plea bargain
wu slay regardles to whom or what five mics five nights
hang him from the balcony drop twenty-five flights
a fugitive bass playin rap czar
smoke the cigars his prints on the strings of his guitar

rhymes filtered through the net before words hit the chrome
pro tools editing tracks thats rough
cause a jam without a live mc isnt enough
so we attack this and grab all within reach
throw a scrap back to niggaz - perfect your own speech
shit is copper it aint worth the mic stands
used by backup singers in atlantic city bands
niggaz look on and get hooked on this mic line
real thin and shift through the pipeline
lps delivered with style and potential
niggaz flowin smoothly in a sequential
order revealin hidden tape recorders
stashed inside pockets of those who lack aura

[verse three raekwon the chef]

yo mcs wonder whats hip-hop thunder

gettin down for the funk of it
like fred sanford in the biz
yo one held his paraphenalia a wu memorabilia
mailed by the fortune teller tried to tell ya
bout the group recruit we scoop up cream like breyers
then spread across the globe like telephone wires
thirty-six assorted shaolin imported
chambers been recorded youre fuckin with the loops
time for royalty audit
fabulous establishment metabolism blackfoot indian
cherokee started out smaller than amphibian
then grew to a physical body with five meridians
as the pendulum swings closer to the millenium
two thousand wickedness is spread amongst my citizen
i got a muscle the industrial to make a hustle
and politic with leo and russell
when niggaz is still rushin well brush you

hes a womanizer but hes an expert at throwing knives

[verse five masta killa]
thoughts are contained in the trenches of the brain
ignite blowin the mic to arabian heights
as i recite this medley niggaz couldnt fuck with the
deadly ground i hold down
classical gangland style shots hit the ceiling
panic and confusion echoes through the building
continuing to build i strive for perfection
driven by the will to live glocks i hold
shots i give while searchers of rescue teams
look for means of survival and whos liable
for this harrowing experience
you scream for the extreme fiend for the cap
and proceeds of the wu-tang academy
to fuck up your anatomy with assault and battery

tire scars from skid marks leaves from jams in school parks
witness forget his original statement
even in protection programs theres no escapement
gunned down we in town hit king from seven crowns
spent rounds catch him while he rhyme in the zebra lounge
wounded back in the eighty-three summer heat
up in three-oh-nine park rhymin off the drummers beat
i stalk the city streets demonstratin mic wrecks
all lookin stank i aint playin wit a full deck
and as they nervously stare i know they scared
they saw the coming of wu the neon in times square
household name assassin killa bee
mill to the grain that posess the wu trilogy
quick to spot those that bite camoflouge and blend
those that got styles they got identical twins
dont stretch the small thing copycats are finnicky
without skills they master the art of mimicry
but i go line for line on the whole page
your unspotted life on the mic is old age

verse four rza

suicidal she been in more hotels than bibles
idle worshippin bitch wasnt the type to make bridle
sprung on how the bitch maneuvered her tongue
from the top of his dick to the bottom of his ass split
i told the god to jet quick this wicked bitch was a harlot
but had him trapped up inside the charlotte web
she wasnt choosy fucked for movie and a loose leaf
cigarette pussy stay wet and juicy like lemons
big ass in tight denim
had the most faithful niggaz sinnin against their women
and enjoyed to watch relationships get destroyed
this unemployed welfare bitch was non-void
and shameless her attitude was blameless
even though she had a hundred dicks on her namelist
her obsession caused niggaz to get the ass cheek injection
the bitched lied said she had urinary tract infection
i tried to warn em and bomb em but she conned em
wanted niggaz to fuck her raw dog without no condom

yo this goes for all my brothers and sisters locked down
for all my peoples incarcerated for those who aint make it

yo in the housing thousands seen early graves
victims of wordly ways memories stays engraved
all my live brothers is locked down with high numbers
the young hunger blind to these lies they die younger
in this new world the order slaughter men women and children
ten feet gates surround the building keep us sealed in
the projects lifeless like a vietnam vet
constant war sever threats of enemy conquest
crooked cops comb my building complex thats in the rumble
streets are like a jungle cant let my cypher crumble
vivid thoughts devils resort to trick knowledge
they kick garbage lust for chicks and quick dollars
i know the pain the game bring i did the same thing
spaced out in the staircase performing a sting
its hard to keep control i bless those who seek a scroll
trying to reach a whole nation and break the sleeper hold
not a role model i walk a hard role to follow
i sold bottles of sorrow then chose poems and novels
the gospel was told some souls it swallowed whole
mentally they fold and they eventually sold
their life and times deadly like the virus design
but too minute to dilute the science is mine

a voice cries from the wilderness of the north
a representation of the families that lost one
all victims of incarceration
or other divisions of the family structure
youths are injected with serums that leads
to skin irritations babies being born with
disfigurations experimentations
on their faces there bear world relations
of mothers that carry the pain
of blood stained streets where sisters mourn and wail
fifth brothers been slain from hails of gun fire
it lightly begins to rain screams of terror
are hidden by the passing trains
this cant be little shane his uncle cried
as he drops to his nephews side holding his cane
just give me a name of who has inflicted this
bitter sickness and left us to witness

yeah yo
curses from war innocent blood spills for days
soothe in godly ways hands solemn in praise
tree of life more precious than wu is golden game
the wise self flourish inherit halls of fame
crime visions in my blood got me locked in prison
while we die hard living people whine about religion vision
blow spin and sin and killing whats revealing
its a never ending battle with no ending or beginning listen
zero process progress become the hunted
americas most wanted good life flaunted want it
some love the speed some satisfy a need
some want to be down young gun seed jungle breed
the stronger speed someone die someone bleed
one flew astray and then caught my little seed
can it be the ice have us trife life made me grab the knife
the righteous man would be within these stripes pipes
take in my energy breath and know the rest
cause the good die young and the hard die best

can a devil fool a muslim nowadays

took two drags off the blunts and started breaking down the flag
the blue is for the crips the red is for the bloods

or the slugs that ignites through the night by the dawn
early light why is sons fighting for the stripe

as we dwell through this concrete hell calling it home
mama say take your time young man and build your own
dont wind up like your old dad
still searching for them glory days he never had
so many bad want to scheme for american dream no more kings
the cash rule everything now we going down
these babies looking up to us its up to us
the million man march mcs get on the bus
but envy greed lust and hate separate
though the devil mind state blood kin cannot relate

battle-scarred shogun explosion when my pen hits
tremendous ultra-violet shine blind forensics
i inspect view through the future see millenium
killa beez sold fifty gold sixty platinum
shacklin the masses with drastic rap tactics
graphic displays melt the steel like blacksmiths
black wu jackets queen beez ease the guns in
rumble wit patrolmen tear gas laced the function
heads by the score take flight incite a war
chicks hit the floor diehard fans demand more
behold the bold soldier control the globe slowly
proceeds to blow swingin swords like shinobi
stomp grounds and pound footprints in solid rock
wu got it locked performin live on you hottest block

method man
as the world turn i spread like germs
bless the globe with the pestilence da hard-headed never learn
its my testament to those burned
play my position in the game of life standing firm
on foreign land jump the gun out the frying pan into the fire
transform into the ghostrider a six-pack
in a streetcar named desire who got my back
in the line of fire holdin back what
my people if you wit me where the fuck you at
niggaz is strapped and they tryin a twist my beer cap 
its court adjourned for the bad seed from bad sperm 
herb got my wig fried like a bad perm; what the blood-

the track renders helpless and suffers from multiple stab wounds
and leaks sounds thats heard

to represent the nation this is a gathering
of the masses that come to pay respects to the wu-tang clan
as we engage in battle 
the crowd now screams in rage 
the high chief jamel-ah-rief takes the stage
light is provided through sparks of energy
from the mind that travels in rhyme form
giving sight to the blind
the dumb are mostly intrigued by the drum
death only one can save shell from
this relentless attack of the track spares none

ghostface killah
yo yo yo fuck that look at all these crab niggaz laid back
lampin like them gray and black pumas on my mans rack
codeine was forced in your drink you had a navy dream 
salamander fiend bitches never heard you scream
you two-faces scum of the slum i got your whole body numb
blowing like shalamar in eighty-one
sound convincin thousand dollar court by convention
hands like sonny liston get fly permission 
hold tha fuck up allah fasten your wig bad luck
i humiliate separate the english from the dutch
its me black noble drew ali came in threes 
we like the genovese is that so caesar needs the greens
its earth ninety-three million miles from the first
rough turbulence the waveburst split the megahertz

aiyyo dats amazing gun in your mouth talk verbal foul hawk

swift notarizer wu-tang all up in the high-riser
new york gank adviser world tranquilizer

while my pen blow lines ferocious
mediterranean see ya the number one traffic sit down the beat god

verse one rza

fusion of the five elements to search for the higher intelligence
women walk around celibate livin irrelevant
the most benelovent king communicatin through your dreams
mental pictures been painted allahs heard and seen
everywhere throughout your surroundin atmosphere
troposphere thermosphere stratosphere
can you imagine from one single idea everything appeared here
understanding makes my truth crystal clear
innocent black immigrants locked in housing tenemants
eighty-five percent tenants depend on welfare recipients
stapletons been stamped as a concentration camp
at night i walk through third eye is bright as a street lamp
electric microbes robotic probes
taking telescope pictures of globe babies getting pierced with microchips
stuffed inside their earlobes then examinated
blood contaminated vaccinated lives fabricated
exaggerated authorization food and drug administration
testin poison in prison population
my occupation to stop the innauguration of satan
some claim that it was reagan so i come to slay men
like bartholemew cause every particle is physical article
was diabolical to the last visible molecule
a space night like rom consume planets like unicron
blasting photon bombs from the arm like galvatron

verse two u-god

united nations gun fire style patient
formulatin rap plural acapella occupation
conquer land like napoleon military bomb fest
we want sanitary food planetary conquest
thug peoples on some hardco body shit
get your shit together fore the fuck illuminati hit
dreams is free in escape of sleep
for a fool peep jewels keep tools for tough time
the rule of rough mind elevate stay behind
the sun gotta shine keep on cremate
the whole babylon times up move on
kings on your pawn checkmate no fakes
opposed through the gate case closed
things get froze when it comes time chosen ones
were holding guns we take flight with no fright
and attack never fear cause our words is clear
whats been done cant be undone son we cant care
cause the last days and times are surely here
snakes and flakes get blown by the rightous ones
divine minds bind we unified as one
half of black hope we half broke smoke a bowl of weed shit
our everlastin answers stay flyin over egypt

chorus tekitha

for you to defeat the gods
impossible you can never defeat
the gods impossible
for you to defeat the gods

verse three ghostface killah

call an ambulance jamie been shot word to kemit
dont go son nigga you my motherfuckin heart

blood comin out his mouth he bleedin badly
nahhh jamie dont start that shit
keep your head up if you escape hell we gettin fucked up
when we was eight we went to bat day to see the yanks
in sixty-nine his father and mines they robbed banks
he pointed to the charm on his neck
with his last bit of energy left told me rock it with respect
i opened it seen the god holdin his kids
photogenic tears just burst out my wig
plus he dropped one oh shit here come his old earth
with no shoes on screamin holdin her breasts with a gown on
she fell and then lightly touched his jaw kissed him
rubbed his hair turned around the ambulance was there
plus the blue coats officer lough took it as a joke
weeks ago he strip-searched the god and gave him back his coke
bitches yellin beenie man swung on helen
in the back of a cop car dirty tarts are tellin
but suddenly a chill came through it was weird
felt like my man was cast out my heaven now we share
laid on the stretcher blood on his wallys like ketchup
deep like the full assassination with a sketch of it
it cant be from yohoo to lees
second grade humped the teachers about to leave
finally this closed chapter comes to an end
he was announced pronounced dead yall at twelve ten

outro raekwon and tekitha

little ghetto boy playin in the ghetto street

what you gonna do when you grow up and have to face responsibility

little ghetto boy playin in the ghetto street
what you gonna do when you grow up and have to face responsibility

tired of yall mostly inspired by yall
so what the deal now blinking with us or put your shield down
faggot fuck fuck around punk 715 we battle for cream nigga

you want to pound crab nah let his hand swing
i ought to punch a hole in his palm with these pointy ass rings

when i saw the four four reflecting off your shiny forehead
its wu-tang nigga aint nothing changed nigga
still shame on a nigga who tried to run game
get virgin and perversions fucking bitches with persian
bugs watching niggaz like the turgeon its the surgeon slugs
still pounds when bobby steels 12 gauge gonna pay deadly chronicles
we held up in gotham take heed and protect your seeds
we fall like all the leaves who lack tranquility
in your rap utility to fuck with the abilities
raised like a sperm cell to the ovary
microphone post tone like a rotary phone
age of poems and poetry old sloans
explosive head bullets black hooded
timbaland footed ninjas who full metal jacket clips
and know how to put it in you
surrender your goods and your merchandise
for no purchase price im certainly a heist
for your ice and curtains and vice
come quietly wu-tang clan rules society
because of variety so maintain your high anxiety
and lead them to defy me diary
i need 18 points for my next joint
this high anointed king to make a deal
i be the one to appoint steve ripken must have been sniffing
to catch something so dope it left monica lynchs pussy dripping
i fuck hundreds of bitches and split millions of dollars
and built with thousands of scholars
my life saga from the hill to the harbor
legal kid brown in nicaragua
gave birth to mcs theives and bank robbers
we drove with pistol whips into world-wide trips
and my dicks been sucked by the finest lips
stand to tell the contestants in the worlds best repressment
but none of the above compare to the one-twenty lessons
or my queen and my seeds in the home that i rest in
enter my zone get blown to 99 sections

die *sounds of fighting are heard*

verse one street life
so get your egg crashed by my hellz wind staff
while the feature broadcast is splashed to tell the news
like kaity chung how the bullet collapsed his lung
his father watched the horror as he swallowed his tongue
another youth dead before the age of twenty-one
left his son to grow in the ghettoes of the slums
with a shot that go for twisted metal for cash flow
react slow nigga and get plo
by the lone gunner who took revenge for his brother
who got slain last summer by a cocaine runner
a new year is dawning new crews is forming
rival gangs warring blood steadily pouring
the streets are deep son every day is like a rerun
so i reach out and try to teach one
but eighty-five percent uncivilized content
no tolerance so a lifetime is spent
behind a cage bent smoked out on a park bench
killer instinct slave rap niggaz get lynched

{*sounds of fighting*}

verse two ghostface killah
so yo break that nigga arm fast as a fuck
tell ra goldie left my beige jacket in his truck
to all you slow footed penguins duckin from these
hot rocks thats flamin chocolate for all you rap damians
spraying cards ex-pionage dodgeball square hard
strip bars no bras wet leotards
and a mink in next album blood on chefs apron
keep a gambino playstation in your playpen
discovery channel cats that book at daniel
coke blunts hot as a fuck swatted bamboo
high school dropouts baseheads get knocked the fuck out
on the regular for robbin a good nigga house
rough cut raw doses the unexplainable
hot rock lava gringo throw the flows iglasa

{*sounds of fighting*}

verse three inspectah deck
ha ha ha ha yo
what you know about this specialist armed dangerous
hit you close range with this madness
unique design shine like a deep dish
the beat kick technique split all your weak shit
yes the rhythm the rebel
alone in my level heat it up past the boiling point of metal
living legend veteran known to set trend
lethal weapon step through your section
with the force like luke skywalker
rhyme author orchestrate mind torture
live performer bit the mic sayanora
borderline to insane i rain firewater
tape recorder cant be saved by a court order
i got my sword cross your throat you joke

verse four method man
we on the run with the golden guns get you none
when it reach out and teach someone blaze they buns
now im guilty by association
times of blackness eclipsin the sun target practice
commence when i throw these darts at these rappers
ricochet hit the charts bloody your matress
hold me down wu bloodkin im goin in
shootin bullets at the top ten rhyme concoction
blend like a million
all these niggaz want cheese is we mice or men word up
we can go platinum but then still cant get no satisfaction
once again back on the block crumb snatchin
blowin backs in cold
blunted non-assassin time for action johnny unidas
handle that like arthritis
still hold a golden touch like king midas

{*swords clash*}

verse five rza
drown in problems the heinekens imported from holland
gettin boosted off a killer bee pollen stone columns
get trapped by drum tracks mac loud as gun claps
penll grab the death of a thousand dumb tacks
the wu sensai fold it beez the wind ninja scroll
soul edged blade controls your inner pole
the thick loop fruit from the forbidden tree root
i stay secluded in the chamber trainin new recruits
with fatal guillotine the black hooded team what it means
when bullets scream from the hot glock like rock from a sling
sometimes pushed through like george bush operation whoops
shots get popped on the block cause them blood to gush
from digital to analog the wu-wear camoflogue
the entourage squad we stompin through zanzibar
like herds of cattle rza plays the wall like a shadow
connectin brooklyn/shaol like the verrazanno-narrows

verse six raekwon the chef
stash the cream though iceatollah ice style gleama
lex graffiti name reamer hold em we rollin
askin me though raps is hotter than hot tamales in toledo

scold em and fold em like the thousand dollar bills
sit back eyein yall niggaz out
fakes that delegate we spittin fire out
verb burgular design the wally shoe store reserve
a jet status guidin these vert up on my matress
watch me mack this ralph lauren goose inside a fashion

fiends were never waiting in the hill
they ran one step ahead
but the jiggy was always there

upon the project pavement
there was death enslavement of the mind
single mothers are filled with stress

as i lay there with my baby
we would look from the window and cry
then suddenly in the sky

between the new world ages
we were blessed and wu-tang fills the ear
with the melody of a train lord is suddenly here

false mcs are melting

peace to the gods we got a heavy job yo yo

trouble follows behind a wicked mind 20/20 vision
of the prism of light but still blind
because you lack the inner every sinner
will end up in the everlastin winter of hellfire
throw on this mix just picks your third eye out
you cry out your words fly out and sounds die out
you remain unheard sufferin eternally internal external
along with your wicked fraternal from generals to colonels
releasin thermonuclear heat that burns you firmly
and permanently upon this journey
through the journal of the book of life
those who took a life without justice
will become just ice ice ice
its been taught that your worst enemy can harm you
as much as your own wicked thoughts
what devils fought we wrought and lets annoint
now youre bein persecuted by that universal court court court
iron hell with the strong blend of rape and blend of sandal
with rose petals and jasmine as men use talismans
burn some incense chantin witchcraft to reach high dimensions
im convinced allah is god always has been always will be
you could travel every square inch of the planet earth and still be
ninety-three million miles away from the sun
til you realize you and the sun is one like the knowledge
know the ledge to where your heart is
or fall off into the internal hell thats uncharted
light travels at the rate of 186000 miles per second
through time and space until it reach a target
and once were freed of darkness and show em where the path
yo as the red sea was parted into these straight
at the narrow gate but why thats a road to destruction and hate
what you thought life was a sport a game
one hundred years short know the soul is immortal
walk through many portals and those who go astray
will pay a judgment day and these few years of wicked bullshit
aint worth the eternity inside a sulfur lake
with dragons and snakes and any pain you can imaginate
instead i chose to become a newlywed to the true bread
of life and fed god degree of light to my head
its been said the fool who sleep is already dead so i stay awake
and take care of my brother and uncover reveal the skin
so we can see each other cause every color
that makes the light appear duller whos the colored man
whos the original whos the biochemical
whos the grafted digital digital digital digital
digital yo yo yo yo yo

two hundred thousand million atmosphere cubic feet of air we breath
while niggaz minds are trapped twenty thousand fathoms beneath
the sea of reality they cant inhale deep devils have em
stagnant a trapping the 45 magnum
and shatter bone fragments
cops love the block you gettin backed up by dragnet
thrown into a six by eight steel cabinet
flippin weights readin ancient tablets back on the block nobodys havin it
those who havent learnt get returned
you freaky ass niggaz get burned
some walk around like they aint concerned
with the hell goin on inside the world
why do grown men molest little girls
is it because the girls breast has swelled
to the size of a woman although shes twelve
the whole world is sick sick sick
trapped up in six six six
i started off as a pawn in this marathon of life
tryin to carry on wishin i had a bomb to blow up babylon
a vagabond tryin to steal his corpse were from paragon
goin in circles like a ferris wheel
undernourished meals i cherish hope drown inside the sea of life
use my third eye for a periscope and take flight to the edge of night
to far heights so dark that even wit a bright light
you couldnt see a spark of light
while others play ball i recall me and gza dirty
hangin in halls bangin on walls
kickin rhymes three hours straight with no pause
boostin from freeport sunrise to amityville morgue
kept razorblade between the jaws breakin all laws
started out writin fables to makin beats on lunchroom tables
to wearin long cables that hung down to the navel
so pack some crack and fat sacks of skunk
to funnel the p-funk smokin woolie blunts
dust cocktails and primos shot more dice than casinos
back when wu-gambinos were called foi mcs
all and together now crew bcc
rec posse gp dmd
ol dirty stalked east new york gza maintained franklin lane
i was going to thomas the jeff where students got slain
old earth got nervous walked me to shaolin sent me to curtis
took share time in marquis u-god general contractin service
while meth chef and deck was off the nu-dol
for white boys who took steroids
buildin up bicep tricep pectoids and deltoids
back when our girlfriends was virgins
cuttin class with ghost tryin to bag hoes in mary birchem
a maybeldine beacon night school washington irving
these young gods was seekin
hoes in westinghouse and clara parton and medina
girls who sung like sarafina
on the corner of belmont and picket avenue i seen her
as if i dreamed her
i was dead broke now i will use key notes to make g-notes
so its always hope
see subway train run through the city like blood through the veins
to the heart of medina but shaolin is the brain
so take heed to these words
and feel the power of the sunshower

approachin the final hour

&lt;i&gt;verse 1

simultaneous anger to this life im no stranger
galaxy mission to attack in the track black
diplomats in the world called rapture
death was a concept i didnt want to capture
the laughter singing over mantress d
street colleagues slow up
their man got tow up
guts be throw up sipping on rum
we sing from the creed of a beggers last son
cash fast fun no life undone
take what you need son cause you daddy made mo than one
and it was fun till reality formed screaming
&gt;from a palace where the weathers warm
yo you have to be the father and the lord of the score
used to hover here now its cutting your vocal cord
no mo speaking the lies to the weak
cause im about killing these guys with my feet
today its a stage maybe later its a cosmic course
the general i be rocking on the horse
on the strength of course dont let it be in vain
cause its time for the beggaz to reign remain

&lt;i&gt;verse 2

a vision my facility a death world trilogy you see that shit
now fictional plots speak out through gunshots
battles won and lost at the of heavens throne
the sky rains blood drowning the earth with red mud
i be sitting on the edge of mars counting stars
finding me a place in space unchaseable
no mortal cant fulfill such skill they incapable
of keeping all the planets in-line with one mind
make the sun and moon both shine at one time
i orchestrate the guns that air for gods sake
precipitate make rain hail snow and earthquake
levitate the gravitational pull of haleys comet
shake the chords of earth make a euro-volacanic vomit
ebonic with sonic waves that blaze the human flesh
it flames extra-terrestrial its time to reap professional
feel the untestable force burning your course
hints of visible thoughts be the source of begga sorcery
begga sorcery

&lt;i&gt;chorus 
on the strength
time is money and gain
on the strength
math is one and the same
on the strength
whining is something for pain
on the strength
beggaz for ever remain
&lt;i&gt;repeat 

&lt;i&gt;verse 3

buddah hava who lives the ways by nature
escape on a galactic space caper
to the nexus transportation a glass lexus
forever present is wu chi in the essence
of life is immortal
we travel through portals thats phenomenon
paragon through the octagon
my chi gong is calm express through alvatron
love hell alright is the day destroys the night
knife divides today feathers are harmonious
and universal ways to escapades
we take what we need to survive and stay alive
draw more sometimes as we break through the other side

&lt;i&gt;verse 4

intro
feel this
to all those races colors and creeds every man bleeds
for the countless victims and all their families
of the murdered tortured and slaved raped
robbed and persecuted - never again
to the men women and children
who died and struggled to live never to be forgotten

hebrew man praying

verse 1
reuven ben menahem*
yo my own blood
dragged through the mud
perished in my heart still cherished and loved
stripped of our pride everything we lived for
families cried
theres no where to run to no where to hide
tossed to the side
access denied
6 million died for what
yo a man shot dead in his back
helpless women and children under constant attack
for no reason
till the next season
and we still bleeding
yo its freezing
and men burn in hell some for squeezing
no hope for a remedy nothing to believe
moving targets who walk with the star in their sleeve
forever marked with a number tattooed to your body
late night eyes closed clutched to my shotty
having visions flashes of death camps and prisons no provisions
deceived by the devils decisions
forced into a slave
death before dishonor for those men who were brave
shot and sent to their grave
cant awaken its too late
everythings been taken
im shaken family history the making

chorus
never again shall we march like sheep to the slaughter
never again shall we sit and take orders
stripped of our culture
robbed of our name never again
raped of our freedom and thrown into the flames never again
forced from our families taken from our homes
moved from our god then burned of our bones
never again never again
shall we march like sheep to the slaughter never again
leave our sons and daughters
stripped of our culture
robbed of our name never again
raped of our freedom and thrown into the flames never again
forced from our families taken from our homes
moved from our god and everything we own
never again

verse 2
some fled through the rumors of wars
but most left were dead few escaped to the shores
with just 1 loaf of bread
banished hold in for questioning
and vanished
never to be seen again
i cant express the pain
that was felt on the train
to auscwitz tears poured down like rain
naked face to face
with the master race
hatred blood of david
my heart belongs to god and stay sacred
rabbis and priests
disabled individuals
the poor the scholars all labeled common criminals
mass extermination
total annihilation
shipped into the ghetto and prepared for liquidation
tortured and starved
innocent experiments
stripped down and carved up or gassed to death
the last hour i smelled the flowers
flashbacks of family then sent to the showers
powerless undressed
women with babies clumped tight to their chest
crying
who wouldve guessed dying
another life lost
count the cost
another body gas burned and tossed in the holocaust never again

chorus
never again shall we march like sheep to the slaughter
never again leave our sons and daughter
stripped of our culture
robbed of our name never again
raped of our freedom and thrown into the flames never again
forced from our families taken from our homesnever again
moved from own god and everything we owned
never again never again
shall we march like sheep to the slaughter never again
shall we sit and take orders
stripped of our culture
robbed of our name never again
raped of our freedom and thrown into the flames never again
forced from our families taken from our homes never again
moved from our god and burned of our bones
never again never again

never again
never again
the final solution
is now retribition

verse 1
an ordinary cat from outta projects
since i was younger though
mom raised her children
pops dipped a long time ago
in my mind i see flashbacks
i had no fancy clothes
skinny ugly notty head nigga cryin with a snotty nose
even though my father neglect he pay the child support
hadnt seen him all these years
i hug his ass in court
always sayin im comin to get you and i be waitin to
holiday and birthday presents was never comin through
member at the age 13 i started smokin weed
hangin out with cats that was older start to run the street
dropped outta high school sellin drugs impressin chicks
spent most my cheddar on gear
my man was buyin whips
new york jamaican miami niggaz
flooded virginia quick
cause signin work only if buyin
pressure was high as shit
member when i first got hit
i seen the iron spit
50 cash bend in one corner bleedin where pellet hit
my man shawnny hill doin strong
slug burnt through his lower back side
cracked his spine exit his arm
lost him twice on the hospital table
and when he died i cried my eyes out
i couldnt take it damn damn
but the same things continued to happen
niggaz got bust
im a kid with a grown mans mind turnin corrupt
playin innocent infront of my elders
i was runnin with them cats that be robbin to awkward man tell em
if my name was up in any type trouble
my moms would tell me
just like you brothers into some shit go get a job or somethin
just a little bum on the street
not workin hard for nuttin
scratch i made whenever pumpin
im here to offer somethin
makin sure the crib stay tight
for real i werent no dummy
simmy where you gettin this money
i wash a car be lyin
sayin anythin sides drugs sellin
my sister seen me on the block
transact with fiends sayin ima tell it
growin up was hell no doubt
i wonder where was heaven

women singin in the background

for real though
always look for that place call heaven
its never there
i seen my mans an em gets just get blasted
on the block

and my moms knew the type of shit i was goin through
cause i was a project kid

verse 2
now im a grown man
still its like life dealt me the wrong hand
cats that was my man be frontin
or either found dead

rememberin them long ten months from slengin crack bags
mom put me out with the quickness

my devastatin hot 97 mentality
keep me on point for my four-digit salary
heavyweight lyric never lost one calorie
im soon to be seen on the tv screen
gambino cappacino to the afro sheen
stay black where im at high road to rap council
splash love to wu in a orderly tonsil
never limit to the diction cause chaos to mixin
brutalize a sound check ripple through the intermission
raps under siege held tight like a squeeze
forced in the world donna nuclear freeze
through the damage to the wannabe flipmode and def squad
ruckus a whirlpool in the rap entourage
if you dare to test thirty-six chambers of strangers 
my word of mouth its all real wigs might peel
livin large and in charge branch out bon voyage
twenty-four diamond government named god
alias daryl hill bring thugs back to kill
circle around my son daryl jr never eatin large
auntie dauntie sixteen holdin me down
aids of rap music may be contagious to sound 
verbal the slang pushed back to create pronoun
method forcin j-love to bring the pain from underground
realizin food for thought is self-compromisin
shaolin cut the crack into a triple-o sizin
blue do what he do to keep that currency risin
hopin i catch a deal so we can catch a full wheel
instead of catchin bodies niggaz not keepin it real
dirtball niggaz that steal cake from stores
thats my type of niggaz i be wantin on my tours
cant help it my styles stay fat like roseanne
ruckus in the square i stay rough like the clan
panther on my arm pen and pad in my hand
punk motherf**kers better beware of the shaolin
defy interactive project children of the corn


gats and my man keep em bustin till hes gone
style so ancient it sparks just like the unicorn
donna come through everyday my uniform
changes and switches i came to make ladies out of bitches
crackhead niggaz get stitches
so what up with that kid danger when i attack kid
watch how the slang hits you just like the fat kid
form another pyramid look how we slid
all over park hill stapleton politic
on a twenty dollar bill all in it together
you cant f**k with the stormy weather yaknahmean

floatin on the 95 sting like a killer bee
your hands cant hit what your eyes cant see

gza
from dark matter to the big crunch
the vocals came in a bunch without one punch
rare glimpse from the strictly advanced proved unstoppable
reputation enhanced since the cause was probable
so you compare contrast but dont blast
through extreme depths with the pen i hold fast
watch the block thirst for one became all
shot em with the long forgotten rainfall
delivered in a vivid fashion with simplicity
the blind couldnt verify the authenticity
the rhyme came from the pressure of heat
then it was laid out on the ground to pave streets

light is shinin beauty sunshine
here comes one-time the ball was so fine
heat is blazin the kids were playin
his partner was shady tryin to slave the babies

ghostface killah
aiyyo they didnt know the cop was crooked he had blow out in brooklyn
all this while he let the fiends cook it
the baseheads stirred it up plus they got to blow it up
dropped it off in the pjs and they bigged it up
then one day shit jumped off real crazy
the middle of a bathroom they find an old lady
no clothes half of her tongue ear missin
the killer had to be mad smart he wore mittens
even though her leg was bitten
crackheads point the finger at detective slick morris gittins
paleface cop who done popped the desk
and got the chop on his neck from when he knocked celeste
it was a slug drug he pressured everybody on the block
some niggaz know him as the godson of gotti
and his black partner he was scared to speak
he saw how they planted weapons on these kids in the street
he saw like over fifty bodies in like fifty-two weeks
he saw his colleague pick up money before leavin his beat
they call him desk duty robocop
younger dudes call him freddy krugs from the way he walk on the block

chorus

raekwon the chef
heard the disturbance out the window oh shit they got my son
pulled over his tempo brenda dropped the endo
had her little nephew with her yo she didnt care
they always harassed her until she blew the captain with a razor
his partner turned red in his waist mase done smacked her
with the walkie yoked her then slammed her on her face
he bugged on her like she was drugged plugged one in her
the fifth relaxed her like a big thug pistol whipped her
heard she was dusted musta been the way they threw the cuffs on her
she broke the shits went and rushed the kid
wavin her hands she had a half an axe all in her tracks
he grabbed her by the air she broke his jaw it cracked
more cops arrived they both bloodied down by the five
wildest niggaz just smilin cause it look live
they gave her forty years in new orleans callin me 
shorty was young by three days had a great bid

chorus

gza
youre just worms in the worst part of the apple thats rotten
you squirm and you turn from the right still plottin
all slimy cause you stay grimy petty crimey cat
you sometime me dont need to remind me about
livin in the core with the scramblers in front of the store
the bum holdin the door the mugging no one saw
we played ball in the alley where dope was shot raw
and the school they kept flawed plus the lowest test scores
small percentage determined to strengthen they position
transformation from critical to stable condition
but it still be obstacles on niggaz thats optical
watchin you like salt-water sharks thats tropical
the money was the root and its the instinct to make it
with they pockets and fridge naked many aim to take it
whether - hold up set up stabbin or a wet up
just to know it was the kid next door fizzucked your head up
once he fell short frequently visit the courts
and for some another way out is music and sports
thats why i keep the rhyme just as fly as a shot
that won the championship with just oh on the clock

chorus - repeat 2xyou will be punished wu-tang style
for all your evil deeds wu-tang style
be warned - you will suffer wu-tang style
 justice wu-tang style

gza
slept on this hazardous enterprise
hit from the back from a long range attack in disguise
week self-captivity became months
those who were holdin it down they hold a pump
do we delay the conflict and prolong the suffer
got a mass of starvin niggaz wanna eat supper
unfair corruptions lead to abductions
creatin wider circles of destructions
so we attack with the pen and blaze in
from the terrifyin to the fascinating
quick to slay a narrow minded nigga thats hasty to give credit
full of hostile overtones mixed with wack edits
they heavily defended airfields
but they bodies rot behind punctured steels
when i greeted you you didnt hear a piece of my voice
oh that water was my liquid of choice
forensic couldnt tell it it was nine tons of steel pellet
powerful projection noise is deafening
carrier battle groups thats threatening
higher level bombing plus
the shipment in hand known as alarming bells ring loud
in the same crucial manner but different style

just when you thought we would fold our hand
against all odds we raised the bet like we changed the plans
it was live on air but in between station breaks
i was holdin a pair and just made the table stakes
split the demos put insurance on tapes
a safeguard against the crusaders in capes
if i double down they say the gods are sharks
if we win against the house they thought the cards was marked
we draw hit after hit from a royal flush menu
while the dealer promoted the full house venue
a spade in the club with the heart to wear diamonds
the high roller who got credit upon signin
they look puzzled when i shuffle most of em stunned by the hustle
recourse of bluff games your muscle

drivin the streets he kept heat on the night shifty
quickly who ring bells like its twelve on sunday
while the stage catch shells from forceful gunplay
mere fact that the track was a fierce counterattack
all those who couldnt multiply were sent back
no tanks low rank soldiers hittin the heart
tainted the heart of an empire was torn apart
brought to a halt from a front full assault
the chemist left the lab with undetermined results
they saw the swordsman sift electrical volts
the audience threw nuts with loose screws and bolts
the archives automatically changed ya stiff vibes
it was layin in the zip drive from chest five

from darkness to dna i move with my brother
and we resonate energy that shifts in colors
bringing mcs punishment then im done with it
the meter leave way on the fast break i run with it
it was not a hobby but a childhood passion
that had started in the lobby and was quicky fashioned
every line to line bar for bar is clockwork
hazardous and powerful enough to have your block hurt
check the total amount of mcs inflicted
with torture from moving with work thats restricted
we criticize producers til they joints are right
then acupuncture the track with pinpoints of light
hitting them from well conceiled firing positions
with explosiveness thatll make the deaf listen 
drastic pyroclastic connected with the same old

one man cant uplift the land

a mission impossible purely philosophical
but you call him on your death bed when you layin in the hospital

yo ive been highly misunderstood by those who met us
they had ears of corn and heads of lettuce
mentally dead essentially lead by the false teachings
and eventually pledge their allegiance
to that which was against them and exempt them from the truth
then juiced them and pimp them 
so the church can rise while their babies home hungry covered with flies
bzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
trying to harness the wind

raining with the patchwork of puzzles
that was written in the year of the dragon
more raw than you could ever imagine
how much of a great blessing to a rap city
where the youth is organically fed from the witty
unpredictable talent and natural game is lyrical
analyze the picture the portrait the visual

ragu nigga whose tomatoes are sundried
he gave yall niggaz whiplash from bling bling
but my rhymell give ya hot flash and moodswings

not trying to convince the pack that its a fact
for those who cant adapt i lived it shitted it back
we have agreed youll feel the impact of the truth when ill squeeze
the brain feels something pop hip hop locked in texts
fat checks fly whips jewelry chicks
enough kicks fitted crown buttoned down
underneath the white t lies the four pound
this is forty-five minutes of menacing
dismantling any mc opponent stepping in the zone
get ya face blown get ya face blown

i stay on the 64 squares while patrolling the center
trading space from material the time zone i enter
its calculated by movement from pushed pieces
advancements and development once the pawn reaches
to 8th ranked now heavily armed with a tank
my opponents base is threatend soldiers cut with shanks
moved all my small pieces mcs are driven back
unable to avoid capture from the attack
such movement is naturally quite unsound
men is badly placed upon dangerous grounds
loosening their position before they were strongly posted
before the double rooks had approached it
they must of been quick to ignore the principles
rock a v and an effective god is invincible
a strategic plan just the way i envisioned it
many fallen soldiers in complete imprisonment

you interrupt the grammys said wu for the kids
took four five shots when they rushed in your crib
 crack ya ribs cops shot ya whip
you been chased by the pigs on a four year bid
crashed cars still came out without a scar
they try to keep your free spirit trapped in a jar so youll keep your mouth shut
and wont tell the world whos who and whats what and prolly go nuts
