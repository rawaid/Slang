has turned me to a scandalous fiend
sticking your peeps for cream
gators or boots nigga im crushing your dreams

dismantling spleens til your whole cliques

just to make walking again a sympathetic dream
energetic schemes

getting at you whether you coming out
or you been out

or barricaded in a motel with twelve shotguns
when the *cops* come knocking

cocked ready to dump slugs heavy as shot puts
one man army
guns cant harm me
young and ornery
worse than my uncle ronnie
ever since i got my first gun pulled on me
i cant stop airing out my dirty laundry
middle fingers flip at censorship
your friends just flipped
over this swift penmanship
ever since i spit some shit on infinite
i been giving it a hundred and ten percent
cuz when i vent most of my energys
spent on enemies
eighty percent of what i invent is hennessy
and twenty percent is from being hungry as sin
ten is because i love being under your skin
ya shit shit can happen
so stick to rapping
quit the yapping
or ima lift the mac in
that can lead to another mishap happening

im black a fag and my dads liberace

kon artis
no matter how bad the beating
i went to school cheating
my dad whooped my ass at a pta meeting
skipping school i had to have nuts just to do it
got born and became truant
when i had the gaul to go
i just couldnt do it
i was lured into corners by this peer pressure shit
how would you feel if you was held
by the tip of a barrel
getting threatened to get your skin
ripped to bone marrow
bet suburban kids
never got rushed for their apparel like me
outcast
last to class
first to leave
when the teacher called on me
best believe
i had something up my sleeve

eminem
i been praised and labeled as crazy
my mother wasnt able to raise me
full of crazy rage
an angry teenager
nothing could change me back
gangsta rap made me act like a maniac
i was boosted and
so influenced by music
i used it as an excuse to do shit
ooh i was stupid
no one could tell me nothing
hip hop overwhelmed me
to the point where it had me in a whole nother realm
it was like isolating myself was healthy
it felt like we was on welfare but wealthy
compelled me to excel when school had failed me
expelled me
and when the principal would tell me i was nothing
and i wouldnt amount to shit
i made my first million and counted it
now look at it
a fucking drop-out that quit
stupid as shit
rich as fuck
and proud of it
thats why

it must have been poison in that niggas nutt

drunk as hell
having conversations with myself
you could tell i wasnt leniant

that slapped teachers

so i changed huh you got a phone

how come we dont even talk no more
and you dont even call no more
we dont barely keep in touch at all
and i dont even feel the same love when we hug no more
and i heard it through the grapevine we even beefin now
after all the years we been down aint no way no how
this bullshit cant be true
we family aint a damn thing changed unless its you

we were so young 
so full of life and vibrance 
side by side wherever you was riding i went
so close almost on some bonnie and clyde shit
when ronnie died you was right by my side 
with a shoulder to cry on and tissue to wipe my eyes 
and a bucket to catch ever tear i cried inside it 
you even had the same type of childhood i did 
sometimes i just wanna know why is it that you succaim to yours 
and mine i survived it you ran the streets i 9 to 5ed it 
we grew up grew apart as time went by us 
and i blew up to both yours and mines surprises
now i feel a vibe i just cant describe it
much as your pride tries to hide it youre cold
your touch is just like ice 
and your eyes is a look of resentment
i can sense it and i dont like it

how come we dont even talk no more
and you dont even call no more
we dont barely keep in touch at all
and i dont even feel the same love when we hug no more
and i heard it through the grapevine we even beefin now
after all the years we been down aint no way no how
this bullshit cant be true
we family aint a damn thing changed unless its you

kon artis

it was my dream at first to be off spitting a verse 
on my own album with a deal but shit got worse
fore i came out i woulda killed a nigga first
for i let him disrespect me or check me over some 
worthless bitch that i wasnt with
i woulda hit it and quit
but you were fitting to talk with her and tell her she was the shit
i told you dont get involved with her
you would smoke in the car with her
coming outta the bar with her
stumbling half drunk
like you were husband and wife or somethin
but me catching her fuckin other niggas musta hurt your pride or something
cause you were openin your mouth to people like you wanted with me
when all i tried to do was show that your bitch was shifty
and every sister fares and all the shit that i produced
you acting like i aint your man and lying like she cant be loose
but i am really your friend im just trying to tell ya the truth
dont hate the game or the player
the one thats changing is you

eminen

but proof is just acting out the part he was thrown 
shady made it so my babies aint starving at home 
see the devil in your glance 
since the ghetto we been friends forever real intellegence 
thats forever till the end 
i peep the hatred in your eyes and the satan in your lies 
aint wasting my time with these snakes in disguise 
how come when you talk its with bitter and spite
and how come its my fault for what you did with your life 
and everytime i go to hear you play you look away 
we barely embrace you cant even look me in my face

and he aint the type of dude to pop a e and get drunk 
and wave his heat all in the air like hes some dumb hoe punk

this nigger dyin over prizes to prove he got balls 
i play keyboards i dont play deep

cuz you laid a nigga down without any meat 
well my cops wont allow me to make decisions in vein

if you take it to that level i take it to whoever 
want to harm me and my family runyon avenue forever

verse 3 kuniva

and i love to kunive son and you left a live one

a maniac with anxiety attacks i dont wanna chat
speak when you spoken to and i dont have to read a fucking
magazine or quotable to notice what you hoes will do

[verse 2 - kuniva]

they found saddam but they aint gon find me
ill be under a tree in buttfuck tennessee
and i dont know too much about my daddy
except he spit in my face and fucked me in my fanny
i aint a racist i just hate whites
fags and dykes blacks and transvestites
thirteen years old and joined a fucking gang
hair under my ass cheeks feeling the fucking pain
am i insane who really knows
cause any second my temper can fucking blow
i get colder than december
black the fuck out tomorrow wont even remember
see bizarre can show you what violence is all about
and this dr dre beat done brought it the fuck out
run in your house and put a gun in your mouth
and blow your brains the fuck out

[verse 4 - eminem]
i probably got a screw loose or two or maybe three or four of em
some fell out and hit the floor
all i know is ever since my fucking head hit the snowbank
i been a little neanderthalish no thanks to my man dangelo bailey
but i just take it slow daily my biggest dilemmas
trying to figure whether to use the flat head or the phillips
or just go to the home depot and pick the new power drill up
gives me two hours and six days and im still up
i feel like im about to snap any minute
theres a new tower records about to stop and get a fill-up
pick the new cypress hill up
and go find who did that shit to xzibit
and go fill up a whole liquor bottle with piss
and shatter his fucking lips with it

[chorus - b-real]
im a little bit off the chain you can call me insane but the fact remains 
that im a pyscho
better get it through your brain when you say my name never say it in vain

your click made they trip i make them hoes suck mint
ask them girl they know the scoop dont fuck with bugz bitch
i chop off her titty have you sucking one tit
them pink belly niggas is who you run wit
making half-ass songs shitty snares and one kick
i hate your damn sound dont like it one bit
you could make a double album wont have one hit
your entire outfit is on some bullshit
and theres not a damn one that i cant outwit
i ad-mit that my style is unfit
for mommas baby boy because im on some dumb shit
like i commit larceny give harm quick
you pull the alarm switch i stab you in your armpit
now who the nitwit wanna come get wit
this egotistic hip-hop fundamentalistic
dont risk it you get your shit split
now keep your distance and keep existence
im persistent when it comes to bend shit
smoke the blunt with my judge right before my sentence
im relentless to deny is senseless
your bitch pay my bill thats where the hell your rent went
fuck that[intro]
dawg i shouldnt have left
they wouldnt have tried that shit if i was witchu
maybe we wouldve picked another time or maybe chose another way
or maybe my prayers wouldve convinced him to choose another soul
shiiit its just me and man tony now
man you look so peaceful right now
how can i argue with that
they say that the good die young

[hook kon artis]
they say that the good die young die young
thats why i think that you should have fun when youre young
cause time wont wait for no one uh-huh
when god calls you gotta go home go home
they say the good die young die young
thats why i know that we gon have fun huh
in this life cuz you only get one
when god call for me dont cry i just went home

[kon artis]
im sure that everybody heard their momma say it be days like this
when you see one of your friends die in the mist
in the struggle into the circumstances
a risk that they take just to prove a point to a friend
even then accidents are prone to happen
to any man or woman thats dumb enough to pretend it
huh god will hold em accountable for sins
that they commit and they try to repent the sins to repent
but i guess thats the way things go
i was blessed to see twenty-four
to wake up to that hi my name is video
motivated me to write what i wrote
and i knew my little brother sold dope
and mom and daddy wanted to move our row
i did it i still got a lot to prove and show
i just wish we aint have to lose bugz through the struggle
cause you know

[hook]

[bizarre]
i know you used to bizarre on some silly shit
but niggas in my clique is dying quick for real
in detriot niggas dont party
they pull a fo-fo out snatch off ducartis
thats why i keep the pistol under the truck
im 27 years old too old to be getting jumped
and fuck rap i miss karnail pitts
b-u-g-z tatted on my wrist
me and you in the jeep listen to scream-o beats
its a shame me and fuzz dont even speak
i got married my wife name is dee
peace to 31 and 5150 bitch

[kuniva]
i think back on that tragic day my phone rung
and bizarres voice telling me bugz was going home
it was like a knife piercing my chest and i couldnt breathe
i didnt wanna accept it didnt wanna believe it
i swear at his wake dog i cried so hard
literally denaun had to carry me to the car
while i stand in this booth now its tearing me apart
but i had to let it out cause it was tearing at my heart
cause he died over something so petty and so small
a human life is so very precious i hope yall
understand how im feeling cause i love you bugz
i wanna rhyme with you laugh with you hug you bugz
but i cant and you were so close to see your dreams
a coward came along and took you away from the team
so dont mistake this track as just another song
this goes out to everyone who lost a loved one
cause you know

[hook]

[proof]
they say its never too late to have an early childhood
if i could turn back the hands of time god should
forgive what i did as a kid that run blocks
now my dreams is just scream cops and gunshots
the fun stops when your homies up in the box
my duty bo rest assure snuffed by the cops
i used to court shit a lot if theres a guy id probably say something
if you love him so much why aint you gave nothing
but he took my homies slippers only in eleventh grade
now i hope to see his face at the heaven gates
it aint never late in the game satan remains
with a grudge to see slugs break through my frame
my heart aches with the pain the light limits breath
we got to have fun now theres only minutes left
and in death cause stress younguns is sucked in
to get tats for my fallen homies i aint got enough skin
miss yall

[hook]

[swift]
when i was younger i knew four brothers that wasnt wise
that crashed and the driver died my partner on the passenger side was paralyzed
and im surprised by the look of that ride that the other two survived
nine months later another one dies
somebody shot him in his side when he was starting up his ride
three years go by i made a hell of a run
and thats when funky got done joey playing with guns
and tookie over funds cardie was my man
and reggie i wish that i was with you in that van
and bugz if it wasnt for you

you cant help it but to imagine this walkin massacre
a madman strapped with a magnum blow that spasm out ya back
and just stand there and snatch your medallion
see i cant fear any nigga that can not happen
the immaculate mack handler
that got this wrappin by the back of his neck
a scavenger im a threat then you fear me like a hand full of syringes
im ill enough to scream at your front do blow it off the hinges
im marksmatic to press marksman outta walkin
cause soon your body can catch me shootin up your carcus
so dont provoke shit i wish the whole mankind was a neck so i can choke it
furocious and you aint gonna be knowin where ya folks is
f**k the milk cartons and posters its over they ghosts

[ verse 2 ] [ proof ]

niggaz is bitch instead of diggin a ditch
ima see how fill this river can get even bitches get hit
ima walk a dog on all fours embark em with long claws
just fight for the wrong cause your boss with thong drawers
you aint in my racket bitch followin faggots wit wanksta tats on their ass
eminem magic stick if i get hit once you get hit twice  backwards 

these thugs need to do what he love and just play the back
before ill put a sword on ya head like a raider cap

now what you gonna say to that

[ chorus ] [ eminem]

[ verse 3 ] [ bizarre ]

[ verse 4 ] [ kuniva ]

im calm but i steal on niggaz like i was clepto

why stop niggaz why not pop niggaz we cop figures

or get them guns on ya chest like a welcome to the hood t-shirt
lets go back before throw backs before i dro sacks
i used to blow gats bulletsll find you like a low jack
im hopeless a ferocious dosage of dope shit
a culprit of culture a chaotic comotion
kuniva will blow shit off the map i post it

[ chorus ] [ eminem ]

[ verse 5 ] [ kon artis ]

i point my fingers to the ground throw my waist to left of me
to knuckle should ship like a em upside down and you best be
on your ps and qs people we sees to use
no one sees your views so now you sees exclusives
and put it in your little magazine but you should
know that was the most desperate thing that you could
pull out of your crotch you faggots all owe us much
start doing herion lines for as much as you gossip
like bitches with oscars yall actresses
45s make bodies flip like flabby tits
bullets coming at your doom like a buck up 6th
now what the f**k you gonna do to get up out of this shit
your record was released 17 years ago you dumb bitch
do the math youll never have a shady / aftermath ring
and that kind of staff to back that ass up so back that ass up
before we clap that ass up
