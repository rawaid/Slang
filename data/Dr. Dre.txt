im stranded on death row for pumpin slugs in muthafuckers
now you know your outdone
feel the shotgun kurupt inmate cell block one

verse 2 rbx
no prevention from this mention of sorts
your a victim from my driveby of thoughts
no extensions all attempts are to fail
blinded by the light its time you learn braile
from the lunatic i death like arsenic
when i kick up wicked raps
dr dre will kick the scratch
with treachery my literary form will blast
&amp; totally surpass the norm
not a storm plural make it many storms
when im vexed i fly leg necks &amp; arms
in this dimension im the presenter
&amp; the inventor &amp; the tormentor
deranged like the hillside strangler
mc mangler tough like wrangler
i write a rhyme hard as concrete
step to the heat &amp; get burned like mesquite
so what you wanna do

verse 3 rage

there once was this girl i knew named bridgette
she asked me was my dick a grown man or a midget
of course i had to show her all my balls ring ding a ling
i whipped out my whopper but we wasnt at burger king
nothing more said she grabbed it like a vice grip
and asked the doc do you mind if i nibble this
no i took her to the back of the studio
and she ate up on the doc like a cheerio
i told the bitch yo please dont bite me
then she made me scream when she grabbed the balls tightly
so i slapped the bitch for goin out like a sucker
my dick was in her mouth so she bit the mother fucker
to make her stop i pulled up on her extentions
and i left jimmy standing at attention
the look on my eyes told the bitch she was a goner
now i look back on the day i should have peed on her

-chorus-
bridgette was a girl that i knew but
 bridgette was a dumb ho bridgette was a dumb ho
bridgette was  a girl that i screwed but
bridgette was a dumb ho bridgette was a dumb ho

so you know bridgette called me the next day
just to apologize so i said ok
she claims she wants to make it up to the doc
and you know im still out to get the pussy
tried to be nice cuz i didnt wanna diss her
passed mickie dees and went to the sizzler
ordered the food she started rubbin my knee
then i could tell that she wanted to fuck me
she said lets skip dinner and i had a fit
at ten dollars a plate i said fuck that shit
thats the whole reason our relationship was stormy
why cuz bridgette was too fuckin horny
she said please excuse me for a minute
to powder my nose i said ya im with it
she took a long time the food came and im chewin
thinkin to myself what the fuck is she doin
went to look for her and i heard alot of screamin
looked in a room and the waiters were teamin
up on the bitch like it aint no thang
but i flipped cuz it was bridgette gettin gang-banged

-chorus-
bridgette was a girl that i knew but
 bridgette was a dumb ho bridgette was a dumb ho
bridgette was  a girl that i screwed but
bridgette was a dumb ho bridgette was a dumb ho
yo dre you would have screwed the bitch too cuz
bridgette was a dumb ho bridgette was a dumb ho
bridgette id wear a rubber if i were you cuz yo
bridgette was a dumb ho bridgette was a dumb ho

so you know bridgette called me the next day
just to apologize so i said ok
she says she wants to come over and see me
and do any thing to fuck the doc
she said she loves me but i didnt say i love her
went to the store and bought me some rubbers
then i made a phone call up to the guys
boy this bitch is in for a big suprise
when she came in i put on a stone record

silent and calm and blackout when the beef is on
focus on your rap holsters notice
im evil like the exorcist to the locusts
ferocious thoughts are mergin at night
like jehovah towards the virgin in white
im wrapped in a turban for spite
like a israelite snatchin hoes up my flows up
when the f**kin world blows up throw your hands up

thinking of the easiest way to get a bank roll
knowledge is urban-able exhaust manifold
a tar can of hos to lubricate my system quick
shaky bitches off the dick
cos she got a vice grip on the flow from my lips
im slow but equipped with the proper tools
show me the one talkin shit so i can drop a fool
im out to glow a nigga roll if he think he mr cream
come back on the scene and smoke a phillie g
i really dream of gettin mine now let me tell you whats silly

i heard a gun bustin shots shots down the block block
i guess a nigga gettin what he got got
shit is heavy like a medicine ball and broke niggas to smoke niggas
ill fuck one for yall they made ya last phone call

and im cooler than foes that dont know how it goes

but you was wrong didnt know about the big long
head-strong nicknamed dav from off the school yard
witta teenage group im turnin loots to tracks
me and my niggas like these tracks are laced with bomb weed and tight
lyrics
you wanna know what the hos used to do
when me and my crew came bustin through
all sorts of blushins brew
a neighbourhood find a gift too swift miscellane is the crew
underground till my brown eyed balls turned blue
this is for the bitches and niggas that wanna front
i smoke on i broke on till i spoke on
miscellane packin shows like farrakhan
where is on another level with two niggas thats on the same plateau
now thats three times your tightest flow
and three times ya tightest track three times your fattest sack
three times is clever buck

begging me for another try

dry your eyes dont be feeling bluw
cause i know you never thought id be the one dogging you

chorus 2 x2

verse 3
theres no second chance
when i ask you to dance
theres no second chance
when you play with romance
youre a victim of your own circumstance
theres no second chance
theres no second chance
when i ask you to dance
theres no second chance
when you play with romance
youre a victim of your own circumstance
theres no second chance

but in this era of mayhem
i recyc the murderous rhymes to slay them
to all my opponents who wanna kick it i spark

standin my arms crossed toss a grenade
rein-force my zone as a lyrical barricade

becomin ogs in the game and changin
to make way for these new names and faces but
the strangest things can happen from rappin
when niggaz get wrapped up in image and actin
niggaz get capped up and wrapped in plastic
and zipped up in bags when it happens thats it
ive seen em come ive watched em go
watched em rise witnessed it and watched them blow
watched em all blossom and watched em grow
watched the lawsuits when they lost the dough
best friends and money i lost them both
went and visisted niggaz in the hospital
its all the same shit all across the globe
i just sit back and watch the show the watcher

everywhere that i go
aint the same as befo the watcher
people i used to know

but everywhere that i go

i moved out of the hood for good - you blame me
niggaz aim angry at niggaz they cant be
but niggaz cant hit niggaz they cant see
im out of sight now im out of they dang reach
how would you feel if niggaz wanted you killed
youd probably move to a new house on a new hill
and choose a new spot if niggaz wanted you shot
i aint a thug - how much tupac in you you got
i aint no bitch neither
its either my life or yo life and i aint leavin - i like breathin
cause nigga we can go round for round

but everywhere that i go

so i suggest you lay low the watcher

things just aint the same for gangstas
cops is anxious to put niggaz in handcuffs
they wanna hang us see us dead or enslave us
keep us trapped in the same place we raised in
then they wonder why we act so outrageous
run around stressed out and pull out gauges
cause everytime you let the animal out cages
its dangerous to people who look like strangers
but now we got a new era of gangsters
hustlers and youngsters livin amongst us
lookin at us now callin us bustaz
cant help but reminisce back when it was us
nigga we started this gangsta shit

snobby ass bitches get slapped out of spite
aight  so give a nigga some ackrite right

[hittman]
uhhhhh drink kickin in im stimulated
for those that dont know big words im fuckin faded
83 degrees ease to a shaded spot
our first spot was cool til some gangstas made it hot

plus we watchin hoes with lots of flesh exposed
gettin swarmed by those type of niggas
with no game but brown nose
so i impose only like pros can
yo is this your man  no
grab the bitchs hand im hittman
bling gold chain gleam
your very eligible for my summer league team
maybe too extreme cause the sister got steamed

stefan tattooed on her arm
hoe you aint the bomb must be a dyke
witcho lips swoll &amp; give a nigga some ackrite

chorus minus the word aight both times
blunt in my left hand drink in my right
strap by my waistline cause niggas dont fight
sucker free for life so you better think twice
nd give a nigga some ackrite

snatchin up your honey for some late night hype
snobby ass bitches get slapped out of spite
so give a nigga some ackrite

[hittman]
frontin on ack-rite causin me to act up
good samaritan save that hoe from gettin slapped up
my homies crack up at the scene i made
yo my actions aint serene when a niggas on fade
if it wasnt for the 1 time brigade
i wouldve sprayed at the hooker tramp
as cops parade im afraid its time to break camp
make tracks where else can we go to take hoes
from fake macks {*car horn*} aiyyo chase them girls
in that black maxima the passenger almost fractured her
neckbone lookin back at us
plus they on the dick cause the cap is hush
they blush i bumrush the hush with the largest crush
try to swing an ep tonight so i dont have to keep in touch
keep it on hush without the tippin
mackin interrupted by some niggas set trippin
clip in the strap i showed these niggas how to act
silenced gun sound

chorus

verse one dr dre
everyday its the same thang la aint changed
niggaz still playa hatin but dre aint changed
im just a lot smarter now
cause these niggaz is bangin ten times harder now
niggaz ringin they ass up in the wrong part of town
better turn they car around
rollin the window down eminem hey can we talk it out
hitt nah get the fuck out
johnny got a shotgun
and he aint even strong enough to cock one
fuck tryin to job hunt
niggaz got aks niggaz is way crazier
than dre was back in his nwa days
niggaz spray strays and shoot without lookin
niggaz walk by and blast without leavin a footprint
i think the attitudes are twice as worst
it takes half the time to get your life reversed
always tryin to play rambo with they ammo
make a nigga wanna stay in family mode
bang bang bang bang

chorus

second verse knoc-turnal
late nights is full of led that whistles as it goes by
murder arrives anytime
bullets take flight when the fo-five ignites
some hearts skip a beat some get blew out and every light
put you in the site of youngsters with automatics
bustin on shit to lay everything down even tourists and non-affiliates
these days gun play is official with green lights on every block
know the sign tells you too its not best to stop
on every corner cali niggaz are dumpin
youll be shakin your soul loose from the box at the coroners
makin death not so foreign to ya
niggaz got rugers and m-14s with enough
ammo to leave an armored truck swiss cheese
ive learned to stay away from house parties
ive seen too many go and end up absent without leavin
aint no warm welcomings my eyes have witnessed the bend in on
nights that dont sleep and fireworks until dawn

chorus

third verse hittman
now tell me - what the fuck is this man
niggaz doin brothers in worse than the klan
cant even stand in front of your buildin and chill
without yieldin twelve-year-old children that kill
blood spillin thugs be illin unnecessary slugs
fillin the sky usually drillin the one
that wasnt willin to die yes sir in the killing field
i got my life preserver
and ill do my time for murder these niggaz got the nerve to
question me - bout the colors that i got on
now see that red dot on your knot
bout to get your whole crew shot on
a soldier of fortune im the wrong nigga to plot on
took him out on the spot before he even got on
my hitlist -- peep this
i cock back you bow down
bust round bloody the ground retaliation sounds like this

everywhere i go all i ever seem to hear is
bang bang bang bang
no matter where i go all i ever seem to see is
bang bang bang bang
everywhere i go all i ever seem to hear is
bang bang bang bang
no matter where i go all i ever seem to see is
bang bang bang bang
everywhere i go all i ever seem to hear is
bang bang bang bang
no matter where i go all i ever seem to see is
bang bang bang bang
everywhere i go all i ever seem to hear is
bang bang bang bang
no matter where i go all i ever seem to see is

this one is for my brother tyree rip
a message to god

[dr dre]
since you finishin him early what possessed you to start him
we made a vow later well regret til death do us part
lord i thought we was made for each other
you shouldnt connect those made to be taken away from each other
now what im supposed to do im only half the man that i was
ill never last cause my better half is up there wit you
you knew what you was doin when you made us; so with all due respect
you couldve forgave him you didnt have to take him
he can take the game with him cause he defines the word
the one who puts the g in it who you think put me in it
im feelin like my whole world is blinded
wonderin why im cryin pourin out my heart pourin out liquor behind it
we fought like brothers somethin we never should do
we couldve used time spent arguin tellin the truth
he had talent too i had plans on watchin him blow
dont know what hurts more seein him leave or watchin him go
