chorus
you need to4xoperatin under the crooked american system too long
outkast pronounced out cast
adjective meaning homeless or unaccepted in society
but lets look deeper than that
are you an outkast
if you understand and feel the basic principles and
fundamental truths contained within this muzik you probably are
if you think its all about pimpin hoes and slammin cadillac dos
you probably a cracker or a nigga that think he a cracker
or maybe just dont understand
an outkast is someone who is not considered to be part of the normal world
he is looked at differently
he is not accepted because of his clothes his hair
his occupation his beliefs or his skin color
now look at yourself are you an outkast i know i am
as a matter of fact fuck being anything else
its only so much time left in this crazy world
wake up niggaz and realize whats goin on around you
poisonin of the food and water
tamperin of ciggarettes
disease engineering control over your life
take back your existance or die like a punk
this is big rube sayin right on to the real and death to the fakers

once upon a time not long ago
when the playa from the pointe didnt have no doe
a nigga hit me for my tennis shoes walkin to the sto
caught a nigga slippin but now i lay it to the flo

just like carpet cause i got the heat in my rhythm
momma nay not never braggin just to stay knot
even when i was a younger lad i learned my lesson
never talked to strangers in the trap and answered questions

the pope and his folks got us under a scope
but for unknown reasons cuz we dont sell dope
that you distribute we dont contribute to your clandestine
activity my soliloquoy may be hard for some to swallow
but so is cod liver oil
you went behind my back like bluto when he cut up olive oyl
two things i hate lies and thieves they make my blood boil
boa constricted on my soul that they call

chorus andre

touched by the wheelz of steel
now show me how you feel
touched by the wheelz of steel

verse two big boi andre

gotta collect call they done locked up my folks
low blow hit me in the left ventricle
we wont be able to ride out till two thousand fo

but not for long cuz we got a better sack to serve
tryin to take you other people for your rims at the curb
fore you swerve and bust ya forehead go head go head
more head for me while you ride to the beat

drop like tears like for fears you know
shout shout let it all out just for my peers
and pupils who feel like its time to unwind
like december 31st on nineteen-ninety-nine

hunchin with all our clothes on
until we felt excited then aaaah

and i see you on the next song
they call it horny
because its devilish
now see we dead wrong

chorus

people dont know the stress im dealing with day to day
speakin about the feeling im possessing for rene
mopin around and wondering where she stay
saw her last that she lay
give it another day i say
but the lord he taketh away
now give it back lawd
cause thats like backboards without the rims
me and my auntie was tight like southwest
before the pinks moved in
like the niggas that owned the ligour store
crack cocaine pimps and whores
livin up on this earth
before a nigga like daddy was born
but they makin a scene
that my music and crime are a team
but im speakin the truth not dreams
so what in the fuck they mean
my lyrics aint clean

chorusverse one big boi

in the zone like keyser soze always the usual suspect
no check all i got in this game is my respect
and southern pride i be checkin my fuckin head
scared lookin up in your face boi i see dead
if you test like sat then i guess that we may be enemies
in the ps freestyles be freebies
i be that wrong nigga to fuck with wouldnt i
wouldnt i be the wrong one to try never eating chicken thighs
only the twenty piece mojo flow zone like flo jo
i wanted to figure out just how low could yo hoe go
the beat hit like beat street krush groove and breakin
never bakin rebukin satan we had you waitin
for the second coming funny how time flies when youre rhymin
la-fa-ce records i think they got that perfect timin
to be doper than sadaam believe the nation of islam
fuck the police and the dogs sniffin that dope up out your car
i think they overstep they boundaries
oj not guilty thats how they found he

verse two andre

i felt the pressure like sun shinin while raining at the same time
i kept on rhymin not complainin
storm bringing cats and dogs my catalog be the size of golf balls
throw up your daisy dukes im hazzard-ous to all you boss hoggs
and roscoe p col people who could boost my locomotive
but enough of that everyone can rap unless they aint supposed ta
i use my gift of gab to boast and brag in every rhyme i
compose wont yall get sick of that cause i know i do when i hear those
flows that aint hip-hop you find that shit in the gift shop
but to each his own my speech is gon keep that shit up outta my zone
long as you happy then im happy
even if you just hate my fuckin guts go head and dap me
cause im gon dap you anyway and then go home and pray for yo ass later
cause we might need you in this war im wailin on you traitors
like thatverse 1

revolutionary scary
thought provokin spoken
words of a chain i dont feel but i see
visions from me at twenty three

making us free in my community one day is what i live for
aint thinking about no hope no more
i got my boots i kick it till i get with

adapt and overcome oh hum hum
go get my gun load up for fun and put down with the frown
what goes round comes round from mlk to cascade
i know its through them plenty figures
cocaine dealers walk the wrong side
up in they rides
looking cleaner then i seen them the last time
then selling dimes now its quarter keys stacking gs
in the south indies
my nigga them folks riding bicycles among vehicles
off in the hood
knowing each and every nigger sellin but can you blame 
the fact the only way a brother can survive the game
the block hard to get by the dope dealing fatal killings
in fair times so writing rhymes
it aint just the police
we kill each other just lost another brother
fast living will get you took
thinking it cant happen to you and then it do 
off crooked schemes its just a drea
floating face down in the mainstream

think it is when it aint all peaches and cream
thats why some are found floating face down in the main stream

they swan divin
fit they name be thrashing an album
go-kart rushin to finish their album then you find them
lost dog paddling back stroking what done happened
be rhymin catching the day when the recipe calls for black and
wrong ingredients
maybe too much herbs and spices
maybe you got hungry for the wrong dish 
southern greens and this entice them how them joke the same
so im gonna sing just like them to get where they at
ill even break my by back to touch their rim if i gotta
my alta mater be that i follow
i bite whatever thats looking tasty water it down then swallow
i hope you vomit wont call no names cause thats not my job
it just applies to whom it may concern you know who you are
but if you dont you never will you just receive the steel
but then it might get ugly cause trust me niggas do feel
the way that i felt when i wrote this but we must stay in focus
we kings and queens up in this thing get rid of all them jokers
face down face down face down

think it is when it aint all peaches and cream
thats why some are found floating face down in the main stream

i let you stay in my crib now you know where i live
when you was hungry fed you a hot meal look at the hand you deal
me crudball business giving niggas inches so here take a foot
luck only counts in rabbits feet and horseshoes
experience is sometimes the best teacher until we get our own plate
i hope you dont mind me eating off of yours
process momma moping like jerry
meanwhile fairies of the street sprinkling pixie dust over greenery
never to obtain another level of con-science
only to test to poke and see
why laying here they scheme over one another mouth to feed
 with a decision to make now words shape your destiny
but a missle will take it all the way just as quick as you can say
i wish i never did what i did now face this biz
it was the company you kept the many places you slept
when you shouldnt have geekin like a rat jumping like a trap
contributing to sin and your nigga bitch in the club showin pink for ten
they got you niggas where they want you again
floating face down in the mainstream
thats why thats why thats why

think it is when it aint all peaches and cream
thats why some are found floating face down in the main stream

verse 4

everybodys a player rubbin them kangols on their head
thinking its all about your clothes nigger its all about your self
the way you feel about your life the times that you done shared with
your friends and family up and down like hoes give head
to dicks oh six serving them in the mix but aint no mystery
you know the history about this clique bitch
oh what you dont want me to call you slut
then why you fucking all them niggers letting them all up in your guts
but see that aids im afraid thats why i play the quiet role
i lay in the cut every month thinking ill let that fire roll
like chimneys and smoke signals maybe peace pipes even
my partners call me big boi and my first name is not steven
in the mainstream home team banging them with these hits
in the mix flowing like some motherfucking swordfish

think it is when it aint all peaches and cream
thats why some are found floating face down in the main stream
think it is when it aint all peaches and cream
thats why some are found floating face down in the main stream
think it is when it aint all peaches and cream
thats why some are found floating face down in the main stream

ready to go at any moment jumpin like a pogo stick
i never lived up to my expectations so i accept the patience

back and forth inside im melting like water on wicked bitches
a monster truck done came and ran over my picket fences
i had the best of life in my clinches but monkey wrenches was thrown
like chairs kings sit on my prayers seem to long
i fall asleep before the endin dont even get to say amen
i hope he understand i be on bended knees
at times i think im crazy so i say forget it

only cultivate the stable dirt when i skeet my drops

conceive true deception and multiply it a million fold
visualize the yin and yang in a battle so intense that we get em confused

we wanna be at a presidential level what are we doin
foolin ourself clownin ourself playin ourself but not bein ourself
we cant babble no more than we can bob our head offbeat
nimrod by the time we forty cause we cant get our meat
while we ask no reason for the misplacement of the season
look at the picture thats painted
tainted as the mind whos blinded to the point where sodomites get all the rights
we fall for fights with fisticuffs get pissed enough to miss the bus
it disgusts me to see my folks run up on
i say stand up on the section of time marked revelations
and recognize this mind numbin reality of horror known as mankind
jesus and his twelve disciples make thirteen a righteous number of righteous men
even judas the betrayer came true in the end
the devil say the end is the beginnin
they teach that we were the product of incest
invest no level of self into their system of paganomics
stand with us and dont look back upon

niggaz hang around cause of who you are
you get a lot of love cause of what you got
say they happy for you but they really not

sell a lot of records and you roll a benz
swoll up in the spot now you losin friends
all you wanna do is give the world your heart
record label tried to make you compromise your art

you make a million dollars make a million mo
first class broad treat you like a nigga po
you wanna say wait but youre scared to ask
as your world starts spinning and its moving fast

tryin to stay sane is the price of fame
spending your life trying to numb the pain
you shake that load off and sing your song
liberate the minds then you go on home

i must admit they planted a lot of things
in the brains and the veins of my strain
makes it hard to refrain from the host of cocaine
from them whores from the flame
from a post in the game
makes it hard to maintain focus

theyre from the glock rounds and lockdowns and berries
the seeds that sow get devoured by the same locusts
cause its a hard row to hoe
if your ass dont move and the rain dont fall
and the ground just dry
but the roots are strong so some survive
so youre surprised now im bustin cries

you got more juice than zeus
slangin lightning tryin to frighten
plains dwellers of the serengeti
but get beheaded when you falsely dreaded
melanin silicon and collagen injected
dissectin my pride fool i dont wanna get it started
we be the lion-hearted without a fantasy
its like that red sprite you cant imagine it

unless you lookin at the canvas of life
and not through the peephole of mortality
single minded mentality
gettin over on loopholes
gettin paid two-fold on technicalities
clickin your heels scared to voice how you feel
pack the steel

pickin cotton from the killing fields with no toe
i dont we in kansas no mo though
midwest or dirty south
clean dressed or dirty mouth
whether robbin preachers or killin poor righteous teachers

you a scared demon
shouldnt be allowed to spread semen
and your cowardly lies never defyin the jackals who babble
runnin with they pack tail between your legs
though the man on your head say the story
as you downplay your glory
cacklin helpin the shacklin of your brethern happen
just by rappin
libertadyo this is my story this is my song
and to them rudypoots dont attempt to try this at home
its just a poem until yall learn right from wrong

i made her shit her drawers
she said she thought hip hop was only guns and alcohol
i said oh hell naw but yet its that too
you cant discrimahate cause you done read a book or 2
what if i looked at you in a microscope saw all the dirty organisms
living in your closet would i stop and would i pause it whoo
to put that bitch in slower motion got the potion and the antidote
and a quote for collision the decision
is do you want to live or wanna exist
the game changes everyday so obsolete is the fist and marches
speeches only reaches those who already know about it
this is how we go about it

chorus

erykah badu
im wild just like a rock a stone a tree
and im free just like the wind the breeze that blows
and i flow just like a brook a stream the rain
and i fly just like a bird up in the sky
and ill surely die just like a flower plucked
and dragged away and thrown away
and then 1 day it turns to clay
it blows away it finds a ray it finds its way
and there it lays until the rain and sun
then i breathe just like the wind the breeze that blows
and i grow just like a baby breastfeeding
and its beautiful thats life and thats life
and thats life and thats life

*big boi*
five thousand one hundred ten days
is a short period of time a mere fourteen years
on this precious mother earth you see tisha had issues
and her decision making skills were still in its early stages
you know what im talking about 
therefore she could not properly handle a blessing in which 
she thought to be an obstacle in her path to adulthood
pause just like a brother with a thousand pauses
should i shouldnt i i cant i have to mama will never see me the same
daddy and big mama i know all of them gonna be ashamed of me
are just a few thoughts racing through her cranium
as she sits on top of the pale cold porcelain seat in the rear of the house
the unthinkable moments away from becoming reality sadly with no clue
and no way of expressing her feeling to her mam or anybody else in her life
tisha done came to the crossroads and now she got to choose
fatality fatality fatality fatalityhook slum beautiful driving i plum crazy
slum beautiful soul but so amazing

[andre 3000]
they dont know but i do though
baby my darling you make me loose composure
fragments of a million me
scattered across the floor to a certain degree
where i had to give your mama call
and thank her for spending time with your daddy
for all its worth girl whats your frequency
and can i come there frequently

hook

[big boi]
what i like to do most is spit this game like sports announcers
and will pity pat them hoez down like a gentlemen club bouncer
ounce of killa dilla be making my game more flagrant
and once i done had some cuervo bout six shots im nothin to play wit

maybe lady luscious oba kaybee so they say thee
an old school playa pimp type ass nigga like tony mercedes
and will work every last muscle off in your body like billy blanky
hanky panky where did you get your gold grill cause its banging
and i like then redhot fila straight from walters off the chain
fuck them bouige bitches they dont know nothin bout you

chorus 

big rube 
my fingertips scan flesh so supple 
no longer a couple like two in one skin 
where do you end and where do i begin 
both brains become one mind sensually 
every nerve becoming its own individual entity 
with its own lusts its own needs to serve 
longing for the love of all the other nevers 
as they writhe and twist in satisfaction 
in the burning chill of please we bathe 
engulfing encompassing like a cataclysmic shockwave 
of an impact so deep but not one of destruction 
but of creation elation in the re-making 
no taking in the relation no taking in the relation 
just giving of ther persona making lover after making love 
till aint nothing but stankonia

never trying to be nothing better than you are being
one nation under the cool should be the rule
when a young man or a young lady begins or starts grade school
silence before violence nine times out of ten times
the quietest is the livest fumbling through your privates
daddy fat sax can i have you back naw
ooh you such a player ooh your southern drawl
got me sprawled out in your black book my name was crossed out
went from starting second string now you in the dog house

instead of arguments you think about the hugs and kisses
if this is something hard for you to take
you better bounce rock roller skate

[hook] might as well have fun cause your happiness is done and your goose is cooked [4x]

[verse 1] first rule in this thang never let em see you sweat
never let em be a threat and your feelings you must protect em
as well as your rectum must keep self out of harm out of dangers way
let strangers play while you graduate and move on
true happiness is not acquired and you wont find it for sale
unless youre in jail and trying to get a bail bondsman to go on and post that bail
you would be happy as hell you thought you was happy until that court date came
couldnt abort that case nobody to take your place
family home at stake too late to escape and get on the run

[hook]

[verse 2] one upon a rhyme one time when i was a child flip that smile upside down now
when i found out that santa claus was nothing more than vanilli
it was silly cause my mom and pop they worked for every penny
didnt have many but had enought to get by enough to get fly
only to start on new year off in debt now you forget
your happiness came and went
like mom and dads realationship take a trip
you got the potato chips ill bring the hot sauce

[hook]

[verse 3] 1979 dirty south local lounge flip that smile upside down now
i never thought that alcohol could ease the notion of the sadness
now what used to be a happy home done turned into some bad shit
graphic language mild violence and the silence of the fams
no members to remember but i know just who i am
ive grown into a man and like my nigga said we executed the game plan
cause we got that hot sauce

[hook]girl you cut up oww

my daughter my baby my baby mama all escapin me
in the wind she was my friend
like princess di before she died
therefore we tried and tried again
but in the end you pay attention to the pluses
but the minuses behind make it seem like you cant win

luther vandross couldnt make a home out of this house that we smooshed
smashed pushed to the limit smash and turned it timid
hell everyone was sufferin the house was feelin wicked
the cat got sold the dog got old the food got cold
both of our tempers were on swolle
for the most part you fuss fight fart
you build it up to break it down and now take it from the start
repeatedly leadin a path that only ends in a clash
of two stubborn minds grown folks blind to the sign

some of the coolest individuals on the planet we said
best believe that we can buck or give a damn if we cared
no collision supervision but my family is here
now my mama taught my niggaz that was under the stairs
one of those who chauffeured life and then was unprepared
but my hunger is the thought that no wonder it cant be smothered
or buttered up buttercup melt your sauce
you a chucky cheese bouncer chumpin off the boss
what im trying to tell you now is that youre softer that soft
and im sick as a cough did i mention its raw
your predicaments flaw
flaw means fucked up and serving out the oven not fried slow roast

my old earth even known to handle biz
i serve whipped out of whips whip out cash
usually keep a g packed under the dash
try to test my gangsta i bring harm
im as slick as freeway rick and nicholas barnes
my uptown nikes hold caps and cheddar
my waistline hold a 4-pound baretta
ill shoe lace your face just to learn you better
my ox so sharp it cut through leather
my rap name killer my street name skunk
i mastered the music that was born in the bronx
i switch my slang spit from my mouth
im still all coast my coast the south

[hook]get the fuck up off me nigga

[verse 1]
as i struggle to keep my balance and composure
im posed to propose a toast to the players on every coast of
the lyrical rollercoaster mind bender
stead of watching these sucker emcees
im seeing just how theyre lyin to the general population
dont be patient get up and stand up for your life
do you agree or understand that we lost some rights since 1-1-9
come dumb come young come blind
unwind confined to the situation we facin cause its time
tic tic boom

verse 2
when will we all awake up out of this dream
come here and smell the folgers the soldiers
the human beings man acting as if he was the supreme being
clocking the souls of men out like he was god and war
there will be no tomorrow but sorrow and horror will follow
the hollow hearts battle for dollars
politicians modern day magicians physicians of death
more health care for poor health who makin us ill
they making us kill its makin me spill my guts
chill big lay in the cut for what i refuse to sit in the backseat and get handled
like i do nothing all day but sit around and watch the cartoon channel
ill rap about the presidential election and the scandal that followed
and we all watched the nation as it swallowed and chalked it up
basically america you got fucked -- the media shucked and jived now we stuck

verse 3
operation anaconda ask yourself was it full of bleeps and blunders
did they ever find osama and why in the fuck did daniel pearl have to pay
the price for his life and his wife plead twice
see al-amin got life and fred got dead hampton
to dampen the dream of the panthers they got the answer
for ransom as we breathe together as we dream together
count your blessings whenever you feel that things wont be no better but it got to
he gave me this microphone so i must rock your brain waves
airwaves energize and shock you -- yall got me
well i got yall long as i know you listening
im gon always bring food for thought to the table in the kitchen
now eat niggaman have you ever really wondered
like why are we here  what the meanin to all of this

[chorus big boi]
sometimes life can keep you down with your face all in the dirt
hall-le-lu-jah

[verse one big boi]
big slide into the mode time to drop a load
my life is goin downhill like some cardboard in the snow
my bank account is frozen i
dont think that i can get out this hole
feel like the figure four leglock
like the jury went away and then they came back deadlocked
i cant move i cant eat i cant even breathe
cant even buy a decent sack without the stems and the seeds
no trees no ps to ease the stress of everyday livin
but homeless people gotta suck it up wherever they livin
the unforgiven or the unwillin live a life of sinnin
and expect to be as pure as an infant in the beginnin

[interlude]
but what about repentance
what about the tension
what about you eating dinner in the devils kitchen
but what about repentance
what about committing the same sin
over and over again and again and ah

[hook - singers]
why are we here  huh  huh  huh
please tell me - what are we here foooooooorrrrrrrrrr ow

[verse two big boi]
life is nothin but a dream so peaceful and serene
unless youre bein evil then you on the devils team
well i receive what you want to believe
but soon youll have to sow those bad seeds
please any man can ask to get a pass
or a cleansing of sin to grant another chance
perhaps another glance of the light at the end of the tunnel
talk to the coach or break out the huddle
whatever should you fumble your rebuttal should be subtle
cause he who lives in the upper room is never gullible
as you survey the syllables and sentences
the question that im merely trying to pose is as simple as me saying

[interlude]
but what about repentance
what about the tension
what about you eating dinner in the devils kitchen
but what about repentance
what about committing the same sin
over and over again and again and ah

[chorus] minus hall-le-lu-jah singers
sometimes life can keep you down with your face all in the dirt
now if you feel that left behind need to get up and go to church

verse 1
well heres a formal introduction
something to make you ponder
the situations ugly like in living colors wanda word up
well everybody play dumb but theres some that succumb
and fall victim i will overcome any hurdle or obstacle thats in my path
fast cash should be the last resort so make it last for the risk you took
trick u shook your ass for some hundred dollar heels and a designer bag
now thats ass backwards
all you got in the refrigerator is bratwurst
your stomach is balled in a knot you got that phat purse 
pocketbook stop and look pockets look void
destroyed by the need to indulge and enjoy the finer thing in life right
your dignity your only sacrifice slim as your chances of being somebodys wife
they seeing ya but  booty naked every  night aint  nothing right or wrong 
hook

verse 2
even though things started falling apart
wanda went and bought a honda
now shes out of a job she would slob on a knob
for a little less than a yard a massage you could drill her like a sarge
she would charge and rob
pick trough yo pockets
she got the tricks watch and the silver locket
that he bought for his wife but wanda left her license
on the night stand fuckin with this white man
she met in a little red corvette paid for sex
made a deal that she would never forget you can bet
every action has a positive and equal reaction
therefore everything that goes around comes around in that fashion
fast and furiously there was a knock on the sliding glass door bitch its me
you thought you was slick the way you hit me for that lick 
but you slipped now im getting in your shit

aint it funny how youre born and then your life begins
just like a baby all alone thats if you wasnt a twin
you must begin to fend for self when the umbilicals cut
the doctor put you under the heating lamp your spirit is touched
you know what i take that back why you was alive
date of conception interception cause the sperm did collide
from t n a to dna feelings turn to children
the morning after pill didnt put a halt to our very existance
we livin breathin soon well be teethin
our granny got a gold and now we want one for that reason
an adolescent mind is so impressionable in those stages
but parents got to parent their kids to keep them out of cages

i mean us left in the dust
try to catch up with massah
i used to wanna wrap my hands around the esophagus of them crackers
but ephesians 612 said it wasnt flesh and blood that we wrestle against
principalities powers of this world
rulers of darkness and spiritual wickedness
in high places so throw that whole armor of righteousness
i spark this thang but my name aint bubba
i got a problem with racist cab drivers like glover
and brothers that wax fat an dforget all about the struggle

but ill be bringing god to the gunfight
cant live forever so have some fun right
lifes a bowl of candy you can have one right
you can handle if tomorrow never comes right
youll get used to singin if only for one night
but i intend to raise two daughters and a son right
and i couldnt have wrote this if i was hopeless
and see i focus to provoke this
so open wide for my opinionated opus
stop playin go fish but not below this
before i go i thought that you all should know this
recognize and realize before any regretting
before you relapse perhaps youll consider resetting

the way you stare 
yeah im there you commited the crime
and i am the victim

[verse 2]
i got an eye out for she that cries out passionately
who do things backwardly forwardly horizontally
im too young to be settling down
quick to change my mind tomorrow
so now can i borrow your timid torso 
more so than your soul
and it just got to be how i roll
fuck the rhythm tuck the rhythm
under your bosom your the prism
shirley chisholm was the first
lets rehearse making a baby
put in your order
i wanna baby daughter
dance on the tip of my tongue
check the cloud until 
there is no more wetness in them
tell your homegirls that you will send them 
a postcard from 3000 hard

[chorus 2]
dont want to make you feel strange 
but dont let these word be in vain 
so spread - spread for me

i cram to understand why a woman and a man
make a plan to enter matrimony then he takes her hand
put that ring on her finger couple of kids in minivans
standin in the stands like a fan watch her little man
run ball
and every time you see the family they look happy
got her mama and her daddy and i think they got a lil dog
but daddy had her cat on the side
he would hide her from his ride decide not to divide
kept the yam in the hide the spouse in the house
boy its cheaper to keep her you fuck around and take a loss
come up short like short dog cuss words flow like
[too short sample] motherfucker shit goddamn asshole
took my shit [too short sample] beeitch fuck

lord please have mercy on my soul 
i have the impression that my life goin to be a bowl with cherries 
but its going to be very hard for me to cope 
tired of being broke 
this atlian aint got no time to sit and mope 
made up my mind while yall made up yo beds 
on a cold wooden floor is where i lie my head 
born in 1975 
never thought i would make it this far im still battilin this racial war 
tryin to find solutions of the situation i face 
the only thing that is free is my flow that yall be chasin 
lettin my niggas know before i go 
i drop that knowledge like dropping books 
lets stop the crooks from robbing you from your reins and such 
using wellfare as a cruch 
im in it for good 
you into my hood you wont be findin much 
hope that when im gone yall remember this 
what we stood for 
fuck that fame make that glits 
its begening to look a lot like the ending got to be more careful 
know what corners you be benden revalations is getting impatient 
now im dead 
remember what i said 
im gone 
bow yo headsall aboard
or are all yall bored
its good o have yall back now
ladies and gents
yall already know what it is
god dont make no mistakes
god dont make no mistakes

little do they know when i was brought up in this game
point aint always in a vibe for spitting i made a change
like the diaper on the bottom of my baby daughter
i wasnt ready to be no father maybe kind of sorta
cause when i saw her i swear it made a tear fall
not tears of sorrow but of joy so listen here yall
i grabbed the mic and moved the crowd then disappeared dog
back in 94 that was the motherfucking year homeboy
then that southernplayalistic went platinum
stacks on deck they aint tell us to pay our taxes
walking around the table in the kitchen just for practicing
reciting rhymes to sharpern minds now lets deliver to the masses

been a good long road
now its time for me to go
i say goodbye goodbye goodbye
time to spread my wings
so high up in the sky
i can fly i fly i fly so high

welcome to my life i think its time i take it back
i got to give you all the facts so you can see what type of cat
that you dealing with now on atliens we was killing it
and then my auntie pass she was like my mother i was feeling it
the first person close to me to die i needed healing
but i see her as an angel when i look up at the ceiling
like my daddy and grandaddy on both shoulders steady chilling
so you got to keep on living like each day is the beginning
its yo birthday even on your worst day
live it like the first day im antwan andre
or general patton if you know bout purple ribbon or got purp
i i be on that kryptonite that means i cant be hurt

gotta leave this place its been cool but i got to go

been a good long road
now its time for me to go
i say goodbye goodbye goodbye
time to spread my wings
so high up in the sky

even on the train
shouldve asked two per men

from the caboose

and now its time to say goodbye they shouldve turned me loose
i was all about my team but now i call upon my crew
im a family type of person but im deadly dolo too
and you can achieve anything that you put your heart into
see the second hand will never stop and neither will the clock
the nigga big still hit the stage by hisself and still rock
when your faith is in the right place see he aint gon let you flop
you can say whatever you want bet you cant do it like me boy stop

before you can say you cant at all
theres no excuse this time dont be afraid to fly
you never know what day the doors will close
its time to say goodbye time to pack up and ride
got to leave this place its been cool but i gotta go

been a good long road
now its time for me to go
i say goodbye goodbye goodbye
time to spread my wings
so high up in the sky

[big boi]
oh baby its mo baby its workin on the 6

after exchanging of the rings these things you give me lip
but not the kissing of the bride the dipping of the groom
the shit that make a nigga up and leave up out a room
more like boohoo then boo fuck you and fuck you too
fuckin bitch kids cover them ears
it appears that ya mama want drama we need a comma
or some space between words for better or for worse
this is not what i deserve the worse that i can take
