[intro excerpt from interview with dash snow]
ill tell you what i dont believe in can i do that
alright i dont believe in the in laws or the system by any means whatsoever
i try not to obey them at any time
thats what i believe in not believing in
so what keeps you alive
four big bottles of water a day two packs of marlboro reds and
uh what keeps me alive shit um
music i have to listen to music all day long
i say that keeps me going
im a pretty dark person ive thought about ending it a million times
and i have to say that music keeps me here by far the main thing

[kendrick lamar]
thank you
sitting in the studio thinking about which mood would go
right now freestyle or write down whatever
and still i come up clever i just need to free my thoughts
and lord knows that i know better but i aint perfect
i aint seen too many churches or know them testament verses
you should either hear me now or go deaf
or end up dead die trying and know death
might end up dead swallow blood swallow my breath
fuck a funeral just make sure you pay my music respect nigga
i mean that from the bottom of my heart
you see my art is all i have and victory tastes sweet
even when the enemy can throw salt
still knock em out the park like a fucking tow car
let bygones be bygones but where im from
we buy guns and more guns to give to the young
im living the life of a nigga trapped nigga
inside the system all you envision is trap niggas
my uncle doing life inside prison he wasnt wrapped too tight
he told me rap about life not rap niggas
thats why im shaking my head when you rap dissing
my stomach start turning my nerves get to twitching
i start evaluating then my final intuition
is that you wishing a come up would just come up
we used to beefing over turf fuck beefing over a verse
niggas dying motherfuck a double entendre
and this is compton lions in the land of the triumph
wrap saran our defiance ban our alliance
put burners in the hands of the black man
one hood with twenty fo-fos like a cloned kobe bryant
you probably heard i wanna be heard and wonder who i am
you probably even listen to faith and think i know zion
but really im just caught in the loop of understanding the truth
because it seem like its always clashing with science
i got a big fear of flying
my future so bright id probably go blind before i blink twice i aint lying
i swear to god half of yall just dont know kendrick
the school of hard knocks we was the first ones in attendance
you walking down the block he got shot you wouldnt know i witnessed
you just mind your bidness
you just turn your head kneel down and then tie your tennises
its kinda scary aint it
you cant act like no bitch that only got tyler perry famous
just let me explain this why you pick up that stainless
cause your pops wasnt anxious to see you when you hated him
so much you probably had your burner tucked in graduation
said if you see him on them bleachers then you kill him facing
twenty-five to life with a murder charge
your enemies was the prey and now you pray to god
i pray these bars get farther than compton
and if my record never break i still wont break my promise i promise to keep it honest
secret society all we ask is trust
and all we lack is communication like service sucks
the people scared of annihilation when kingdom come
and im like the kendrick lamar od in less than a month
alright gotta keep it pushing
cant let the government tell me how my future looking
im on rosecrans &amp; central trying to duck the central bookings
if the fucking pigs get behind me then you know im bucking never will i surrender
ive been a warrior when i came out of my moms placenta
in the gutter lane like im master splinter
how splendid i guess my project had did it
got all these niggas approaching their mixtapes different
they said seven tracks i said fifteen
called it an ep they said im tripping
but little did they know im tryna change the rules
that weve been confined to so the corporate wont make decisions
uppity bitches handling bidness
killing our dreams stealing our vision
out in haiti adolescents barely have a home
in la everybody think they fucking on
hop on twitter perpetrate we doing big shit
who we hanging with and bragging about the iphone
i swear to god most yall cats just dont know kendrick
you barely know yourself so i guess most of yall should be offended
aint doing this for my health im just trying to purchase my momma them businesses
occupy my time with riches justify my time ambitions
just to coincide just to go inside books we idolize while we living
look the mastermind took the masters mind just the perfect time just to mastermind
just to master grind with precision look the mastermind took the [coughs]

[outro]
we would like to call this an appreciation tape
for those who recognized the kendrick lamar ep
for this is the kendrick lamar od
because of you we are overly dedicated[chorus jhene aiko]
where are we going why are we slowing down
where are you going we should be growing now

[kendrick lamar]
smoke to it nigga smoke to it nigga

[chorus]

[kendrick lamar]
thats what she said to me
that place i used to call home is just a bed to me
and we dont even sleep neighbors can hear her weep
meanwhile im in these streets with everybody
im trying to get it and she know they got me i watch her feelings watch me
as they staring with the saddest eyes of loneliness
look each other in the face and barely blink
i tried to make it right but the pen ran out of ink
so if my letters dont reach you i hope these lyrics in sync

[chorus]

[kendrick lamar]
thats what it said to me
but that place i call ambition now dead to me
gone and forgotten im off track like dale earnhardt
my liver rotten alcoholic tripping
fucking bad bitches and they got bad intentions
club night guys and dolls
balling out but im bout to drop the ball
im calling out for help my engineer called
told me come to the studio i wanna tell him nah

[chorus]

[kendrick lamar]
thats what he said to me
but that place we call heaven unfair to me
only a hundred and forty-four can go
seven billion people on planet earth today
is there something that i dont know
i know to follow him rather following people
or follow vanity cause that means im following evil
guess im following evil i should follow cathedral
blessings i need but live like i dont need you

[chorus]

[kendrick lamar]
so in conclusion
we all seem to stumble planning our own demise
forgetting the big picture and making it wallet size
so to whats important in my life i apologize
i promise to stay faithful focused and sanctified
we all get distracted
the question is would you bounce back or bounce backwards
would you not know how to act or take action its just a part of life
and if your visions impaired you probably lose it all tonight

[jhene aiko]
im trying to visualize how to get it right
but my visions so blurry
trying to slow it down stay close to the ground
but were always in a hurry now
and if i could make this world stand a little slower
then i would then we could grow a little closer
i think were getting closer
i think were getting closeri remember uh
all my uncles sir smokers
on the landra in front of our building
they was my heroes

[chorus]
this shit is so dope you might wanna be my crackhead
this shit is so dope you might wanna be my crackhead
bad bitches crackheads street niggas crackheads
this shit is so dope you might wanna be my crackhead

uh and thats scary to me
dope beat dope flow vary to me
especially when sounwave is on his ps
nigga cue me in im a peruvian drug lord
dont fast forward ima serve you some +keys+
this is crack cocaine im kurt cobain
and i bang like a c-r-i-p
p-r-i-u high you im an i-v
this shit is so dope you might wanna be my crack stop
i said an i-v cause when i be
in the studio high shot a needle in your vein
take it in vain or itch till your eyeballs pop
im cold on the cold turkey i hate chickens
but i do fuck pretty birdies where your girl at
over the pyrex where my world at

[chorus]

uh and thats scary to me
every listener is a strawberry to me
you pussies aint shit but venereal disease
disease on k-dot uh uh better wake up
a nightmare im right there like a siamese
twin when you motherfuckers gon learn
curl up like big worm when i drop
who fly im a red eye with eyedrops
i big i pac you chris i +rock+
thats pookie hom new jack head-first with a cyclops
im the first one to do that i bet you never knew that
back like a tailbone who you got to tell on
if it aint about me about hoe
or be about face if you aint no higher learn it
theres soda in the pot and the fire burning

[chorus]

uh and its scary to carry
a smooth-type flow like a drink of merlot
thatll freak yall out like a girl virgo
when i turbo on any track its a reynolds wrap
and i rap like a nigga who invented rap rapping heat
you could fall to defeat if you dont pay your tolls
like the limbs on your feet i suppose
this is bigger than life
this is probably everybody illuminatis
guess im the blood sacrifice
of the party i undress her like a harley
lights will flash cars will crash
smoke more junk while the junkies laugh
so my bad if i put you in rehab
you are reimbursed put it on my tab

[chorus]

[kendrick lamar - over chorus]

[kendrick lamar]
uh i wrote this song when dave drove home
and caught that flat in the [] flats
and it made me think when another car blinked
to change locations where we at
we often get lost in the ever-hard bottle
when attempt to ignore pain problem and sorrow
just for a minute then back to the bullshit
your car now due and you bout to get evicted
two drugs surely patron pussy make it feel alright
but once its empty and the bitch leave then its back to life
you cant run from it gotta run to it nigga
the antidote wouldnt last and you knew it nigga
but still you proceed to dive deep ask whats her zodiac sign

[chorus 2x]

[ab-soul]

[chorus 2x]

[kendrick lamar - screwed vocals]

so lets go-go-go-go lets go-go-go-go
lets go-go-go-go lets go lets go

[kendrick lamar]
uh she got me going im all in
fifty stories im falling
where you been is it planet mars
far beyond the stars are you a martian
youre unfamiliar but still i feel ya
energy is sending me toward the ceiling
im high now are you up there
if you was i would climb every other stair
i gotta stare i mean wow
and im wowed no one compares
a one-on-one you must have won
every pageant in america when you was young
lips hips hair drip down her back crazy
body frame crazy insane crazy
the only girl that can make time then make me stop

[chorus]

[kendrick lamar]
uh so now we on so now we gone
living in the city of the unknown
i show her off i stunt with her
we do it sweet they look bitter
look at her get up i hear em say
but why him i hear em hate
i laugh at it rather than jab at it
then continue eternal life as a crack addict
cause im addicted and you the drug
cold turkey no sir
gotta be an odyssey from heaven way above
you definite not probably i gotta give it up
lips hips hair drip down her back crazy
body frame crazy insane crazy
the only girl that can make time then make me stop

[chorus]

[kendrick lamar]
you something different
im glad i found you
so pretty
ill never do anything to hurt you[female crying]

[kendrick lamar]
uh yeah [3x]
uh
we hurt people that love us love people that hurt us
hurt people that love us love people
im inspired so get inspired

and so he said why you gotta be so kind-hearted
why you couldnt be a con-artist why you couldnt
why you couldnt be mischievous or just a lil devious
the moment that we first started
why you never ask for nothing just a lil time
why you let me use yours cause i dont got mines
why you always lift me up when im completely giving up
or when niggas holler whats up you give a dry response
why you giving me your last knowing you aint got it
why you always buy me something when you going shopping
why you tell me that you love me why you always thinking of me
want my company rather than going club hopping
why you treating my momma like she your momma too
why you making promises that youll forever do
whatever just to make me happy wanting us to have a family
these are exactly the reasons why i cheat on you sometimes

[chorus kendrick lamar javonte]
we hurt people that love us love people that hurt us
hurt people that love us love people that hurt us
hurt people that love us love people that hurt us
hurt people that love us love people that hurt us
sometimes i sometimes i feel we share
nothing in common it aint fair
but where do we seem to fall
where do we seem to fall
tender love and care once upon a time
once upon a time we was there

[kendrick lamar]
and so she said why you gotta be so mean to me
why you dont know what you mean to me
why you always playing games why i feel like you ashamed
out in public curse me out and make a scenery
why you got other bitches rolling their eyes at me
why text messages popping up saying hi daddy
why you treat me like im nothing why you always at a function
i be wanting to go out but you dont never ask me
why you slip and say her name when we having sex
why you always assuming that i still love my ex
every time we get into it im the one thats feeling stupid
you dont need me you gon leave me thats your favorite threat
why you never know how it feel to be lonely
why i feel im the last option after your homies
why you always gotta know that i will never let you go
even though you get violent and put your hands on me sometimes

[chorus]

[outro lamont carey she says she loves me]
she says she loves me she says she loves me
so she clings to me even when i want to be left alone
but shes beautiful
like sometimes when i have things on my mind shes the perfect person to listen
and she only gives advice she says when i give her a cue
she says she loves me
like when i wake up in the morning
shes sitting on the edge of the bed with a plate of food wanting to feed me
she says she needs me she says she loves me
or like when im stepping out of the shower
shes standing there with the towel wanting to wanting to dry me off
she says she says she loves me
so instead of admitting that she has made another mistake
she says she says she loves me
and i dont know about love[female]
i used to want to be like michael jordan
figured i would hit the nba and make me a fortune

[chorus 1 kendrick lamar]
uh every time im in my city i be hacking like my shit dont stink

[verse 1]
kill him where he stand or stand over him shake his hand
then jump back in that mini van double back to his block
and blam i aint backing down for nothing
im a back em down like shaq with this black 2-2-3 in my hand
better pray that this chopper jam like a radio single man
police radio signals sayin that a 187 land on your corner
coroners comfort your mama mama hes dead
the next morning high toasted up with my homies
we drink and smoke marijuana want us to change our ways uh-huh
you see this game we play come from uncles that raised me in compton
ask me what i have accomplished
i dont know i dont have conscience
i just load up and start dumpin on enemies im head hunting
no sympathy aint no love when you in these streets just get something
protect ya neck cause they comin for set respects split your onion
then chop your deck your head tumblin like gymnastics
cause ignorance is bliss

[verse 2]
this the hardest shit youve heard from la this far
and im this far from a discharge but never will i dish off
we all tryna ball and when i got the rock ill dish off
until the day i pistol whip you posers till yall pissed off
then peel off in a hooptie
come back and make these niggas wanna shoot me
and they bitches wanna salute me or seduce me
indubitably im too street
indubitably im a do me
better than your bitch would
but you niggas too weak but just give me 2 weeks
and im good
ill make an album thatll put a smile on malcolm
make martin luther tell god im the future for heavens talent
no tarot card reading im foreseeing you niggas vanish
not only from the rap game im including the planet
cats so watered down clowns can sink titanic
tie titanium around their neck and watch em panic
give me respect dammit or get damaged
die young corpse identified by your parents
apparently you a parrot
mocking me and my blueprint
but i wont share it just make you cop it then call you a sheriff
stop it im hearin the comments
the critics are calling me conscious
but truthfully every shooter be callin me compton
so truthfully only calling me kweli and common
proves that ignorance is bliss

[verse 3]
and this still the hardest shit youve heard from la this far
and im this far from a discharge but never will i dish off
this my world i grab the universe then play kickball
and they wonder why these california earthquakes hit so hard
im so-cal you so called
rappers need to go call
ghostbusters to shoot busters im casper when i go off
i show up to show out to show off
you a hundred percent behind me
and if you hard then wreck your car and walk up to my crime scene
i remember being 17 wishing someone would sign me
now the only way these labels get me back is when they rewind me
backin down boggins
backin down bitches
we gon flip her once she off that blue dolphin
you gon tip her
cause ignorance is bliss
and willy b im a fool on yo beats i bleed out the speaker
as the speaker that spoke when they done speak[kendrick lamar]
this is me thinking at 443 am june 6

sometimes i wanna say fuck rapping i need money now
like should i start trapping if what i write down
dont connect this very moment then im on it no question
in the streets my niggas is well connected lets see
do i cop a pound of kush promethazine or push some e
oxycontin have laying on soft cotton when i sleep
this is deep as the abyss im not just rhyming on the beat
i be in spots chopping the rocks like flintstone feet
this is me frustrated battling my own evils
finna saddle up that work across ohio in a geo
or should i sell my music zip to buy your zip
and hope one day it flourish to a kilo track record of a hustler
rather records on the needle making music
clocking fast bank like a shot from patrick ewing
my nigga what you doing on these corners with me
i thought you had a show well i guess my nigga i didnt
im tryna get this dough and easy money sounds tempting
especially when your homies pushing v8 hinges
twenty-two on twenty-sixes range rovers rolling up
three-fifty for an ounce of fire i hope i got enough
this industry calling my bluff i need a new solution
curve-serving know i might be in your store boosting
two-elevens with mac-11s like fuck hip hop
dont wanna be pun dont wanna be big dont wanna be pac
just give me your funds aka everything that you got
or everything getting shot for nothing
leave you in shock coughing up blood and mumbling
watch the plans of a young man sponsor
moving grams like relocating your moms momma
then expand to the hoover dam water
sherm contraband they yearn for the butt-naked
fuck a verse verses get let off in thirty minutes six seconds
i disperse to the world of unruly where i put the mic down
and pick up a sack and a toolie if you knew me
youll know i always had a passion for riddle when writing
but lately ive been thinking bout taking chances to brighten
my future financially so please dont be mad at me
i gotta do what i gotta do no shit
so i tell my nigga front me let me put it on the strip
then give it back when i think about the consequence shit

[bj the chicago kid]
there are times when you need someone
i will be by your side
oh darling cause there is a light that shines
special for you and me yeah
i-take-i-take-take my chances-chances-chances
before they pass they pass they pass
pass me by oh darling
youve got to look at the other side

[kendrick lamar]
rotc or right on time conscience[kendrick lamar]
one time
reporting live compton california

have you ever felt like like you never get life
like you never get right sort of like a black sheep
back down backing out your dreams like some bad sleep
chasing for the win but you never win the track meet
oh what a cold world for a broke nigga its bitter
and lifes a bitch dont hit women so i bit her
i struck enough pain let her know i wasnt playing
i was so sincere like nas first name
and back theyd tell me its very difficult to see twenty-five
and if i survive i probably wouldnt sell it
my opportunities are low because my brown complexion floats
in the ghetto rather in some heals like giuseppes
they want me unemployed until i hit the streets
for filling voids of broke d-boys selling weed
fucking up my prestige till i live with the blues
bb king or the neighbors of snoop

[chorus kendrick lamar ash riser {uncredited female}]
thats why im in the club like fuck it though
they say its only one life life life
and if you say i cant live comfortable
ima tell you thats a lie lie lie
so while i hold this bottle of ciroc with a hand full of ass
celebrate the very day that i get past
through the barbed wire
{we are we are fighters
we are we are true
through the through barbed wires
we will will break through}
so while i hold this bottle of ciroc with a hand full of ass
celebrate the very day that i get past
through the barbed wire

[kendrick lamar]
have you ever felt like like you never get life
like you never did right sort of like a black sheep
tryna get away from the world stereotype
barbed wire got a barricade on your destiny
she desperately in need of some inspiration see what the people saying
she gon have a baby then flee from her education
at the age of sixteen credit card scam schemes
see a scar on her eye boyfriend brutality
she will never get by no how no way
welfare recipient property of the state
housing section 8 corner store prostitute
the owner bout to prosecute the niggas tell her that she cute
hoodrat trashy six baby daddies
and this baby daddy is new to the family
chilling in pajamies waiting on the first
fast-forward spilling drinks on her fur

[chorus kendrick lamar ash riser {uncredited female}]
thats why she in the club like fuck it though
they say its only one life life life
and if you say she cant live comfortable
she gon tell you thats a lie lie lie
so while she up in vip pouring merlot in her glass
celebrate the very day that she get past
through the barbed wire
{we are we are fighters
we are we are true
through the through barbed wires
we will will break through}
so while she up in vip pouring merlot in her glass
celebrate the very day that she get past
through the barbed wire

[kendrick lamar]
have you ever felt like you finally got life
you finally got right no longer a black sheep
living off your dreams like christina uh-milian in the front seat
of a convertible eloping to get married
what a feeling of overcoming the odds
its like you just hit the lottery my god
there must be a god cause golly
you done made it through the fight while squabbling ali
now your lifestyles looking up and you escaped the crooked cops
and you aint have to kill a nigga just to make a couple bucks
and she aint have to go and fuck on everybody for a dollar
making good decisions got an independent business mind
and both of yall are steady grinding doing it the legal way
just tryna make a decent pay on every second of the day
but they wont give you the credit disses out they mouth
you must have joined the illuminati just to ball out

[chorus kendrick lamar ash riser]
in the club like fuck it though
they say its only one life life life
and if you say they cant live comfortable
they gon tell you thats a lie lie lie
so even if you overcame doubt and your living aint bad
know its some barbed wire thats always in your path
through the barbed wire

[kendrick lamar]

disappear into the night and im gone

[outro]
so you made it past all the barbed wires
just one more left [gun shot]the hardest thing for me to do
is to get you to know me within sixteen bars
thats the hardest thing

who is k dot a young nigga from compton
on the curb writing raps next to a gun shot
on the corners where the gangsters and the killers dwell
the fraudulent tender scars that get unveiled
everyone i knew was either crip or piru
cousins in elementary relatives in high school
with that being said each one of their rivals
was aiming something at my head i needed survival
got jumped got jacked shot at shot back
and i dont even push a line im just tryna push these rhymes
in the midst of staying neutral and discrete
my momma said youre judged by the company you keep
but what you can consider that if it goes down
theyll kill you if you kill me it gets deep nigga
so if you ask what im doing
im tryna duck the influence of my city thats blue-and real talk and

[chorus]
this is why they fuck with me real talk nigga believe it
this is why they fuck with me do what i do yknow
im no gangster no killer im just your average joe know that
but one thing you should consider im the realest you know

i was walking from centennial
when an unidentified vehicle rolled up and i was like hold up
where you from how-bang
where you stay westside thats a piru gang to be exact
well aware they had blue across they hat
dropped backpack and ran inside of the cul-de-sac
shots rang out hoping to god i wasnt wet
crossed to cross rosecrans and ran inside of the yet
chirped the homies on the hot ninety-five they said they already knew
what happened and meet em outside the garage
never seen that many guns in my life
i was paranoid like a fiend in the night but needed revenge
grabbed the nine-ball opened up the door then got in
somebody said fall back we gon make these niggas suffer
you my brother like a frat and thats just to remind you
thought about that so long i had failed my finals fuck but

[chorus]
this is why they fuck with me i told you nigga
this is why they fuck with me you fake nigga
im no gangster no killer im just your average joe you fake
but one thing you should consider im the realest you know

i dont do black music i dont do white music
i do everyday life music
give em cuts like a nigga pierced a knife through it
you say you through but ive been through it now thats cold
and this is for my county building children
in hub city on hubcaps no power-steering
i use perseverance in this mad city
where the niggas drink remy and hold semis for cutthroats
bernie mac died its no joke
dont ask why if you dont know about these killers and thieves
seven grams of weed you smoke that but im high off life
i could fall out the sky like twice
and land in the land of the aks
and the minivans where the fan never on
cause its hotter than a lunatics underarms in a straitjacket
in other words we get it cracking but i keep it cool yknow

[chorus]
this is why they fuck with me [laughs]
this is why they fuck with me real talk
im no gangster no killer im just your average joe come on
but one thing you should consider im the realest you know

so there you have it
but im a leave you with this

or behind the scenes getting real money

everybody know i spit that hunk of shit
shit that make you duck for cover shit
shit that make you hop out your seat and slap your mother shit
especially when drop drop the beat
i drop jewels like my nuts dropped out of my briefs
jump in the booth then shatter every rappers dream
they jump in a sauna because i killed their self-esteem
thats a jab you should bob and weave
like pam when martin pulled jokes out his sleeve
i go in studio sessions and feel like a nerd
cause im the only nigga there not smoking no herb
you telling me the kush make you think on level four
im on five you saying i can level more
in high school my teachers thought i was smoking stress
didnt know my eyes low cause of genetic defects
i stimulate my mind every time i think about the end of time
creation of man and columbine

[chorus]
bet you think that this some high shit that i wrote
probably think im off the kush or the hydro
i dont even smoke i dont even smoke
i dont even smoke i dont even smoke
i really appreciate that you share your endo
but a sip of henny is the farthest i would go
i dont even smoke i dont even smoke
i dont even smoke i dont even smoke

look nowadays everybody think they big chiefers
just cause they heard that new tape from wiz khalifa
knowing damn well they cant hit the sour
they new booties they probably need baby powder
my skill shower over your city for forty days
forty nights off the chain like freedom of slaves
before you get it twisted like forty gays
my flow worth the earth thats not to be appraised
those the type of lines that im talking bout
you know the type of rhymes you dont talk about
copy my session on a disc when the session ends
so my mama can have it and play it for her friends
brag on me like my sons bout to win
somehow someday and i dont care when
i might hit the gin once a month
ill let you inhale/in hell like an atheist

[chorus]

uhh ill take you back to the ninth grade
when dough boy had me high for four days
thats my nigga he a street nigga
probably in your hood fucking up your street nigga
but anyway i think it was some purple
told me dont hit it hard because itll hurt you
i didnt listen i was floating like the rose parade
swear to god a nigga seen some flying fishes
that was the vegas trip hooters sponsored
the same time i start writing like a fucking monster
im frankenstein every time this motherfucker ponders
just underline every letter
capital k-d-o-t letting it flat out
like a tire with slow leaks and what you bout

i read about napoleon hill and try to know god
they say he the key to my blessings
and if i speak the good into existence that instant my dreams will unlock
money flow like water ill just wait at the dock
and by the way ima start finding more light to shed
like a small garage in your backyard
im back chilling with a friend of mine she mighty fine
but i notice that her heart resides next to bitterness
always hollering who she dont like and who she kick it with
who she wanna fight who wearing a weave
who dooney &amp; bourke bag is fake who holding the keys
to the car she drove last year or who fucking on who
and who need a pap smear getting on my nerves
but before your negative energy curve bitch ima cut you off

where so-and-so from and what neighborhoods beefing

now paint that picture life behind bars
remember the very day i got caught
i murdered a rapper and you filed the police report

but indeed them too can run me right up a tree
constantly talking shit bout the next relative
wanting me to take sides but id never give in
ever since grandma died everyone parted ways
argue on holidays left my uncle in prison

hiiipower is the way we think the way we live
see its known today that the human race is nothing
no moral no standards
what were about to do is raise the level of expectations
no you dont have to have a lot of money
you dont have to be rich
but you will be rich in mind and spirit

hiiipower we stand for it as if its as big as a religionmy nigga what it look like

cow intestines botox injection earthquakes thats government testing
secret society weapon opium plant manifested

to hold us back great depression amongst iraq no direction
no google map just a tec for the soowoo
swerving isuzu then blah-blah-blah adolescents go cuckoo

in the daily superstition
that the word is bout to end
who gives a fuck we never do listen
unless it comes with an 808
a melody and some hoes
playstation and some drank
technology bumping soul
looking around and all i see
is a big crowd thats product of me

then she said read between the lines
yep hope that i get close enough
when the lights turn down
and the fact that she just might open up
when the new flow start to drown
her body and i know the both of us really deep in the move now
its nothing we can do now
somebody walked in with a pound
of that bay area kush
she looked at me then looked

then she said get it understood

i used to want to see the penitentiary way after elementary
thought it was cool to look the judge in the face when he sentenced me
since my uncles was institutionalised
my intuition has said i was suited for family ties
my mama is stressing my daddy tired
i need me a weapon these niggas ride
every minute hour and second ministers tried
to save me how im gon listen when i dont even hear god
heaven or hell base it all on my instincts
my hands dirty you worried bout mud in your sink
you like to mistake a street nigga for real nigga
that same nigga that kill with ya squeal with ya
i deal with ya like my son stare at the sun
and youll be looking in my eyes homie
stand for something or fall for anything
and you working with two left feet at the skating rink
but anyway this for my niggas
uncles twenty-three hours sending me pictures
i want you to know that im so determined to blow
that you hear the music i wrote hope it get you off death row
you came home to a pocket full of stones
a metropc phone then you went back in
so when i touch the pen the pen is in my view
ima get it right just so you

you like to mistake a street nigga for real nigga
that same nigga that kill with ya squeal with ya
id like to start it out from the bottom and build with ya
be on my last dollar and split the bill with ya
im twenty-three with morals and plans of living cordial
not rich but wealthy theres nothing you can tell me
my killings are not remorseful the city got my back
before that i give them my torso
you think about it and dont call me lyrical
cause really im just a nigga thats evil and spiritual
i know some rappers using big words to make they similes curve
my simplest shit be more pivotal
i penetrate the hearts of good kids and criminals
worry some individuals that live life critical
so wont you bare witness while i bare feet
so you can walk in my shoes and get to know me
but anyway this for my pops
on his lunch break eating in that parking lot
on wanna be heard probably thought he worked my nerves
but really he was stressing me getting what i deserved
somebody said my name on the radio he aint know

so the next time he roll up and drop grams in it hell probably be
out of work laid back while he

verse 1 - kendrick lamar
and lord knows shes beautiful
lord knows the usuals
leaving her body sore
she take the little change she make
to fix her nail cuticles lipstick is suitable
to make you fiend for more
she play mr shakur
thats her favorite rapper
bumping brendas got a baby
while a pervert yelling at her
and she capture features of a woman
but only 17 and 7 cars start honkin
she start running like flo-jo
dont care if they joe blow
if they got money to blow a blow job is a sure go
and sure enough dont see a dime of dirty dollars
she givin all to her daddy but she dont know her father thats ironic
see a block away from lueders park i seen the el camino parked
in her heart she hate it there but in her mind she made it where
nothing really matters so she hit the back seat
rosa parks never a factor when she making ends meet

hook

verse 2
and lord knows shes beautiful
lord knows the usuals leaving a body sore
her anatomy is gods temple and its quite simple
her castle is about to be destroyed shes always paranoid
watching the law inside the streets undercovers the dummies that look like decoys
remember sergeant let her slide said if he seen
whats between her thighs hed compromise to no surprise
she took the ultimatum around the alleyway and gave him
a warm welcome to fill him right below the navel
though he was wired up like a pair of jumping cables
his eyes was closed shut prior charges he had waived em
it was a block away from lueders park i seen a squad car parked
and in her heart she hate it there but in her mind she made it where
nothing really matters so she hit the back seat
cause rosa parks never a factor when she topping off police

hook

verse 3
and lord knows shes beautiful
lord knows the usuals leaving a body sore
as she bust down like a 12 bunk on tour
she suddenly realized shell never escape the allure
of the black man white man needed satisfaction at first
it became a practice but now shes numb to it
sometimes she wonder if she can do it like nuns do it
but she never heard of catholic religion or sinners redemption
that sounds foolish and you can blame it on her mother
for letting her boyfriend slide candy under her cover
ten months before she was ten he moved in and thats when he touched her
this muthaf-cka is the f-cking reason why keisha rushing through that
block away from lueders park i seen a el camino park
and in her heart she hate it there but in her mind she made it where
nothing really matters so she hit the back seat
and caught a knife inside the bladder left her dead raped in the street

keishas song

my little sister eleven i looked her right in the face
the day that i wrote this song set her down and pressed play

verse 1
and this is rigamortis and its gorgeous when you die
ali recorded and im morpheus the matrix of my mind
im out the orbit you an orphan and a hairdresser combined
im on the toilet when i rhyme if you the shit then i decline
i climax where you begin and then i end on cloud 9
and thats important when you morph into a angel in the sky
and dont be forging all my signatures my listeners reply and tell me
that you biting style you got a hell of an appetite
and imma be here for a while just buckle up before the ride
or knuckle up if you could fight we always making them duck or die
a suit and tie is suitable and usual in suicide
csi just might investigate this fucking parasite

verse 2
he dead amen thats what they telling me
aim it at your celebrity this is studio felony
ferragami so many and cool enough for the 70s
nigga paybacks a bitch and bitch you been living in debt with me
that i more than especially leave a call on his mother voicemail
to say that he rest in peace bigger chopper the recipe
wrestling thats irrelevant rather rest at your residence
whistling to the melody couldnt think of a better d
better be on your p and q its just me jay rock soul and q
so the system aint barbeque aint nothing else you can do

he dead yup-yup amen i killed him
he dead haha amen amen

hook

verse 3
i rapped him and made him casper i captured the likes of nasa
my pedigree to fly past ya i pass the weed to the pastor
we all are sinners wont you send us to bible study faster
your hypocrite-esque reaction a blasphemy
i assassin my casualty and its casually done and tell em my salary come
a lump sum of hundreds dont talk to be bout no money
the sun is under my feet and i come in peace to compete
i dont run if you rather leap my statistics go up in weeks
and i go visit the nearest creek and i get busy on many mc
really ballistic anybody can see any assistance everybody done see
some persistence recognize i be really too vicious the permanent beast
and the demolition breaking up the streets better partition better dot your t
and i gon mention how the far you see putting my dick in the rap industry
everybody bitchin getting mad at me recognize kendrick in the battery
and im charged up and the catastrophe is charged up and the audacity

im dying inside i wonder if zion inside the heavens

thats all i see in my life and they tell me to make it right
but im right on the edge on everest and i might jump tonight
have you ever had known a saint that was taking sinners advice
well its probably you am i right if im wrong you a fucking lie
when i lie on back and look at the ceiling its so appealing to pray
i wonder if im just a villain dealing my morals away
some people look at my face then tell me dont worry bout it
i give em back they deposit no money just total silence
im running they say im wildin a youngun with lack of guidance
theres hundreds of us with problems more money more drugs and violence
look at the soul of an out-of-control artist thats dealing with life the hardest
thats on my life but regardless ima

[bj the chicago kid]
yeah life can please ya but death can tease ya
on the day niko had that seizure i lost one of my biggest believers ohh
close deaths make you think about your life
like if i had the same chance twice what would i do different
id tell her i loved her more do more
but tease her bout crying on that picture
now when im done recording swear i let the beat bang in her name
make her shake her head in heaven saying they at it again
make them clouds turn to speakers
dont take too much smoke from the reefer
love being in the room with her peoples

i met her at this house party on el segundo and central 
she had the credentials of strippers in atlanta
ass came with a hump from the jump she was a camel
i want to ride like arabians
push an 04 mercedes-benz
hello my name is kendrick
she said no youre handsome
whispered in my ear disappeared then found her dancing
ciara had played in the background
the parade music we made had us all wearing shades now cool
where you stay
she said down the street from dominguez high
okay i know thats borderline compton or paramount
well is it compton
no she replied and quickly start batting her eyes and
strictly had one of her thighs around me
seventeen with nothing but pussy stuck on my mental
my motive was rather sinful
what you trying to get into
she didnt tell just gave me her nextel
dropped the number we chirped the whole summer and well

the summer had passed and now im liking her
conversation we having probably enticing her
who could imagine maybe my actions would end up wifing her
love or lust regardless well fuck cause the trife in us
its deep rooted the music of being young and dumb
its never muted in fact its much louder where im from
we know a lot bout each other her mother was a crack addict
she live with her granny and her younger two brothers
her favorite cousin demetrius has a reputable
history of gang banging did make me skeptical
but not enough to stop me from getting a nut
i wanna come over whats up
thats what i told her soon as this episode
of martin go off
im trying to get off
i was in heat like a cactus my tactics of being thirsty
probably could hurt me but fuck it i got some heart
grab my mommas keys hopped in the car then oh boy

so now im down rosecrans in a caravan
passing alameda my gas meter in need of a pump
i got enough to get me through the traffic jam
at least i hope cause my pockets broke as a promise man
im thinking bout that sex 
thinking bout her thighs or maybe kissing on her neck 
or maybe what positions next
sent her pictures of her titties blowing up my texts
i looked at em and almost ran my front bumper into corvette
enthused by the touch of a woman shes a masseuse
and im a professional porn star when off the goose
i had a fifth in the trunk like curtis jackson for ransom
i hoping to get her loose like an uncle luke anthem
im two blocks away 250 feet and six steps from where she stay
she waving me cross the street
i pulled up a smile on my face
and then i see
two niggas two black hoodies
i froze as my phone rangi am a sinner

ill education baby
want to reconnect with your relations
this is your station baby

look inside these walls and you see them having withdrawals
of a prisoner on his way
trapped inside your desire
to fire bullets that stray
track a tire just tell you im tired and ran away
i should ask a choir what do you require
to sing a song that acquire me to have faith
as the record spin i should pray
for the record i recognize that im easily prey
i got ate alive yesterday
i got animosity building
its probably big as a building
me jumping off of the roof
is just me playing it safe
but what am i supposed to do
when the topic is red or blue
and you understand that i aint
but know im accustomed to
just a couple that look for trouble
and live in the street with rank
no better picture to paint than me walking from bible study
and called his homies because he had said he noticed my face
from a function that tooken place
they was wondering if i bang
step on my neck and get blood on your nike checks
i dont mind because one day you respect
the good kid maad city

mass hallucination baby
ill education baby
want to reconnect with your relations
this is your station baby

all i see is strobe lights
blinding me in my hindsight
finding me by myself
promise me you can help
in all honesty i got time to be copacetic
and finally made decision to hold me against my will
it was like a head on collision that folded me standing still
i can never pick out the difference
 or cop on the bill
every time you clock in the morning
i feel you just want to kill
all my innocence while ignoring my purpose
to persevere as a better person
i know you heard this and probably in fear
but what am i supposed to do
with the blinking of red and blue
flash from the top of your roof
and your dog has to say proof
and you ask lift up your shirt
cause you wonder if a tattoo
of affiliation can make it a pleasure to put me through
gang files but that dont matter because the matter is racial profile
i heard them chatter hes probably young but i know that hes down
step on his neck as hard as your bullet proof vest
he dont mind he know we never respect
the good kid maad city

mass hallucination baby
ill education baby
want to reconnect with your relations
this is your station baby

all i see in this room
20 xanies and these shrooms
grown-up candy for pain
can we live in the same society
its entirely stressful upon my brain
you hired me as a victim
i quietly hope for change
when violence is the rhythm
inspired me to obtain
the silence in this room
with 20 xanies and shrooms
some grown-up candy i lost it
i feel its nothing to lose
the streets sure to release the worst side of my best
dont mind cause now you ever in debt
to good kid maad city

mass hallucination baby
ill education baby
want to reconnect with your relations
this is your station babyif pirus and crips all got along
theyd probably gun me down by the end of this song

this is not a rap on how im slingin crack or move cocaine

not the drill sergeant but the stress that weighing on your brain
it was me l boogs and yan yan yg lucky ride down rosecrans
it got ugly waving your hand out the window check yo self
uh warriors and conans
hope euphoria can slow dance with society
the driver seat the first one to get killed
seen a light-skinned nigga with his brains blown out
at the same burger stand where hang out

but ever since that day i was lookin at him different
that was back when i was nine

when you hop on that trolley
make sure your colors correct
make sure youre cornbread or theyll be calling your mother collect

imma teach you some lessons about the street
it aint nothin but a compton thang
chyea
how we do

fresh outta school cause i was a high school grad
sleeping in the living room in my mommas pad
reality struck i seen the white car crash
hit the light pole two niggas hopped out on foot and dashed
my pops said i needed a job i thought i believed him
security guard for a month and ended up leaving
in fact i got fired because i was inspired by all of my friends
to stage a robbery the third saturday i clocked in
projects tore up gang signs get thrown up
cocaine laced in marijuana
and they wonder why i rarely smoke now
imagine if your first blunt had you foaming at the mouth
i was straight tweaking the next weekend we broke even
i made a legion then made a promise to see you bleeding
you know the reasons but still wont ever know my life
kendrick aka comptons human sacrifice

cocaine weed
niggas been mixing shit since the 80s loc
shine sticks buck nakeds
make a nigga flip
cluck heads all up and down the block and shit
one times crooked and shit
block a nigga in
alondra rosecrans bullis
im still in the hood
loc yeah thats cool
the hood took me under so i follow the rules
but yeah thats like me i grew up in the hood where they bang
and niggas that rep colors is doing the same thing
pass it to the left so i can smoke on me
a couple drive-bys in the hood lately
couple of ivs with the fucking spraycan
shots in the crowd then everybody ran
crew im finna slay the street life i crave
shots hit the enemy harsh turn brave
mount up regulators in the whip
down the boulevard with the pistol grip
trip we in the hood still
so loc grab a strap cause yeah its so real
deal with the outcome a strap in the hand
and a bird and 10 grands where motherfuckers stand

if i told you i killed a nigga at 16 would you believe me
or see me to be innocent kendrick that you seen in the street
with a basketball and some now &amp; laters to eat
if im mashing all of my skeletons would you jump in the seat
would you say my intelligence now is great relief
and its safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep
with dreams of being a lawyer or doctor
instead of boy with a chopper that hold the cul de sac hostage
kill them all if they gossip the children of the corn
they realizing the option of living a lie drive they body with toxins
constantly drinking and drive hit the powder then watch this flame
that arrive in his eye; this a coward the concept is aim and
they bang it and slide out that bitch with the pies
and the price on his head the tots probably go to the projects
i live inside the belly of the rough
compton usa made me an angel on angel dust whatpour up drank head shot drank
sit down drank stand up drank
pass out drank wake up drank
faded drank faded drank

now i done grew up
round some people living their life in bottles
granddaddy had the golden flask
back stroke every day in chicago
some people like the way it feels
some people wanna kill their sorrows
some people wanna fit in with the popular
that was my problem
i was in the dark room
loud tunes looking to make a vow soon
that imma get fucked up fillin up my cup
i see the crowd mood
changing by the minute and the record on repeat
took a sip then another sip then somebody said to me

aw man what is she taking
where is she taking
all i all i all i all i
all i have in life is my new appetite for failure
and i got hunger pain that grow insane
tell me do that sound familiar
if it do then youre like me
making excuse that your relief
is in the bottom of the bottle
and the greenest indo leaf
as the window open
i release everything that corrode inside of me
i see you joking why you laugh
dont you feel bad
i probably sleep and never ever wake up
never ever wake up never ever wake up
in god i trust
but just when i thought i had enoughwhen the lights shut off
and its my turn to settle down
my main concern
promise that you will sing about me
promise that you will sing about me
i said when the lights shut off
and its my turn to settle down
my main concern
promise that you will sing about me
promise that you will sing about me

i woke up this morning and figured id call you
in case im not here tomorrow im hoping that i can borrow
a peace of mind im behind on whats really important
my mind is really distorted i find nothing but trouble in my life
im fortunate you believe in a dream
this orphanage we call a ghetto is quite a routine
and last night was just another distraction or a reaction
of what we consider madness i know exactly what happened
you ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help
held him like a newborn baby and made him feel
like everything was alright and a fight he tried to put up
but the type of bullet that stuck had went against his will
as blood spilled on your hands my plans rather vindictive
everybodys a victim in my eyes
when i ride its a murderous rhythm and outside became pitch black
a demon glued to my back whispering get em
i got em and i aint give a fuck
that same mentality that told my brother not to duck
in actuality its a trip how we trip off of colors
i wonder if ill ever discover a passion like you and recover
the life that i knew as a youngn in pajamas and dun-ta-duns
when thunder comes it rains cats and dogs
dumb niggas like me never prosper
prognosis of a problem child im proud and well devoted
this piru shit been in me forever
so forever imma push it wherever whenever
and i love you cause you love my brother like you did
just promise me youll tell this story when you make it big
and if i die before your album drop i hope

promise that you will sing about me
promise that you will sing about me
i said when the lights shut off
and its my turn to settle down
my main concern
promise that you will sing about me
promise that you will sing about me

you wrote a song about my sister on your tape
and called it section80 the message resembled brendas got a baby
whats crazy was i was hearin about it
but doubted your ignorance how could you ever just put her on blast and shit
judging her past and shit well its completely my future
her nigga behind me right now asking for ass and shit
and imma need that 40 dollars even if i gotta
fuck suck and swallow in the parking lot
gonzales park im followed by a married man a father of three
my titties bounce on the cadence of his tinkling keys
matter of fact he my favorite ’cause he tip me with es
he got a cousin named david and i seen him last week
this is the life of another girl damaged by the system
these foster homes i run away and never do miss em
see my hormones just run away and if i can get em back
to where they used to be then ill probably be in the denim
of a family gene that show women how to be woman
or better yet a leader you need her to learn somethin
then you probably need to beat her thats how i was taught
three niggas in one room first time i was tossed
and im exhausted but fuck that sorry for your loss shit
my sister died in vain but what point are you trying to gain
if you cant fit the pumps i walk in
ill wait
your rebuttal a little too late
and if you have a album date just make sure im not in the song
cause i dont need the attention bring enough of that on my own
and matter fact did i mention that i physically feel great
a doctors approval is a waste of time i know im straight
ill probably live longer than you and never fade away
ill never fade away ill never fade away i know my fate
and im on the grind for this cake imma get it or die trying
im eyeing every male gender with intentions of buying
you lying to these motherfuckers talking about you can help em
with my story you can help me if you sell this pussy for me nigga
dont ignore me nigga fuck your glory nigga

when the lights shut off
and its my turn to settle down
my main concern
promise that you will sing about me
promise that you will sing about me
i said when the lights shut off
and its my turn to settle down
my main concern
promise that you will sing about me
promise that you will sing about me

sometimes i look in a mirror and ask myself
am i really scared of passing away if its today i hope i hear a
cry out from heaven so loud it can water down a demon
with the holy ghost till it drown in the blood of jesus
i wrote some raps that make sure that my lifeline
reeking the scent of a reaper ensuring that my allegiance
with the other side may come soon and if im doomed
may the wound help my mother be blessed for many moons
i suffer a lot and every day the glass mirror
get tougher to watch i tie my stomach in knots
and im not sure why im infatuated with death
my imagination is surely an aggravation of threats
that can come about cause the tongue is mighty powerful
and i can name a list of your favorites that probably vouch
maybe cause im a dreamer and sleep is the cousin of death
really stuck in the schema of wonderin when imma rest
and youre right your brother was a brother to me
and your sisters situation was the one that pulled me
in a direction to speak of something thats realer than the tv screen
by any means wasnt trying to offend or come between
her personal life i was like it need to be told
cursing the life of twenty generations after her soul
exactly whatd happen if i aint continued rappin
or steady being distracted by money drugs and four
fives i count lives all on these songs
look at the weak and cry pray one day youll be strong
fighting for your rights even when youre wrong
and hope that at least one of you sing about me when im gone
am i worth it did i put enough work in

promise that you will sing about me
promise that you will sing about me
i said when the lights shut off
and its my turn to settle down
my main concern
promise that you will sing about me
promise that you will sing about me

promise that youll sing about me forever
promise that youll sing about me for ooh
promise that youll sing about me forever
promise that youll sing about me for ooh
promise that youll sing about me forever
promise that youll sing about me for ooh

you love red-bottom and gold they say queen
you love hand-bag on the waist of your jean
you love french tip and trip that pay for
you love bank slip that tell you we paid more
you love a good hand whenever the card dealt
but what love got to do with it when you dont love yourself

i do what i wanna do

i dont love anything else
but what love got to do with it when i dont love myself
to the point i should hate everything i do love
should i hate living my life inside the club
should i hate her for watching me for that reason
should i hate him for telling me that im season
should i hate them for telling me ball out
should i hate street credibility im talkin about

i used to be jealous of aaron afflalo
i used to be jealous of aaron afflalo
he was the one to follow
he was the only leader foreseeing brighter tomorrows
he would live in the gym
we was living in sorrow
total envy of him
he made a dream become a reality
actually making it possible to swim
his way out of compton with further more to accomplish
graduate with honors a sponsor of basketball scholars
its 2004 and im watching him score 30
remember vividly how them victory points had hurt me
cause every basket was a reaction or a reminder
that we was just moving backwards
the bungalow where you find us
the art of us ditching classes heading nowhere fast
stick my head inside the study hall he focused on math
determination ambition plus dedication and wisdom
qualities he was given was the shit we didnt have
dug inside of his book bag and coach palmer asked for his finals
he had his back like a spinal meanwhile
we singing the same old song spinning the vinyl
11 graders gone wrong
he focused on the nba we focused on some patron
now watch that black boy fly

black boy fly
watch that black boy fly
black boy fly
watch that black boy fly
black boy fly
watch that black boy fly
black boy

i used to jealous of jayceon
i used to jealous of jayceon - taylor when i was young
taylor made a career out of music from writing songs
a buick had driven past bumping him when i mowed the lawn
money laundering hustling homies pondering up against
schemes to make a million even if doing you harm
wars the case and just in case you wasnt alarmed
the city had fought with firearms and many had died before dawn
its 2004 and im hearing the people roar
for the name of the game they line in front of the store
swap meets selling our mixtapes im like oh shit wait
dont wanna be another nigga stuck regretting mistakes
mixed feelings was my opinion i was defending my insecurities
chillin my conscience next to a villain
compton made you believe success wasnt real
be honest none of us knew of a record deal
so as i peel through these lottery tickets
i see a harley davidson truck visit the same plaza we shopped
a tall nigga hopped out with jordans and a white tank top
he was top of the rap game we was the top of the block
so watch that black boy fly

black boy fly
watch that black boy fly
black boy fly
watch that black boy fly
black boy fly
watch that black boy fly
black boy

my mama didnt raise me up to be jealous-hearted
like most of the winners call it
regardless of where you stay hold your head and continue marching
thats what she said but in my head i wanted to be like jordan
a boy touring the country with money from mic recording
the only way out the ghetto you know the stereotype
shooting hoops or live on the stereo like top 40
and shortly i got discouraged
like every time i walked to the corner had them guns bursting
nigga i was rehearsing in repetition the phrase
only one in a million will ever see better days
especially when the crime waves was bigger than tsunamis
break your boogie boards to pieces you just a typical homy
all these niggas facetious and they all standing beside me
they all will buy me a chopper if any one of you try me
what am i to do when every neighborhood is an obstacle
when 2 niggas making it out had never sounded logical
3 niggas making it out thats mission impossible
so i never believed the type of performance that i could do
i wasnt jealous cuz of the talents they got
i was terrified theyll be the last black boys to fly
out of compton

thank god
black boy fly watch that black boy flywe on
aight
123 go

waking up in a dream
sleepwalking on another big stage
you never heard peace til you hear people scream
your name and your song im so far away
from the place i used to be struggling usually
look at the newer me fate pursuing me
i can feel the energy in the air
it feel like im supposed to be here

everywhere i go im getting so much love
fans the stars everyone
sayin how they cant wait for the lp
and im gonna blow
feel so good in what you do
helps somebody else get through
thats why i do the best i can
because i know how blessed i am

im so high i can touch the sky
i know its my time
and its now or never
im so bright i light the night
and it feels so right aint nothing better

a fool if i take it all for granted
a smart man if i keep my feet planted to the earth 
cuz the people that hurt can’t understand it
you speakin outlandish i’m ashamed how to make it all work
another planet it’s a short term role for me
i rec it’s all for me it’s just mo with me
and you’re here for you too here can re-persevere
defenses i yet feel relentless
ambition with a clear vision
takin off i ain’t takin off these pistons
i’m takin off on the enemies your distance
came across me how much it’d cost me to get you out my business
i said a planet is a shortterm goal no sky is the limit
i’m past that now pass that
a word not one but 4 times 2 plus yours

i see myself performing at
soldout shows where the room is packed
sitting at the grammys winning 5 awards
see myself on big billboards
climbing round the world would endorse me deals
can’t imagine how it feels
that’s why i’m smiling every day
cause my dream ain’t far away

im so high i can touch the sky
i know its my time
and its now or never
im so bright i light the night
and it feels so right aint nothing better

you’re looking at me and tell me i’m blessed
calculating my steps my heart my breath
breath lungs of a victory and vividly you see me when i’m at my best my worse
this verse is dedicated to the days that i slept with the curse
research my paid dues i’m reimbursed
i burst in the crowd with a voice and a crown
i’m a king on a prowl and i see mama smile
and the vow i’mma take that i’ll never break
you can break bread with me now we can all take a bow
on the edge of the pedestal and scream out loud
that we made it off the avenue i walk then down in the darkness
i often sit back and get lost in the rap that i root 
when you told me that it spoke to your soul
i was talkin to you i was walkin it through
heavy ghetto tail of success hello

and i’m so happy i cry
cause i can’t believe
all the things i ever wanted
are finally happening for me
and it’s so surreal
that i almost feel
that any minute i can wake up
from this fantasy
when you play so hard

kendricks childhood imaginary friend thats right

and id like to welcome you to good kid maad city
so grab your cartoons and cereal

and sing along

when we grow up we gon go and get us some money
spend it all in front of the county building
blow it like coltrane blow it like coltrane
when we grow up we gon go and get us some money
spend it all in front of the county building
blow it like coltrane blow it like coltrane

kendrick you remember that one time when we was…
ive been waiting on this since dr dre and pac
was on rosecrans in that burgerstand at 95
people staring at em in amazement
reservation at the days inn
we was living out a hotel at the time
breakfast lunch and dinner chicken from kentucky fried
mama babysitting section 8 vouchers the move
when nothing else to lose but a burger flip and job
close my eyes inside the swap meet and imagine this imagine
gold ballroom ak-47 dancing
howling at the moon whats a pack of hungry babies
hope you feed em soon bite your back you die of rabies
everyday we pray to eat at the table at sizzlers
but never make the visit if better days was on its way
then they make the decision to make the wrong turn
so for now we heat this skillet so this canned food can burn
oh i remember that it was the ravioli with the hot sauce in it right

and all the ghetto children in the world say thats my car
all the ghetto boys say thats my car
all the ghetto girls say thats my car
when we grow up when we grow up
all the ghetto children in the world say thats my car
all the ghetto boys say thats my car
all the ghetto girls say thats my car
when we grow up when we grow up

nigga you remember the smoke and the burning buildings and shit
couples stolen tvs and a seat belt for my safety
played the passenger i think its five years after eighty
seven do the math  92 dont you be lazy
looking out the window notice all the essentials
of a block party that stop for a second then it rekindle
like a flame from a trick candle everybody got dental
insurance cause we bout to floss you get that couch i sent you
i heard that from a block away probably had a credentials
of a scholar but shit not today them dayton spokes was his to take
refrigerators barbecue pits and jordan kicks
they did invasions while helicopters recorded it
hello mi-mister miyagi i want them ten woo-woofers
say that you got me if not ill dig in your drawer for it
the swap meet was the bulls-eye like tauruses
murder was the melody you should know what the chorus is
papa you really telling me we can just get some more of it
if we run out he said lil nigga today the poor is rich
dont tell your mom that you seen a molotov bomb
if she ask just know you have to lie and son dont forget
bitches aint shit hoes aint neither
niggas gon snitch watch the company you keeping
and one day youll put money in the ghetto when you got it
rather than having to hustle all these rodney king riots
thats right the mothafuckin rodney king
you just put your daddy on  roadboris gardiner
every nigger is a star
every nigger is a star
every nigger is a star
every nigger is a star

who will deny that you and i and
every nigger is a star

life can be like a box of chocolate
quid pro quo somethin for somethin thats the obvious
oh shit flows so sick dont you swallow it
bitin my style youre salmonella poison positive
i can just alleviate the rap industry politics
milk the game up never lactose intolerant
the last remainder of real shit you know the obvious

be all you can be true but the problem is
a dreams only a dream if work dont follow it
remind me of the homies that used to know me now follow this
ill tell you my hypothesis im probably just way too loyal
k dizzle would do it for you my niggas think im a god
truthfully all of em spoiled usually youre never charged
but somethin came over you once i took you to the fuckin bet awards

somebody told me you thinkin bout snatchin jewelry
i shouldve listened what my grandmama said to me

oh now slow down

snoop dogg
and once upon a time in a city so divine
called west side compton there stood a little nigga
he was 5 foot something dazed and confused
talented but still under the neighborhood ruse
you can take your boy out the hood but you cant take the hood out the homie
took his show money stashed it in the mozey wozey
hollywoods nervous
fuck you goodnight thank you much for your servicei remember you was conflicted misusing your influence
sometimes i did the same

if these walls could talk
if these walls could talk
if these walls could talk
if these walls could talk
if these walls could talk
if these walls could talk

sex she just want to close her eyes and sway
if you if you if you exercise your right to work it out
its true its true its true shout out to the birthday girls say hey
say hey everyone deserves a night to play
and shes plays only when you tell her no

if these walls could talk
i can feel your reign when it cries gold lives inside of you
if these walls could talk
i love it when i’m in it i love it when i’m in it

if these walls could talk they’d tell me to swim good
no boat i float better than he would
no life jacket i’m not the guard in nazareth
but your flood can be misunderstood
wall telling me they full of pain resentment
need someone to live in them just to relieve tension
me i’m just a tenant
my lord said these walls vacant more than a minute
these walls are vulnerable exclamation
interior pink color coordinated
i interrogated every nook and cranny
i mean its still amazing before they couldn’t stand me
these walls want to cry tears
these walls happier when i’m here
these walls never could hold up
everytime i come around demolition might crush

if these walls could talk
i can feel your reign when it cries gold lives inside of you
if these walls could talk
i love it when i’m in it i love it when i’m in it

if these walls could talk they’d tell me to go deep
yelling at me continuously i can see
your defense mechanism is my decision
knock these walls down that’s my religion
walls feeling like they ready to close in
i suffocate then catch my second wind
i resonate in these walls
i don’t know how long i can wait in these walls
i’ve been on these streets too long looking at you from the outside in
they sing the same old song about how they walls are always the cleanest
i beg to differ i must’ve missed them
i’m not involved i’d rather diss them
i’d rather call all you put your wall up
cause when i come around demolition gon’ crush

if these walls could talk
i can feel your reign when it cries gold lives inside of you
if these walls could talk
i love it when i’m in it i love it when i’m in it

if your walls could talk they’d tell you it’s too late
your destiny accepted your fate
burn accessories and stash them where they are
take the recipe the bible and god
wall telling you that commissary is low
race wars happening no calling co
no calling your mother to save you
homies say to you youre reputable not acceptable
your behavior is sammy da bull like a killer that turned snitch
walls is telling me you a bitch
you pray for appeals hoping the warden could afford them
that sentence so important
walls telling you to listen to sing about me
retaliation is strong you even dream about me
killed my homeboy and god spared your life
dumb criminal got indicted the same night
so when you play this song rewind the first verse
about me abusing my power so you can hurt
about me and her in the shower whenever she horny
about me and her in the after hours of the morning
about her baby daddy currently serving life
and how she think about you until we meet up at night
about the only girl that cared about you when you asked her
and how she fucking on a famous rapper
walls could talk

i remember you was conflicted
misusing your influence
sometimes i did the same
abusing my power full of resentment
resentment that turned into a deep depression
found myself screaming in a hotel roomloving you is complicated
loving you is complicated
loving you is complicated
loving you is complicated

loving you is complicated
loving you is complicated
loving you is complicated
loving you is complicated

i place blame when you steal

little brother you promised you’d watch him before they shot him
where was your antennas on the road bottles and bitches

this feelin is unmatched
this feelin is brought to you by adrenaline and good rap
black pendleton ball cap
west west west
we dont share the same synonym fall back
west west west
been in it before internet had new acts
mimicking radios nemesis may be wack
my innocence limited the experience lacked
ten of us with no tentative tactic that cracked
the mind of a literate writer but i did it in fact
you admitted it once i submitted it wrapped in plastic
remember scribblin scratchin diligent sentences backwards
visiting freestyle cyphers for your reaction
now i can live in a stadium pack it the fastest
gamblin benjamin benefits sittin in traffic
spinnin women in cartwheels linen fabric on fashion
winnin in every decision
kendrick is master and mastered it
isnt it lovely how menace has turned attraction
pivotin rappers finish your fraction while writing blue magic
thank god for rap i would say it got me a plaque
but whats better than that
the fact it brought me back home

we been waitin for you
waitin for you
waitin for you
waitin for you

i know everything i know myself

i know wisdom i know bad religion i know good karma
i know everything i know history
i know the universe works mentally
i know the perks of bullshit isnt meant for me
i know everything i know cars clothes hoes and money
i know loyalty i know respect i know those thats ornery
i know everything the highs to lows to groupies and junkies
i know if im generous at heart i dont need recognition
the way im rewarded well thats gods decision
i know you know that lines from compton school district

not to ever forget until i realized i didn’t know shit
the day i came home

we been waitin for you
waitin for you
waitin for you
waitin for you

i met a little boy that resembled my features
nappy afro gap in his smile
hand me down sneakers bounced through the crowd
runnin home and the man and woman that crossed him
sun beamin on his beady beads exhausted
tossin footballs with his ashy black ankles
breakin new laws mama passed on home trainin
he looked at me and said kendrick you do know my language
you just forgot because of what public schools had painted
oh i forgot dont kill my vibe thats right youre famous
i used to watch on channel 5 tv was takin
but never mind youre here right now dont you mistake it
its just a new trip take a glimpse at your familys ancestor
make a new list of everything you thought was progress
and that was bullshit i mean your life is full of turmoil
you spoiled by fantasies of who you are
i feel bad for you
i can attempt to enlighten you without frightenin you
if you resist ill back off quick go catch a flight or two
but if you pick destiny over rest in peace
than be an advocate go tell your homies especially
to come back home

y’all priorities are fucked up put energy in wrong shit
hennessy and crown vic my memory been gone since
don’t ask about no camera back at award shows
no don’t ask about my bitch no don’t ask about my foes
less you askin me about power yeah i got a lot of it
i’m the only nigga next to snoop that can push the button
had the coast on standby
“k dot what up i heard they opened up pandora’s box”
i box ‘em all in by a landslide
nah homie we too sensitive it spill out to the streets
i make the call and get the coast involved then history repeats
but i resolved inside that private hall while sitting down with jay
he said its funny how one verse could fuck up the game

i remember you was conflicted
misusing your influence
sometimes i did the same
abusing my power full of resentment
resentment that turned into a deep depression
found myself screaming in a hotel room
i didnt want to self-destruct
the evils of lucy was all around me
so i went running for answers
until i came home
but that didnt stop survivors guilt
going back and forth
trying to convince my self the stripes i earned
or maybe how a-1 my foundation was
but while my loved ones was fighting
a continuous war back in the city
i was entering a new onehow much a dollar really cost
the question is detrimental paralyzin my thoughts
parasites in my stomach keep me with a good feeling yall
gotta see how i’m chillin once i park this luxury car
hopping out feeling big as mutombo
20 on pump six dirty marcellus called me dumbo
20 years ago cant forget
now i can lend all my ear or two how to stack these residuals
tenfold the liberal concept of what menll do
20 on 6 he didnt hear me
indigenous african only spoke zulu
my american tongue was slurry
walked out the gas station
a homeless man with a silly tan complexion
asked me for ten grand
stressin about dry land
deep water powder blue skies that crack open
a piece of crack that he wanted i knew he was smokin
he begged and pleaded
asked me to feed him twice i didnt believe it
told him beat it
contributin money just for his pipe i couldnt see it
he said my son temptation is one thing that ive defeated
listen to me i want a single bill from you
nothin less nothin more
i told him i aint have it and closed my door
tell me how much a dollar cost

its more to feed your mind
water sun and love the one you love
all you need the air you breathe

hes starin at me in disbelief
my temper is buildin hes starin at me i grab my key
hes starin at me i started my car and tried to leave
and somethin told me to keep it in park until i could see
a reason why he was mad at a stranger like i was supposed to save him
like im the reason hes homeless and askin me for a favor
hes starin at me his eyes followed me with no laser
hes starin at me i notice that his stare is contagious
cause now im starin back at him feelin some type of disrespect
if i could throw a bat at him itd be aimin at his neck
i never understood someone beggin for goods
askin for handouts takin it if they could
and this particular person just had it down pat
starin at me for the longest until he finally asked
have you ever opened to exodus 14
a humble man is all that we ever need
tell me how much a dollar cost

its more to feed your mind
water sun and love the one you love
all you need the air you breathe

guilt trippin and feelin resentment
i never met a transient that demanded attention
they got me frustrated indecisive and power trippin
sour emotions got me lookin at the universe different
i should distance myself i should keep it relentless
my selfishness is what got me here who the fuck im kiddin
so ima tell you like i told the last bum crumbs and pennies
i need all of mines and i recognize this type of panhandlin all the time
i got better judgement i know when niggas hustlin
keep in mind when i was strugglin i did compromise
now i comprehend i smell grandpas old medicine
reekin from your skin moonshine and gin
nigga your babblin your words aint flatterin im imaginin
denzel be lookin at oneal
cause now im in sad thrills your gimmick is mediocre the jig is up
i seen you from a mile away losin focus
and im insensitive and i lack empathy
you looked at me and said your potential is bittersweet
i looked at him and said every nickel is mines to keep
he looked at me and said know the truth itll set you free
youre lookin at the messiah the son of jehova the higher power
the choir that spoke the word the holy spirit the nerve
of nazareth and ill tell you just how much a dollar cost
the price of having a spot in heaven embrace your loss i am god

i wash my hands i said my grace what more do you want from me
tears of a clown guess im not all what is meant to be
shades of grey will never change if i condone
turn this page help me change so right my wrongscomplexion two-step

and frame of mind for them bustas ain’t talkin’ “woohah”

and a gun in the hood and a mob of police
and a rock on the corner and a line full of fiends
and a bottle full of lean and a model on a scheme yup
these days of frustration keep yall on tuck and rotation
i duck these gold faces post up fee-fi-fo-fum basis
dreams of realities peace
blow steam in the face of the beast
the sky can fall down the wind can cry now

the world is a ghetto with big guns and picket signs
i love myself
but it can do what it want whenever it wants and i don’t mind
i love myself

and if you riding with me nigga let me ask this question nigga

i remember you was conflicted
misusing your influence
sometimes i did the same
abusing my power full of resentment
resentment that turned into a deep depression
found myself screaming in the hotel room
i didnt wanna self destruct
the evils of lucy was all around me
so i went running for answers
until i came home
but that didnt stop survivors guilt
going back and forth trying to convince myself the stripes i earned
or maybe how a-1 my foundation was
but while my loved ones was fighting the continuous war back in the city i was entering a new one
a war that was based on apartheid and discrimination
made me wanna go back to the city and tell the homies what i learned
the word was respect
just because you wore a different gang color than mines
doesnt mean i cant respect you as a black man
forgetting all the pain and hurt we caused each other in these streets
if i respect you we unify and stop the enemy from killing us
but i dont know im no mortal man maybe im just another nigga

shit and thats all i wrote
i was gonna call it another nigga but it aint really a poem i just felt like its something you probably could relate to
other than that now that i finally got a chance to holla at you i always wanted to ask you about a certain situa-
about a metaphor actually uh you spoke on the ground
what you mean bout that what the ground represent

tupac shakur &amp; kendrick lamar
the ground is gonna open up and swallow the evil
right
thats how i see it my word is bond
i see and the ground is the symbol for the poor people right the poor people is gonna open up this whole world and swallow up the rich people
cause the rich people gonna be so fat they gonna be so appetising you know what im saying wealthy appetizing
the poor gonna be so poor and hungry you know what im saying its gonna be like
there might be some cannibalism out this mutha they might eat the rich

kendrick lamar
aight so let me ask you this then
do you see yourself as somebody thats rich or somebody that made the best of they own opportunities

tupac shakur
i see myself as a natural born hustler a true hustler in every sense of the word
i took nothin i took the opportunities i worked at the most menial and degrading job and built myself up so i could get it to where i owned it
i went from having somebody manage me to me hiring the person that works my management company
i changed everything i realised my destiny in a matter of five years you know what im saying i made myself a millionaire
i made millions for a lot of people now its time to make millions for myself you know what im saying
i made millions for the record companies i made millions for these movie companies now i make millions for us

kendrick lamar
and through your different avenues of success how would you say you managed to keep a level of sanity

tupac shakur
by my faith in god by my faith in the game and by my faith in all good things come to those that stay true
you know what im saying and it was happening to me for a reason you know what im saying i was noticing shit i was punching the right buttons and it was happening
so its no problem you know i mean it’s a problem but im not finna let them know
im finna go straight through

kendrick lamar
would you consider yourself a fighter at heart or somebody that heh somebody that only reacts when they back is against the wall

tupac shakur
shit i like to think that at every opportunity ive ever been threatened with resistance its been met with resistance
and not only me but it goes down my family tree
you know what im saying its in my veins to fight back

kendrick lamar
aight well how long you think it take before niggas be like we fighting a war im fighting a war i cant win and i wanna lay it all down

tupac shakur
in this country a black man only have like five years we can exhibit maximum strength and thats right now while you a teenager while you still strong or while you still wanna lift weights while you still wanna shoot back
cause once you turn 30 its like they take the heart and soul out of a man out of a black man in this country
and you dont wanna fight no more
and if you dont believe me you can look around you dont see no loud mouth 30-year old muthafuckas

kendrick lamar
thats crazy because me being one of your offspring of the legacy you left behind i can truly tell you that theres nothing but turmoil goin on so i wanted to ask you what you think is the future for me and my generation today

tupac shakur
i think that niggas is tired of grabbin shit out the stores and next time its a riot theres gonna be like uh bloodshed for real
i dont think america know that
i think american think we was just playing and its gonna be some more playing but it aint gonna be no playing
it’s gonna be murder you know what im saying its gonna be like nat turner 1831 up in this muthafucka
you know what im saying its gonna happen

kendrick lamar
thats crazy man
in my opinion only hope that we kinda have left is music and vibrations lotta people don’t understand how important it is
sometimes i be like get behind a mic and i dont know what type of energy imma push out or where it comes from
trip me out sometimes

tupac shakur
because the spirits we aint even really rappin we just letting our dead homies tell stories for us

kendrick lamar
damn

i wanted to read one last thing to you
its actually something a good friend had wrote describing my world
it says

the caterpillar is a prisoner to the streets that conceived it
its only job is to eat or consume everything around it in order to protect itself from this mad city
while consuming its environment the caterpillar begins to notice ways to survive
one thing it noticed is how much the world shuns him but praises the butterfly
the butterfly represents the talent the thoughtfulness and the beauty within the caterpillar
but having a harsh outlook on life the caterpillar sees the butterfly as weak and figures out a way to pimp it to his own benefits
already surrounded by this mad city the caterpillar goes to work on the cocoon which institutionalizes him
he can no longer see past his own thoughts
hes trapped
when trapped inside these walls certain ideas start to take roots such as going home and bringing back new concepts to this mad city
the result
wings begin to emerge breaking the cycle of feeling stagnant
finally free the butterfly sheds light on situations that the caterpillar never considered ending the internal struggle
although the butterfly and caterpillar are completely different they are one and the same

whats your perspective on that
