if you kill it no more standin on that corner like a stop sign
everytime you spotted they call it shot time
not at the gym but in the grim reapers hands
you important if a bullet hits injure your plans
this is not an adventure but a full-time duty
if you seen how niggaz hit the club they pullin out uzis

aftermath presents nigga with a attitude  volume 1
rap critics politicin
wanna know the outcome
ready to die reasonable doubt and doggystyle in one
i feel like pac after the snoop dogg trial was done
dre behind that g-series and all eyez on me
i watched the death of a dynasty
so i told vibe magazine
workin with drdre was a dream
i had visions of makin a classic
then my world turned black like i was starin outta stevie wonders glasses
its kinda hard to imagine like kanye west
comin back from his fatal accident to beat makin and rappin but
we da future
whitney houston told me that its gon take more than a bullet in the heart to hold me back

hook

verse 2

i had dreams of fuckin an rnb bitch like mya
when i saw that ass on the front of that king
read the article in the magazine
she loved gangstas loved nasty things
so im in the glass house havin nasty dreams
good girls never give it up
but anything is possible if 50 fucked vivica
hurdled lifes obstacles found my way through the maze
then joy turned to pain like frankie beverly and maze
used to dream of bein unsigned hype
till i was crushed my dave mays almost let my pen fall asleep on the page
daydreamin yesterday
dozin off back-stage
i tought i saw eazy talkin to jam master jay
so i walked over heard jam master say
its a hard-knock life then you pass away
they say sleep is the cousin of death
sow my eyes wide open cuz a dream is kin to your last breath

dont sleep on me homie i bring nightmares to reality
rap phenomenon defyin the rules of gravity
studied all the classic started revisin my strategy
cuz marshall mathers made it
curtis jackson made it
head in the clouds wonderin where the hell marvin gaye went
how do i say this im livin for my son but i cant figure out why im at my temple with this gun
wake up to a jesus piece like a catholic nun
the war to be a rap legend ha just begun

the game
i was born in the slums struggled from day one
ray charles vision blinded by the light from the sun
no navigation no sense of direction darker complexion
made it hard to live; dad how you fathered your kids
stranded on the highway of life left us out to die left us out to dry
shhhh im still here my mothers cries
nigga no father figures make harder niggaz
through the years went to war with niggaz from what i saw in the picture
now your son is bigger 13 but just like you
moms said i would grow up and be just like you
from what you did to my sister she disliked you
sixteen eleventh grade look at me just like you
gunnin for riches runnin hoppin project fences
street corners to arizona how i earn my digits
and im far from finished gamin til my coffee diminish
why pray for the afterlife when mines just beginnin huh

the game
only son by our mother no brothers only sisters by this one
every time i kissed one i missed one let me explain
eight years before the game everything came with pain
watch the fate of my family slain would never see good times a-gayn
cursed with pain by a nigga with no shame
my father that have the same name as his father
my grandfather wouldnt believe he pulled up our family tree
i can see him rollin over in his coffin
im left with often thoughts of how could you molest your daughter
they say thats ten times worse than manslaughter
man you oughta be dead in a grave
but it wasnt my call so instead you sat in a cage
high-powered two-hundred and fifty pound six-five coward
woulda been dead in an hour
heard you was scared to take a shower scared of the yard
your end is near you shoulda been scared of god motherfucker

the game

into lawn chairs and green grass in your yard
im tryin to watch my kids wrestlin yours

havin a child is like a blessing from god
you just gotta work hard cant let your youngest star strip in that bar
i feel your pain this shit is rippin my heart
but where and when do we start listen to the voice in back of my mind

from what you did to my sister she disliked you
sixteen eleventh grade look at me just like you
gunnin for riches runnin hoppin project fences
street corners to arizona how i earn my digits
and im far from finished gamin til my coffee diminish
why pray for the afterlife when mines just beginnin huh

the game
only son by our mother no brothers only sisters by this one
every time i kissed one i missed one let me explain
eight years before the game everything came with pain
watch the fate of my family slain would never see good times a-gayn
cursed with pain by a nigga with no shame
my father that have the same name as his father
my grandfather wouldnt believe he pulled up our family tree
i can see him rollin over in his coffin
im left with often thoughts of how could you molest your daughter
they say thats ten times worse than manslaughter
man you oughta be dead in a grave
but it wasnt my call so instead you sat in a cage
high-powered two-hundred and fifty pound six-five coward
woulda been dead in an hour
heard you was scared to take a shower scared of the yard
your end is near you shoulda been scared of god motherfucker[the game]

seen hell came back and here comes my first classic
still chop it up at the table still put dope in the bag
and still got dope under the mattress
it was hustle before rappin nuttin before that and
12 years old a lost soul bumpin illmatic
gunshots tried and almost took the young kids live
cant do it i been through it the young kid survived
got the ghetto on my shoulder homey its gon be a long ride
bear with me ima take you there with me
show you how the sun shine in one rhyme no more stormy weather
streets is mine we gon live forever
get it together pac is watchin big is listenin
eazy is talkin to us big pun is witnessin
while they souls still glistenin in ghettos from compton to brooklyn
the shells cry every hoods anthem
where everybody goes to church and prayers are never answered
and they throwin us curveballs but we hank aarons
a picture with no canvas streets are so skanless
younguns jump rope play ball with fiends and dope handlers
teenage mothers deadbeat fathers no families
lost and often runaway or live with grandparents
life stories with no authors see it through {} robinsons cubicles
when time life is so beautiful
walk with me we can make it if we try lost soldiers sometimes
we gotta die but its okay to cry
mothers strugglin tryin to survive reach out grab my hand
i gotcha wont let you go for nuttin i promise
praises due to elijah muhammad peace be unto farad muhammad
words of minister farrakhan
been true be loyal know your roots water your soil
stop fightin amongst ourself from birth we royal
whos king we fightin over a crown while lifeguards
watch the hopes and dreams of kids and young teens drown
more infants bein born with aids more parents mournin graves
the plot thickens somebody show us the way
tears crackin the pavement streets breakin up
the thrill is gone and its a long walk home
so we might as well start runnin if its there gotta take it
member jada said we gon make it
and it shouldnt take 9/11 to bring our minds together
shit rough well grind together
light a candle we can shine forever or i can pass
so i wont miss aaliyahs concert in heaven
live life while we listen to my old heads
so i glow like the memory of lisa left eye lopez
through a six-seven brougham ride with me through the hood mayne
where street lights flicker and chuck taylors hang
and nobody know they neighbors name less they sell weed or cocaine
a lot of black clouds on a block but no rain
and game got a lot to say so they wanna take me down
in my own front yard like marvin gaye
cant do it by myself people need help
keep on tryin to live healthy til the end of my days
and when i die wont lead my daughter astray lookin from heaven
watch my people drive my coffin through the compton parade

verse two
im in the city where its strange where killers follow direction
and trail witness protection to get a shot at they brain
where the babies carry semis and swallow pills for power
count paper for pollyn penny-pinch for hours
take sacks from cowards when the streets is watchin
tuck guns in trunks cause real gs is boxin
aint no other options if you stand on your own two
and if you came to battle you can stand in the phone booth
cause we dont wear capes in this part of the land
cause every youngster from my block has been a part of the plan
ive been trainin since eighty-seven and famous since eighty-nine
teaching came from the nation my spirit is from divine
when i pass the word through these raps on beats
its fosho that the lord gon make the whole track speak
to the streets when i pass these beats
its fosho that the lord gon make the whole track speak
to the streets yknahmtalkinbout people
make the track speak truth rap get it right
truth rap mayne for the people get it right truth rapchorus

the fire in him made it difficult to talk to the n*igga
most of the time i let him know i dont agree with what he do
but he a hard-head dre thats why im talkin to you
see when i first met my nigga son was laying in the cut
type reserved homie was quiet and kept his mouth shut
until you told him to spit for me he flippin from the gut
i dug his spirit and i thought the dude was talented as f**k
and as time went on and he was working with the finest
i saw the pressure start to build so i gave additional guidance
you gave him something that could make or break a nigga you should face it
so big i dont even think he was ready to embrace it
with the potential to be a strong nigga with conviction
the only problem was our little nigga woulnt listen
but when doc say its a wrap its a rap 
its still aftermath and aint nuttin after that

chorus

once upon a time in the projects yo
i watched my uncle greg put ds on his six-fo
i washed it on monday so he bought me a gold chain
shopped crack and watched colors and i soaked up game
drove the impala on his lap that was my role model
used to let me kill the corner of his 40-ounce bottle
on the weekend him and my pops flashed the vette
til one weekend my uncle got stabbed to death
he got murdered by a fiend my pops aint like that
he was from nutty block they used to call him maniac
crazy ass n**** wit a black panther tat

let me collect the 40-ounce bottles in the dope spot
bought my first converse thought i couldnt be stopped

when i creased up my khakis and threw on my ronnie lott
used to think that i was hard so i stole my brothers glock
and thats the day my life changed cause that night he got shot
killed by another crip over his rolex watch
i got high for three years off that chronic from the doc
i was drinkin 40-ounces a lot
and every liquor store in compton sold out the day eazy dropped

but i never left fingerprints on my

chorus

verse 3
i got a lot of dead homies some blood some crip

i went to twenty funerals by the age of ninteen
then i went to college basketball was my dream

he showed me how to turn a stolen 50 into a brick
bought a cadillac thought i was rich bangin dj quik
on crenshaw got jacked for my shit
took a long chronic hit and thought about the time
when i was 12 years old and i emptied my first clip
hit my first switch same night f**ked my first bitch

she caught a stray bullet ridin shotgun in my shit
so i got her name tatted in

im from the city that made you motherfuckers afraid of suge
made my grandmother pray for good
it never made her happy but i bet that new mercedes could
aint no bars but niggas cant escape the hood
they took so many of my niggas that i should hate the hood
but its real niggas like me that make the hood

cuz we dodgers and impalas with the windows tinted
i duck shots where venus and sarena used to play tennis
and they never came back like throwin a boomerang flat

niggas roll up on you now you stuck in that harold and cane trap
if you slippin in hollywood and you get your chain snatched
i know some niggas that know some niggas ill get your chain back

[chorus]

banging was the blueprint money was the master plan
duffel bank full of grants and franklins

head to the barbershop to get chopped up
hearing war stories who dead and who locked up

no cleanup hitter so i was stranded on second base
i had to steal third motherfucker thats my word
theres some queens niggas tryna put me back on the curb
i was ultimate warrior to you bully ass niggas
i will come through the hood with the fully axe niggas

pipes the indians used to like we called it chief right
stepping on the leafs right to reach heights

to the nature spot to taste the flavors they got
my eyes drop i like it alot yeah an angel

th-the way that i rhyme loc is mine
like the first time you heard mary j and you were standing in line
to purchase tickets to see her blow like chicago wind
and im ridin with common looking for chicago zen
and like chicago winds i was once a street disciple
rockin every jordan shoe nike put out by michael
that made me feel like i could fly sometimes i wanted to die
prolly cuz the angel dust was fuckin with my third eye
so i start hip hop and i understand why common used to love her
she got me open so i even had had
but i used the rubber cuz she was married to rakim
so i bought me a gold chain pretendin that i was him
so i can get close to the girl i loved the most
but she left cali and went on tour with ne-yo and ghost
big gave her one more chance and she took big down
i shouldve knew it shot g and pac told ya she get around

chorus

verse 3 - the game

from the city of lost souls impalas and polished gold
between the car and the rims we got alot of chrome

coincidentally on ya birthdays
i ditched the class
cause the younger me dumber me
was chasin the cash
chasin the ass
lowlife with his face in the grass

ridin home from school
in front of the bus
not even thinkin bout how
rosa parks done it for us
how she stayed behind bars
and she done it for us
and she stayed behind bars
till she won it for us

sometimes i wanna give up
or at least take a break
thats when i close my eyes
and see coretta scotts face x2

word up game

standin at the pu
panoramic view of the seating
greeting
ive been meanin
to do me some letter readin
to the king he forever breathin

while his momma cleanin up the kitchen
same cotton in white tees

if dr king marched today would bill gates march
i know obama would
but would hillary take part

great minds think great thoughts
the pictures i paint
make the mona lisa look like fake art

i feel the pain of nelson mandella
because when it rains it pours
i need rihannas umbrella
for coretta scotts tear drops
when she got the phone call that
the future just took a fuckin headshot

i wonder why jesse jackson didnt catch em
before his body drop

hit the freeway and see how fast the aston go
roll the window down clip off the ashes so
you can see all my diamonds and how much cash i blow
how many bitches i fuck how many cars i drive
how many goons i got count em and they all outside
niggas try to shut me up like malcom
but standin in the window caine smoking was the outcome
sometimes i get a little stressed and pop a valium
hit hollywood late night and knock down a stallion
so niggas think twice about my medallion or
youll hear cuba gooding yelling ricky 
my nostalgia is one hundred percent compton and zero percent snitch
park a bentley and the phantom on blocks while i use the bitch
made the cincinnati fitted more famous than griffey did
and just to think several years ago they tried to split his wig
two to the chest struck his heart one hit his rib
then i blacked out like a movie all i could hear

[verse 2]
feelin all fucked up woke up to a doctor
all i could think about was that the cops took my weed and my choppers
they want me to sing like sinatra i told the detective

i seen boyz in the hood morris chestnut was a actor
2pac was the real life ricky 
then they shot down the nigga that shot him i swear to god

then my grandmother house went up for auction
and thats what tipped [] im goin back to buy the block then
too many niggas locked in dig up cochran and defend all my niggas
with they faith under stockings rather face god then 25 with no options
if compton aint the murder capital we in the top ten
drive by with our face painted like a clown
with a tre-pound forty shells bouncin off the ground

with no key in the ignition
whered you get this clyde

walked out the store looked left oh no
ran back in the store here comes the 5-0
so i ran real quick made a move to the back
and knocked a cute bitch into a polo rack
said sorry jumped over her and fled to the back door
then i kicked the shit open you wont believe who i saw
its chris in handcuffs pointin at me
and the cops made him chase me before they let him free
one cop tried to grab me and the other one missed
i got away with more time and they both got pissed
ran straight out the mall spotted this blue coupe
dogg pound on the plates thats gotta be snoop
so i ran up the car and said yo snoop
the cops got me on the run need a ride 
hell yeah bigg snoop little homie hop in

and if that means ill lose you on twitter than so be it

her baby in the projects im supposed to be proud of compton

back when michael jordan was raw
92 was the year my city was city of god
coke on the boulevard crack fiends skiing the slaloms
is exactly how drug lords found their way from the bottom
them yeezys drop got em couldnt afford em you shot em
cause they the same price as fucking red bottoms
we dont pop tags leave that motherfucker on it
return it back to the store when you no longer want it
sleep outside for days for a pair of js
then you sleep outside forever cause you got sprayed
if you gon die for em they better be some number 4s
or some shit made in japan you can never find in the stores
rolex watches gucci belts and louis luggage
definitely set us apart from niggas when we in public
jeffery campbell and michael kors got you looking rugged
gave her a louis bag now she love me
take a look at her posin on my car cause

verse 2

trynna save her ass like trynna save a stripper
she fine as fuck you trynna fuck thats the reason you tip her
and all im sayin is a watch and a gold chain
cant make bobby valentino johnny coltrane
and she knows this thats why her mouth wide
openin up her legs straight up like they suicide
i cross my heart and hope to die
if something happens to my voice and can no longer provide
should i run and hide no hustle and survive
workin 9 to 5 until sweat drips into my eyes
and if it burns like the kush then i go back to sellin pies
switchin lanes in that cutlass rubbin her thighs while i drive
reminiscin on the days i was rollin broke
jesus piece on the rearview holy ghost
amen
