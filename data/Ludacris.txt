when organized drop the tracks then start duckin
when ludacris get in the bed start fuckin

and lemme tell yall the truth we kick down doors
save all the h20 for front rows
live in the bank and watch for stank hoes

light skinded nigga turn red but get green
inhale some of that dro but blow steam
love a combination big ass and tight jeans

[chorus]

[verse 2]
[girl] boy you done lost yo mind
no ive lost my virginity
and i shot quick like that fool shot kennedy
whats the remedy hennessey coke
if you cut all your money youd still be half broke
ashes to ashes smoke or get smoked
we come by the masses you come and get choked
if you take me for a fool ill take you for a joke
tired of fast food so they cooked up dope
so now we eatin lobster shrimp and things
and watch for imposters thats been in the game
we invented the game and yall just got hip
[dude] man whats that smell
probably yo upper lip
cause i love to walk around like my shit dont stank
even if its cigars and that purple color dank
chillin in the gump with no trace of tom hanks
so put this in yo jaw like weiners and beef franks

[chorus]

[verse 3]
i put too much sugar in my koolaid
and party like a kid wit a high top fade
arrive to a show and i like to get paid
arrive to a hoe and i like to get laid
ride up on my back like rugs and floormats
im on the right page but whats my format
i wave to the ocean cause im where shores at
and women go nuts just like my bozack
did you know that man im the gift of change
electric stoves so give me the keys to the range
shagadelic beautiful but strange
went to magic city saw nikki and blue flames
rearrange same broad different night
pass the e&amp;j and let a nigga get right
the bomb threaten dude thats on yo same flight
the highlights that i live a high ass life

my tribes on more quests than midnight marauders
its all piña coladas no cops and robbers
takin trips back and forth from here to the bahamas

i hump more than llamas get rolled more than tires
if you say im not nice then your a motherfuckin liar
entitled to your opinions into the next millennium
so many major coins that i thought i had a million

while im hittin trees harder than sonny bono
double dragon mixed up with an abobo
i kill villains in slowmo for talkin crazy in my dojo
got nothin to lose like im a boxcar hobo
when i get ludacris with bridges on the promo
niggaz wanna clown im homey and bozo
cause in the grand prize game my life callin like jo-jo

[chimere]
ooh hey yeah
do you know how to leave rideride

[verse 1]
ya see it started off in st paul from the street of old nash
and it feels so good to escape and just kick it and laugh
my clan had to bring the ruckus cause we had the cream
all you can eat over at ryans or some fish at gaseens
and i had to fix a good bag and make decisions and haste
cause soul food aint the motherfuckin thang to waste
so lets get looney up on the set cause i got five on the fire
will slide to east point and make our way to black rirer
lookin like outkast on the spot smokin blunts and
hit the liquor store got up got out and got something
that eightball so i can do some space age pimpin
my blood stay young off 45s colt and chicken
camels and rolls filled with ds and vogues
and playas mackin them hoes in dyke clothes
comin up slammin caddy doors
in southwest well take it to yo chest
and we got it locked like some niggas on house arrest
cause we ridin

[chorus chimere]
ridin on that midnight train to georgia riiide
ridin on that midnight train to georgia riiide

[verse 2]
its just one of those days when i can kick it like this and like that
its a free day my folks got rowdy way back
i right off of cascade or ralph david abernathy
i shall proceed and continue to keep my roots nappy
cause afros in all seasons they keep me warm
some livin that thug life so how long will they mourn
i still ride thats why i bounce my way to bank-bed
im so bad that ill knock you out thats what my mama said
sippin on brandy sunny days with my best friends
today you see and then you cruise through the west end
they shouldve said it was six flags over georgia
then underground my tuesdays would be packed when i got older
if i told you one i told ya ass a thousand times
i got em all in check when it comes to bustin rhymes
dont sweat the technique cause i just move the crowd
my mobs deep of alcoholics people label us loud because we ride

[chorus]

[verse 3]
see i felt my bones jump as i crossed the road
i heard the squad was wiped up so i flipped my mode
on my way to d-e-c baby cant you see
that decatur is totally to b-i-g for thee
lost boyz ridin around in jeeps lex luths and beamers
yo cars get scooped just like regina carpet cleaners
its stone mountain cats puttin it down
they played kurupt so i just gave all my dogs a pound
now my conflict was crucial off some hay i smoked
i should be gettin it cause life is too got damn short
and now my minds playin tricks and my boys actin ghetto
back to the c-p i put the pedal to the metal
god bless the child thats just got his own
since i was a juvenile makin cash money at home
im from a boy to a man ive reached the end of my road
its ludacris signin off till the next episode lets ride

[chorus]

[verse 4]
cause its the a-t-l
where all the pimps and the playas just dwell
we get the cash and the ass then bail
we leave a trace but never leave a trail
say it again
where all the pimps and the playas just dwell
we get the cash and the ass then bail
we leave a trace but never leave a trail

its an everyday struggle 
trying to get out 
trying to get out 
trying to make it 
check this out nigga 
what 

chorus 
im stuck in between a rock and a hard place 
bad luck is what results from my paper chase 
i keep looking it aint no dough 
so i dont wanna look no mo what 
repeat 

i need to get away to another day or place in time 
and find where reality can ease my mind 
and shine on me like the sons of the earth 
for what its worth my turf is ruff and rugged so i gave birth 
to a dream where cream lies between 
all the dirt and the gravel so i battle to achieve my green 
and still try to move forward at a steady pace 
cause bad luck is interfering with my paper chase 
so i erase the crime lies and sad cries 
wit sore eyes and keep mines on the uprise 
but it dont work cause im steady getting jerked 
by my neighborhood up to no good where bad niggas lurk 
the urk me leaving effects thats too negative 
so ludacris is looking for a better place to live 
and i cant stand it its really got me buggin 
its like im in the war and i just keep on tuggin cause im 

chorus 

i try to find a way outta this maze 
its got me crazed im in a daze 
so many ways to boost into a different phase 
but i cant think i cant do nothing 
you think im fronting 
you hear me grunting 
lord you aint even saying nuttin 
i need some currency before theres an emergency 
forget crimes i wont let my mind get the best of me 
its not gone happen im trapped in two worlds 
on one side i see diamonds on the other i see pearls 
its a whirlwind disaster with two damn sides 
so im gone with the wind and come right back with the tide 
cause i keep my eyes on the skies and my head in the clouds 
and when my mouth is shut up it makes my thoughts get loud 
its like a crowd in a stadium 
mils i be craving em 
money making schemes locked up in my cranium 
cause i need outta this critical situation 
my minds in jail i dont know the time that its facing im 

chorus 

im sick of knockin im sick of clocking 
im sick of droppin in a hole never reaching my goal 
its got my soul seperated into pieces 
it just increases 
im hit wit anger like a cooked tit wit hot greases 
so if you understood my attitude 
maybe you feel what im feeling 
and then it start appealing 
to ya intellect and aspect of dreams and aspirations 
death by temptations even got my heart basting 
so im tracing the line where i can find a better path 
and make it last sit back and laugh before the aftermath 
the tragic flaw is what makes it raw 
so let it fall and ill get through it even if i have to crawl 
my way i see the sun and theres no delay 
and ima pray cause the lord will make a brighter day 
or will he keep me in his holding cell 
but enough wit the questions the only story to tell 
is that im

[chorus]

[verse 3]
i put too much sugar in my koolaid
and party like a kid wit a high top fade
arrive to a show and i like to get paid
arrive to a hoe and i like to get laid
ride up on my back like rugs and floormats
im on the right page but whats my format
i wave to the ocean cause im where shores at
and women go nuts just like my bozack
did you know that man im the gift of change
electric stoves so give me the keys to the range
shagadelic beautiful but strange
went to magic city saw nikki and blue flames

delete your first steps but ill save the last dance
i just bought some new guns my mama said it aint worth it
but im at the shooting range just cause practice makes perferct
bullseye i stunt growth and stop lives
you run with niggas thats more chicken then pot pies
bok bok bok im shakin your tale feathers
i got big balls im a sac king like chris webber
luda will take you back to duck hunt and double dribble
when niggas sold quarters and dimes and smoked nickels
my cars got big tvs and satellites
i got a wheel of fortune cause i flipped os like vanna white
and the servey says kill a mutha fucka now
could it be off with his head or shoot a mutha fucka down
ground round ground chuck your ground beef
bullets gather round then i shoot rounds around teeth

[chorus]

[verse three ludacris]
i kick niggas in theyre ass reboot em like laptops
and they wouldnt even box if i gave em a flat top
you punks pucker and pout bicker and babble
now they all lost for words like i beat em in scrabble
you see im from a small town called fresh out a cops ass
where mr head-potatoes are skinned they get mashed
i smell puss from fifty yards
yall not playin with full decks as if i jacked out ya jacks and left fifty cards
catch me in vegas spinnin the green
i re-up with more chips than a vending machine
then you can catch me in rome maggots in brauds and sticking em
and youll be at home picking your bougars and flicking em
a drug dealers dream so fresh and im so clean
im a grown ass man and youre sweeter than sixteen
so go and kick rocks peons youre just rookies
headed down stairs to get you some milk and cookies

but knew some low down all-around sluts around sluts around sluts

and that she would never be mistaken for a hoe for a hoe
shes tellin lies over twenty years old years old
i guess the game is to be sold not told woooh

and wouldnt shake her booty for a red cent red cent
she said she never fucked three niggas at a time at a time

and couldnt picture tryin to suck a nigga dick suck a dick

just to reiterate dog those was the days
fore da invasions of hatas man crews from all around
use to get down at true flavas bumpin kilo
walkin damage cross colored and paco
while playboy step through talent shows
prom nights tux and kangol was so cool
fuck them new model cars we ridin old school old school

[chorus - keon bryce]
we were tryin so hard
hard to survive
cause even though we were young
we had to stay strong
no matter what we went through
it was me and my crew
and thats how it went
when we were kids

[fate wilson]
in 3 months we stayed in jamestown
hamwood and diplomats
played with transformers gi joes and thundercats
we was lovin that
before they started jackin jacks
fore notes from red oaks had folks scared to come through
college park after dark
crown victorias police unmarked cars
be awarewayne williams was out there
but we aint care kids was gettin stabbed and ditched out there
to busy playin
double dare
you touch shorty on the ass thats a bet
want ya kool-aid and sugar smack ya hands and say sweat
its mine now place it in my louis vitton pouch
thump a nigga on his knuckles make him say ouch
slouch socks box chevy caprice
hot knees cut da holes disturbing tha peace
wit no conscience broke niggas call em nonsense
no comments this lil fate payin homage to college park

[ludacris]
i had a long john but no silver
no gold or plat
i was simply red from the years i been holdin back
with 2 sides to a book i lick stamps and light matches
and set fires in garbage pails and cabbage patches
a child of the corn been wild since i was born
climbin over barb wire clothes got torn
shoes got muddy and my click turned cruddy
wherever i go they went they my buddys
i brush teef brush naps and cold streets
dreamin of cadillacs wood wheels and plush seats
cats with gold teeth and raps with such beats
macks with no grief and some sacks of green leaf
when i loaded my cap gun i was ready for action
starin at beer cans and the moment to crack one
wanna hang with the big boys and play with the big toys
and be with all the people makin all that goddamn noise

[chorus - keon bryce x2]
we were tryin so hard
hard to survive
cause even though we were young

like to hear it hear it go im rehearsing gotta sing my song
i know ive done some wrong but i cant get right
cause life is like a big fight
im stickin-and-movin tryin to get my shit right
my familys been houndin me friends they done turned against me
kinda like they hearts was on a full tank but now they empty
and they say ive changed but like twins im just the same
its because of my job mo money mo prob in this dirty game
this industry fucked up
thats right i said it and its fake as ever
keep real niggaz around me stay space age 4 eva
po-ppa never went and jumped the broom never got that one degree
but if you looked down from heaven youd still be proud of me
your son was dui but my momma made it by
i didnt shed no tears when you left me
but the rest of the family cried
trials and tribulations ruined my concentration
losin my patience hard times for goodness saken

as this valium slowly starts to kick in
them subconcious subliminal thoughts start tickin
this whole world around me diseased and crumblin
babies doin dope cause daddy did it right in front of them
everybody wanna blame music for they bad kids
sittin up in the court talkin bout eminem made me do what i did
my own hard times rolled in like the fog
try to think of others but i cant get past my own thoughts
my momma in 1967 pickin cotton
while other blacks was gettin liberated boycottin
my old man was a player aint no hidin that
he started tootin then he graduated to smokin crack
i never saw him never needed to see that muhfucker
he left me and my mother stuck down here in this fuckin gutter
i tattoed it on my arm so i cant forget it
its in my mind and my heart so im forever with it

[verse one ludacris]
im still back for the first damn time
so grab a hold of your seat while i open your mind
and take you back from when i dropped down from heaven
and i came on my moms and i had a mic as my fucking weapon
when i was three i was just a little g
but if you looked in my eyes you would see the future of a real mc
and at the age of nine i wrote my first ryhme
soon rapping became one of my favorite pasttimes
everywhere that i went spitting and dabbling
showing my ass growing up and started traveling
from one city to the next luda landed in the atl
where the pimps and the players dwell
i made a tape did shows and got ex-po-sure
and kept learning as my black ass got older
no matter what i just kept at my trade
i made mistakes but still stayed sharper than a ginsui blade

[chorus x2]

[verse two ludacris]
age 14 my talent show a beast out of cage
would have won but got disqualified for jumping off stage
but i didnt care cause this game started to open its arms
when i was at banaker high school pulling fire alarms
so i could get a crowd around me make a name for my block
people told me keep flowing they didnt want me to stop
back when big nose john was my human beatbox
skipped out on school hit open campus and look out for street cops
now im known around the town as that nigga that raps
from the hill of maze high to them g roll traps
and i was still making demos perfecting the craft
some said i wouldnt make it they would giggle and laugh
so i picked up a couple books from donald goines
about the busimess of this shit and how to flip a few coins
by the age of eighteen i was destined to make it
my bank account read disturbing the peace incorporated

[chorus x2]

[verse three ludacris]
age 18 im struggling just to survive
but i got a gig working for change at 975
now im rapping on the radio increasing their numbers
still ludacris but alias was chris lova lova
late nights im in the studio using they tools
me and poon was smoking weed and breaking all of they rules
and i was krunk all the big wigs was hearing my songs
but nobody did shit and they was taking too long
three years went past and i saved enough cash
to make my own record company and put my self on blast
the album was independent it was just for the streets
i sold one thousand albums in my first fucking week
then went on to sell fifty put the cash in my hand
all the record companies biting but i chose def jam
the main reason that i made it and i love the a town
was because the block had its eyebrows down ya heard me

its gonna get in ya child of the night
 and the hood rolls on
how do i begin to do this shit right
 get my hustle on

[ludacris]
look here
now im a man of many talents and a man of my word
but on my path to see the light sometimes my vision gets blurred
its all a part of growin up and seein life at its worst
then tryin to iron out my wrinkles puttin family first
it seems like the whole world is out for sinkin my boat
but with god as my navigator ill be stayin afloat
and i admit to bein caught by many foolish distractions
then im forced to pay the price as the result of my actions
im battlin with myself and every day its a war
curiosity killed the cat why am i curious george
gotta keep my nose up outta thangs that aint none of my biz
and just cause somethin looks dont really mean that it is
get through the agony and anger the pain and strife
and take the necessary steps to try to change my life
i got some questions for you lord cause my mentalitys hood
so why is everything thats bad for me feel so good

[chorus]

[ludacris]
now im a only child so excuse some of my selfish ways
i got spoiled when i was young spoil myself today
oh but i feed at least a thousand stomachs and how ive done it
is from the ground up a hundred miles and runnin
dodgin and duckin everybody tryin to hammer me down
a self-made millionaire baby look at me now
cant tell me nothin still hungry as the day i began
cause all i ever really needed was a pen in my hand
and a pad in my lap didnt matter in fact
me and my momma lived in one room and whats badder than that
was a young man forced to grow up at the age of 12
tryin to get in where i fit streets givin me hell
but yet i give it right - back so how you like - that
continue doin wrong til i was on the right - track
tell me bout heavy money i might give it a push
but a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush
come on

[chorus]

[ludacris]
no matter how much older we get man we all still children at heart
we all make mistakes its all good

now ive tried plenty of times to get rid of my bad habits
livin life on the cuttin edge takin a stab at it
and learnin from my mistakes try not to make em twice
just admittin when im wrong tryin hard to make it right
and baby nobodys perfect in this world of ours
theres plenty people gettin stitches in this world of scars
but over time pray to god that he can heal your wounds
try to love and love again until they seal your tomb
cause life is short if you dont know this itll pass you by
thats why my head is in the clouds tryin to pass the sky
never blinkin for a minute keep my eyes on my foes
they wanna catch me in the open bring my life to a close
meanwhile thats why im bringin so much life to my shows
ive seen smiles im makin changes turnin glitter to gold
dont let these devils play you down or belittle your soul
just be happy with yoself and its so simple to grow
come on

[chorus]

[ludacris]
im so far ahead its only right for you to hate on me mayne
when im pushin 90 by myself up in the hob lane
they tryin to figure how many mo women that i can take on my plane
bein one of the few rappers responsible for changin the game
now desperate artists tryin to sue but they just makin some claims
cant get in the spotlight for nothin and it just makes em insane
thats why some of the niggaz resort right back to bakin that caine
and sellin it off to junky monkeys who keep bakin they brain
as they grow older theyll be feelin a lot of achin and pain
so right at the head they might as well just be aimin that thang
and you aint helpin the process out by always cakin these dames
but it is hard givin up the place where they be shakin they thangs

in this life one thing counts
in the bank large amounts
[luda speaks in the background] 

[verse one]
now everybody wants a piece of my pockets
and it dont help when im screaming on these records that im rich
calling people from my number now i block it
cuz aint nothing worse then getting haunted by a stalkin ass bitch oh yeah
cuz good game i talk it and yet youre so true some women will have you feeling blue like crips
i lay my feet upon the path and i walk it
i spread my wealth out or someone close will have me layin in a ditch
i have my friends steal from me
snatch my credit card and my wallet hit the town and leave outstanding bills for me
they say i got the cash for it and i cant recall one single member of my family that never
asked for it
theyve been kicking down doors and bustin out flows 
they cant get me on the phone so they surprise me at my show
and everybody needs a loan plus they say they wont blow it
all i hear common cuz you know im good for it man

[chorus 4x]

[verse two]
now dont get me wrong cuz being rich is such a beautiful thing
but more money more problems people drive me insane
not giving no handouts no more so take advantage and flee
my goals to set my friends up to make some paper like me
put em in position and make their wishes cometrue
so they can have multiple accounts gain interest over night
given a million dollars what you gonedo
map your life out for your kids-kids or would you spend it over night
now see me ill do both i got unlimited funds 
my daughters life was set before her stankin butt turned one 
and it dont help that i got 4 or 5 retirement funds
so if i choose before im 30 i can lay in the sun
my dividends can show and prove the real meaning of fun
thats why i live by the sword but you can die by my gun
the irs ll never sweat me or even put up a fight
cuz im sure ill pay more in taxes then you made in your life
because

[chorus 4x]

[verse three]
now women these days dont want a man without a nice pay check
so he splurge even though our lives aint in right place yet 
buying jewellery and some cars just to impress these whores
meanwhile you childs poor like daddy what you left me for
yeah but it all comes back thats why i named my daughter karma yup
whos teaching me the lesson of life and making me smarter
i sweep her off her feet cuz im her knight in shining armour 
and i have your fucking head if anybody tries to harm her
got to teach her about the game that most of us niggaz will spit
and about these scandalous ass women that get money thru gifts
theyll suck a cold hard wood for some cold hard cash
or ride a brother good to put a foot up on the gas
of that brand new ride pick up our friends
while youre slippin she slides
drop top benz gold diggers inside
crazy what the world will do for money
thinking that everything will be alright
cuz

please like when police say freeze
and i aint do shit but im down on my knees 
its a crooked system but gin straight take the pain away
i charge the game and put my problems on layaway

a black man but i feel so blue
so i smoke green and purple till my dreams come true
then my eyes turn red the sky turns grey 
children slingin white in the hood we call it yay

drinkin old gold down my yellow brick road 
then rewrite my script until my storys untold 
see i got a little money and my life sped up 
now im fallin and i cant get up

trick daddy
i had a dream about a dope fiend
and its strange cause he can barely write or read but seems to get folks just about anything
curious about him i wanted to talk to him
said he was too busy fo that but i was more then welcome to walk with him

as we walked he talked and i just listened
he said theres a big difference between crackers and niggas
see he said white folks look out fo the white folks but uhh
black folks blame otha black folks when they aint enough black roakz

when you ooh to make a long story short
we need pay more attention and do things thats way more convincin
and he told me you know i wouldnt sell you somethin that wasnt workin
and i damn sure wouldnt waste my time tellin ya somethin thatll hurt you

but youll fall for anything if you dont stand for somethin
thats for certain but niggas dont be listen and that shit be hurtin
not all of us but some of us and if we dont hurry up
they going to bury each and every one of us

man i smell somethin fishy goin on
and its way beyond blowin away the smoke from all these swishers goin on

it aint much i can do about it but preach the word
tell my people to spend ya money wisely dont be absurd
buy some things that appreciate like what like a home
wake up and open ya eyes to what the fucks is goings on

cause they constantly gettin rid of us one by one
whether its drugs or diseases or its gun by gun

ludacris
ever since i was an embryo waiting to shape up and ship out
something in my brain said wake up and kick out
roberta and wayne stayed up and flipped out
cause when i came i was draped up and dripped out
snip the umbilical spit the government chip out
peace up a-town gone and then i dipped out
and oh my gosh the osh kosh was picked out
i slipped in even my baby stroller was tricked out
somebody get him the lil niggas out of control
put a lil bit of rum in my bottle ill dream about diamonds and gold gold gold
to grow from an infant to toddler was effervescent
the essence of adolescence got my body feeling freshn
freshn freshn and it was a blessing to rhyme and start rapping
i was the best in my section with flows hard than erections
still the best but now im grown with more range than a texan
and im a heavyweight you niggas is lighter than my complexion

ima be all the way real with cha look
when i came into the game they aint do nothing but doubt me
now the whole games changed and it aint nothing without me
picking up my sloppy seconds as they reach for the crown
only reason you on that song is cause i turned that down
i went from hot wheels to big wheels hyundais to bentleys
and five course meals no more popeyes and blimpies
from alright to handsome from one room to mansions
from hanging on the block to throwing parties in the hamptons
from broke as a joke to rich as a bitch 
i bought a plane and a boat and six other whips no marta
from dice on the curb to stacking up chips but harder
from birds on my nerves to chicks on my dick 
guard your women dawg i went from ashy to classy
went from a kiss on the cheek to doing the nasty
reach your hand up in the air and you can play with the stars
its not the hand that youre dealt 
but how youre playing your cards

whats up you aint never heard a nigga rap like-like this before
i got an addictive flow thatll give you satisfaction
ima make you satisfied even if it kills me
even if it takes the slower minds a little bit of time to feel me
recollect the 15 million i sold or the 30 times i went gold
and if you take 2 puffs of this dro itll give you satisfaction
ive sold the most and noones close but im not meaning to brag
its different strokes for different folks like angelina and brad
some keep the heat in the stash put 30 keys in their jag
and if cops aint peepin your tag then youre gonna feel some satisfaction
pumpin out albums like reverend run is pumpin out children heres another one
so catch me on more 24s than kiefer sutherland
im bound to be the greatest im determined to win
until then i cant get no satisfaction

[chorus]

[verse 2 smoke]
im the one that went to the gunfight with a knife and won
left with his pistol and left him dead the guy he tried to run


just because my verse 2nd dont mean i am not the one
when im done im guaranteed to give you satisfaction
i might not be the best in the world but the best the world ever seen
im all been in georgias daughter conde ding-a-ling king
and when im digging deep in the spleen ima make the cream and she scream
baby get me hard like a snickers bar i give her satisfaction
yessir there aint not other way so motherf**k what you say

ever since i signed with luda and them my chances of losing are slim

we gonna continue to give them a double dose of satisfaction

[chorus]

[verse 3 shawn jay]

things aint always what they seem or cracked up to be 
like all these fakin ass rappers in this industry 
talkin bout what they got and they aint got a damn thang 
how you own three cars but you dont own ya own name 
get ya business right boys the first class is in session 
get a entertainment lawyer in the music profession 
start up ya own company trademark the name 
thats gon run ya bout a grand so start savin ya change 
open a bank account quick and then follow these steps 
sign yourself to yourself and start signin ya own checks 
hit the booth and start recording at the speed of need 
whatever gets ya juices flowin could be speed or weed 
get it mixed and mastered pressed up and plastered 
sell it to ya whole hood out the trunk ya bastard 
show all the non-believers what you destined to be 
and in just a couple years you could be rich like me 

[hook]
but i cant hold my tounge 
ima tell it like it is 
this biz aint all fun 
ima tell it like it is 
give it to ya straight no chase 
ima tell it like it is 
look you straight in yo face 
and ima tell it like it is 

i cant hold my tounge 
ima tell it like it is 
this biz aint all fun 
ima tell it like it is 
give it to ya straight no chase 
ima tell it like it is 
look you straight in yo face 
and ima tell it like it is 

[verse 2]
see mostly all your favorite artists got some serious problems 
the money could be the problem but money cant solve em 
some get addicted to drugs and flat out lazy 
some taste a little fame and go flat out crazy 
im close cause those close wanna live off my fame 
and that type of shit alone will drive a nigga insane 
not to mention all the vultures the scandelous promoters 
crabs will try to sue ya magazines will misquote ya 
most of these label-heads they dont care nothin about ya 
if you stop sellin records theyll act like they dont know ya 
its hard mixin business with pleasure so dont play 
me and my crew argue and fight like every other day 
rappers aint above the law but our life is so fast 
that we got a special task force of police on our ass 
all that and this is really just the start of it 


hip hop you really wanna be a part of it 

[hook]
i cant hold my tounge 
ima tell it like it is 
this biz aint all fun 
ima tell it like it is 
give it to ya straight no chase 
ima tell it like it is 
look you straight in yo face 
and ima tell it like it is 

i cant hold my tounge 
ima tell it like it is 
man this biz aint all fun 
ima tell it like it is 
ima give it to ya straight no chase 
ima tell it like it is 
look you straight in yo face 
and ima tell it like it is 

[verse 3]
whats worse than havin no money is havin it and losin it 
whats worse than havin some money is grabbin and abusin it 
we never took no money from chingy thought i was cool wit him 
i wish his ass well but i dont want nothin to do with him 
some dont own they publishin me i never fool wit em 
im down for my artists try my best to stay true to em 
cause outside my label competition is irrelevant 
unless im still in competition with my president 
and believe that im supportin the hova 
cause the industrys shady it needs to be taken over 
but the first rule to accumalation of wealth 
is dont trust nobody but ya god damned self 

[hook]
i cant hold my tounge 
ima tell it like it is 
man this biz aint all fun 
ima tell it like it is 
im give it to ya straight no chase 
ima tell it like it is 
look you straight in yo face 
and ima tell it like it is 

i said i cant hold my tounge 
ima tell it like it is 
this biz aint all fun 
ima tell it like it is 
give it to ya straight no chase 
ima tell it like it is 
look you straight in yo face 
and ima tell it like it is[intro]
the time has comefor bad things to leave
the time has comefor life to begin
the time has comefor the war of the gods

yes

its that time
ima take the subtle approach first
cause im just gettin started
lets go

[1st verse]
look im the best and theres nothing that you can do about it
never needed a publicity stunt lets tell the truth about it
even in the core of the streets you cant sway the youth about it
but keep runnin yo mouth and i swear ima knock a tooth up out it

i never claimed to be nuthin but who the fuck i am
never sold cocaine in my life but im still the fuckin man
understand nuthin you did makes you better nigga
you claim the streets but the streets respect that chedda nigga

luda got twice as much yo life you can charge it to em
i fit four of your houses inside my daughters room
and still have room for young karma to play
givin back to the children of tommorrow for good karma today

so you can say whatcha wanna say and you can talk that talk
but real niggaz aint doin no talkin cause we walk that walk
album for album you can see i got a multimillion plan
so call yourself whatever you want cept the multimillion man

[2nd verse]
how many times is you gon rap about busting your gun
how many times is you gon trap without busting your gun
only shots you ever took were subliminal to the general
disrespectin those doin real time with real criminals

and i aint never did a day in my life
but it should be illegal to walk a day in my life
i paid the price and the cost to be the boss so you can rest your mouth
im universal luda never limits himself to the south

i give a damn about ya hootin and hollerin and it aint botherin me
i hear you talkin but you aint made it to three
you know where i live but you aint made it to me

you aint made nigga
im havin a house party kid come get played nigga
you got played my record label never jerked me
so shoot me stab me but words will never hurt me
i feed off your energy my powers with god
so its even better if you make ya diss record real hardludacris [verse]

you lookin at a man that would die for his daughter jus to let her breathe
and ill defininetely die for jesus couse he died for me
give my eyes to stevie wonder jus to see what he seen
but then id take em right back to see martin luther dream
i dreamed that i could tell martin luther we made it
but half of my black brothers are still incarcerated		
locked up in a cell block lost from da shell shock
some sold they soul others used to sell rocks
look up in my mail box
i get letters from my cousin every week 
sayin he wanna hit the street
but he never struck a deal 
cause his mouth will never squeal
put some money on his books and help him out with his appeals
send some pictures of the fam and nasty pix of shawnna
if you ever have to leav i got ya mother and ya daughter
born in dis way of livin and da youth is stuck 
to be safe its safe to say the justice systems f**ked up

[chorus]
if you doin 25 to life stay up homie
i got ya money on ice so stay up homie
if you locked in a box keep makin it through
do ya time dont let ya time do you
all my peoples in da pits stay up homie
and until you hit da bricks stay up homie
if you locked in a box keep making it thru 
do ya time dont let ya time do you

beanie segal [verse]

until i went to jail you couldnt tell me i aint seen it all
that box a muthaf**ka itll stress a nigga balls
espectually when you broke and home base aint exceptin ya calls

why shes all all alone and they never met her family
mamas always gone and she never met her daddy
part of her is missin and nobody will listenin
mama is on drugs gettin high up in the kitchen
bringin home men at different hours of the night
startin with laughs--usually endin in a fight
sneak into her room while her mamas knocked out
tryin to have his way and little lisa says ouch
she tries to resist but then all he does is beat her
tries to tell her mom but her mama dont believe her
lisa is stuck up in the world on her own
forced to think that hell is a place called home
nothin else to do but get her clothes and pack
she says shes bout to run away and never come back

so she pops x to get rid of all the pain

so theres no protection hes usin no glove
never thinkin bout the consequences of her actions

the days go by and her belly gets big
the father bails out he aint ready for a kid
knowin her mama will blow it all outta proportion
plus she lives poor so no money for abortion

[ludacris]
lord please forgive me for the mistakes ive made
and thanks for keepin my momma safe when she wrecked my escalade
see i could replace a cadillac but i cant replace my momma
im sorry for the hip-hop beefs we sorry for the drama
but you gotta understand us rappers aint never had nothin
and ones loss is anothers gain so we gotta grab somethin
lord got so many questions i need the answers to
and sorry for the thangs i put my babys mama through
i feel that women are really the strongest human beings
but why do you make em so emotional and other minor things
i guess its your way of sayin we gotta love em and gotta praise em
cause without em wed be nothin plus our kids they gotta raise em
while we out and about and seein what life has to offer
but if you offer a new life then what we need is better fathers
either im smarter cause of my daughter or im just too dense
im 28 years old it just now started makin sense

lord forgive me for anytime a fan said i was bein rude
im only human im not always in the best of moods
but thanks for givin the gift of rap to write my feelings down
and sorry for cursin sometimes but feelings make me shout em out
forgive the people that wanna blame everything on rap music
if they didnt live it they cant relate or even adapt to it
forgive those who dont think im great and wanna see me go
forgive oprah for editin most my comments off her show
dont get me wrong i know some people got a image to hold
but those who criticize the youth might just be gettin too old
we still travellin through life findin whats right or wrong
i know some folks may not agree or even like this song
but im just speakin my truth cause i heard it sets you free
and my conversations with god even though he speaks through me
im smarter cause of my daughter and im not too dense
im 28 years old it just now started makin sense
and ive been

[chorus one]

[ludacris - over chorus one]

ladies and gentlemen we have a special guest in the house tonight
came with some words of encouragement bishop eddie long

[chorus two - repeat 2x minus ad libs]

[outro bishop eddie lee long]
what you just heard is real life
its real life for you its real life for many
its about where you been yet at the same time you
ay you find yourself in the midst of conflict and turmoil
yes im talkin to you in the midst of conflict and turmoil
cause you realize hey - its time to change right now
and in the middle of that i wanna say this
the bible says that when i was a child i spoke as a child
i understood as a child i fought as a child
hey but when i became a man
i put away those childish things
did you not know that your environment has shaped you
where you were born in the projects in the ghettoes
in the upper downtown wherever it was
the people around you the things around you
cause you to do strange things because you were seeking to learn
but what you learned was on the streets and not in the book
god called you a prophet
when you open up your mouth everything of god comes out
and it commands attention it commands change
im talking about the power thats inside of you
and in the midst when youre starting to understand
that i caught the wrong message and now its time
im hearing from god what amazing experience as you hear from god
he said is there forth any man be in christ he is a new creation
old things are passed away somebody needs to hear that and behold
everything becomes new and when everything becomes new in you
its time to stop the killing
i said its time to stop the stealing
its time to stop disrespecting our women
its time for us to come home and raise our children
its time for us to really mold our communities
its time for us not to get hooked up in religion
but to get hooked up in relationship with god
and the amazing thing about it
is wherever you find yourself right now you can confess
and you can tell god im sorry;
i had the wrong cue i was doing the wrong thing
i was going after things that i thought were right but it wasnt right
and now that im getting it right im asking you to forgive me
and i may have done the things that they said i did
but im not who they say i am; i am who you made me to be
and im changing in that and it takes a few moments
but every time i fall down ill get right back up
and every time i make a wrong turn ill get myself back in line
because i recognize i have been called for such a time as this
you cant resist the change
and youre not condemned by your yesterday
if you can grab hold of your now and move in your destiny
move change and be now

[chorus three sung by choir]
searchin so looooong lost in the clouuuuuds
tryin to stay strooooong and make you prouuuuud - make you proud
took me some tiiiiime took me some time now i seeeee
heeeee resiiiides heeee resiiiides in me in me yeahhhhh[chorus]

now everyday i wake up
somebody done call it quits
s*** i thought bobby and witney stay together forever if they made it that long
i guess the drugs werent that strong
and now its russel and carmora even jordan and wanita
and to top it off brad left jen for angelina
what the hell is going on in this world
this just cant be
if will and jada can do it than why cant we
hillary is still with bill clinton
how did they do it
he got his dick sucked and the whole damn world knew it
now paul mccartney losing half of his life
all because he got divorced from his wife
somebody said its cheapa to keep her
but not in k-feds case no
cause britney even had to pay for k-feds case cha-ching
nick and jessica trina and wayne
and if you broke up with your girl
i know you feelin da pain because

lauren hill with the fugees
remmy with terror squad

snoop with mo-dray
dray with mo-big boys
cds with mo-plays
drives with no press
salt with no pepper
even the eagles broke up and got the f*** back together
selling millions of copies
and getting mad cash
and rass b six criss stope was getting mad a**
i dont even understand it
what the hell went wrong
maybe folks will wise up and take heed to this song because

and try any and everything they never did with they man me

tha bank yells mayday like everydays a payday
i put it on tape then i sell it like ray j
but not out tha store nope straight to tha buyer
cause i slung em out my trunk like tha dc sniper
and 6 albums later youll deposit every word
til ya memory bank give me tha credit i deserve
top 5 damn right but really it just hit me
that 3 of yo top 5s too scared to fuck with me
so how can i advance if u dont give me no opponents
how can you see tha future if you living for tha moment

but i offer yall a day of atonement

and my deliveries invaded your vicinity hennesy is my remedy takin shots like kennedy

now this is what they call poetry in motion
my soul bleeds on the paper heart screams with emotion
its my daily devotion that verses stay deeper then the ocean
so hip hop you owe me a promotion
yea i do a little boastin and braggin
whats all the commotion and naggin about
cause im still the champ in the south
cause rappers get in the booth and i keep draggin em out
where they firin these pink slips im handin em out
cause this is theater of the mind
consider it a sign of whats to come next
my moneys just fine bank filled with dumb checks
terrorist threat flow proceed to drop bombs like mr funk flex
but i dont do it for the money i do it from the heart
i do it with the beatbox i did it from the start
i do it for the djs i do it for the charts
the van gogh flow luda do it cause its art
i do it for the fans i do it on command
i do it for the front row i do it for the stands
i spit it for the hood i do it for the block
and since nine years old i did it for hip hop

i don’t do for the cars and the fancy drops
i do it for hip-hop
i do it for hip-hop
i do it for hip-hop
and i don’t do for the chains and the flashin’ rocks
i do it for hip-hop
i do it for hip-hop
i do it for hip-hop

[nas]
they say i’m so low key i’m socially awkward
only niggas who really know me who i talk with
they smile in the light hate in the dark
you call it beef to me its just a fuckin’ walk in the park
because you are who you are when nobodys lookin
thats who you are so when the cash and the cars is gone
the day after tomorrow don’t be askin’ to borrow
ski maskin’ it hard like the way you rap in your bars
i could ride on you and whoever devise new endeavors
i’m as live as a hive full of predators
twenty thousands different species of bees
some have poisonous sting some just pollinate leafs
like rap some just buzz some will attack
compromise their own life in fact
sixteen years since my first sixteen
pardon the rest of my niggas
but i’m the best whoever did it

[ludacris]
i don’t do for the cars and the fancy drops
[nas]
i do it for hip-hop
i do it for hip-hop
[ludacris]

i do it for hip-hop
i do it for hip-hop
i do it for hip-hop

[jay-z]
hip-hop started out in the park
we used to do it to avoid the narcs
i used to do it so the homeboy clark can get the fuck off my back while i knocked off these packs
i used to rap to impress my friends
to pass the time while i was gettin’ it in
just so happens i’m so illegal with the pen they ain’t want me doing anything illegal again
i lost a lot of dogs to these streets
i got grammy awards on these beats
thank god for cool herc
without this shit i probably woulda got murked
shout outs to grandmaster flash and the cash
and even jaz bum ass
hip hop helped me wash my rocks
these other rappers couldn’t wash my socks
that’s why i took the number one slot
the realest shit in rap comes from my voice box
lord knows when i was on my clock
i probably never woulda stopped
thank god for hip-hop

[ludacris]
i don’t do for the cars and the fancy drops
[jay-z]

but i cant steal what you never made up bitch

let me explain nothings been new since big daddy kane
flows will get recycled passed around to different names
but whats the same that every verse i spit is insane

until they roaches buried in my ashtray
nigga burn slow better pray like its your last day

thats disrespecting pioneers in the game
fuck the fame but go ahead and get ya 5 minutes
then you front line cadets can report to your lieutenants sir yes sir
see im ya past im ya future and ya present
so watch ya fucking mouth when you speak about a legend
16 times platinum 6 number 1′s
so i can give a fuck what you sold in ya first week
yous weak softer than the pillsbury dough boy
dont make me expose the truth yous a hoe boy
dont make me get on that stomp shit and get back at it
you rappers aint even in my fucking tax bracket
why am i wasting my time
yeah i admit i get a little ludacris with my rhymes sometimes
but my fans know the difference because my chick bad went platinum still winning muthafucka

the nerve of you niggas man you aint got enough medals on your jacket to address me boy
fall back in formation yall outta line
i was told not to kill a mosquito with a cannon
so the next time you nats got a real problem
dont be a coward like a nigga that used to be signed to be going on twitter rants and shit
nigga say it to my face[chorus]
aye before i eat an mc i say my grace
leave you dead without a trace
got a problem with me say it to my face
to my face to my face to my face to my face to my face
put a pussy ass nigga all in his place
didnt your bosses ever tell you niggas you could be replaced
to the fans yous a disgrace got a problem with me
say it to my face to my face to my face to my face to my face
put a pussy ass nigga all in his place

[ludacris - verse 1]
ay got a chopper kinda like a helicopter
for any nigga that think its sweet
and you better call a doctor
have you shaking like a maraca
dripping like this beat
blood spillin like a faulty faucet
plug his ass fore you end up in the hearse
put the gear in reverse
then you better hit the fuckin gas
you broke now you bitter
but how the hell is a nigga start beef with me on his fuckin twitter
you know where ill be you know where ill stay
i aint that hard to find
all upon my d when the dtp boy youre sweeter than a valentine
how can you call yourself a man boy
yous ludacris number one fan boy
then you left and youre gone goodbye
lazy eye dont miss you
then you signed to a nigga who signed to a nigga who signed to another nigga smart move
boy you dumb as hell
you should take your soul and have an end of the summer sale
but all your records my theme songs
why cause im still shopping of your ring tone

[chorus]

[ludacris - verse 2]
to you internet gangstas
facebook hoes e-mail bullies i can see your camel toe
instead of talking to a nigga straight up you rather send a text
well i think you a bitch and you should change your sex
hiding behind your phone screen better run the other way
you playing for the wrong team
dick in the booty ass nigga
oh take another dude to the movie ass nigga
i can see youre kit kat gimme a break hit him in his face
how you keep it real when you know a nigga fake
better hit the brakes when you see me nigga shake
you goin into convulsions hater emotions and epileptic seizures
put a nail in a nigga your career is over hang em up like jesus
amen sayonara okay then
next time you crying tell a bitch nigga
but keep in mind yous a bitch nigga

[chorus]

[meek mill - verse 3]
put a pussy ass nigga in his face with that tooly on my waist like huh
i put it to his face then i ask tha pussy ass nigga how taste like huh
he said it taste like nah nah

niggas thinkin its been a game til the shots hit his body bend his ass like limbo
give my shooters your info
send em right to your place put em right in your face
nigga like what you say
catch you night time and then brighten your day
shots at your head they dont like what you say
coroners coming to wipe you away
thangs can get jiggy here right with tha k
wherever you standing thats right where you lay
yall niggas run yo mouth just like a bunch of bitches
pussy niggas talking just like a bunch of snitches
lord be my witness i ask for forgiveness
but if these pussy niggas keep running they mouth ima give them the bidness
heard you pussy ass niggas talking about me when im not around
told another nigga so he told another nigga and it got around
so i told the other nigga go tell the other nigga move out of town

moving packages like ups trucks
paraphernalia in my stash box
i hear the botton in the bentley makes this ass drop
your rims too small gone shoe fly

fresh pair of js i brought the mikes out
and some ammo thatll knock a nigga lights out
i was everywhere call me the butcher

[luda]
i got some head from this chick she like my baritone
her name was terra she said welcome to the terra dome
phantom drop head im the worst
all blue body lose the top on papa smurf
hey hit the strip club bring the bucks out
same way every day like a bus route
long ranger no tonto
my nine got my back like rajon rondo
the gat is out gat is out pulling night duty
always exposed like ice tea wife booty
pull a double shift im on my grind
watch 80 grands swag working over time

[2x hook][gucci mane]
hey how you doin’ ms lady you so fine with it
i know you handlin’ business can i get your 5 minutes
don’t be offended by me telling you you thick with it
wit all that shake can a player get some fries with it
wit all that shake can a player get some fries with it
wit all that shake can a player get some fries with it
don’t be offended when i tell you that you’re very pretty
wit all that shake can a player get some fries with it
‘s gucci

[ludacris - verse 1]
that waist got a swivel to it
but that ass a cali earthquake jiggle to it
she a stallion no horseshit
you could fit that bitch’s booty on a forklift
beep beep bitch back it up
i put my balls on the table tell her rack ‘em up
vanilla bed sheets chocolate laid one way
sprinkle my nuts on top — what a sundae hey
whipped cream cherry on top
and when i ain’t wit’ her pussy on lock
throw away the key it’s a rap bitch
large shake and a ludacris sandwich

[hook]

[gucci mane]
yo mama turned out she so popular
you suckers can’t see her with binoculars
she’ll suck your pocket dry like dracula
her last boyfriend bought her an acura
don’t try to get all attached to her
she an alley-cat type — that chick’ll scratch you up
like bel biv devoe said she’s dangerous
her old man used to snort angel dust
so don’t be quick to judge shorty bad as fuck
she’s the type that drive back with the bricks for bucks
she had a ballplayer dude but she fucked him up
he bankrupt selling cars like an auctioner
it’s gucci

[hook]

[ludacris]
i’ve got a sausage for them hot cakes
and i be fuckin’ while you niggas out on hot dates
you all polite and open doors for her
while every night i put that blanket on the floor for her
these hoes be sprintin’ like it’s track ‘n’ field
because this supersize dick is their happy meal
so for an extra value woody
put this big mac into that quarter-pound pussy yes
it’s ludacris mr slay-a-bitch
unless that p-ssy is smelling like a filet-o-fish
shoo fly ho kick the bucket
and niggas talking shit i bust ‘em in their chicken nugget

[hook]well well what do we have here
still getting pussy from that gift i gave her last year
but its a new day she want a macbook
so i showed her how the backseat of a lac look
she talking handbags and gucci slippers
she serve me like a waiter and all i can do is tip her
talking about she needs some gas money
you better hop upon that pole and shake that ass for me
oh hoe stop acting all boogie
knowing you give it up for churchs chicken and a movie
big bucks i got them
its amazing what theyll do for a pair of them red bottoms

yeah she says she needs some rent money
i told her hop upon this dick for me
she says she need to pay her condo
yeah well i need some daddy long stroke
she asked me about her phone bill
i asked her to show me just how that dope feel
she says she need to pay tuition
well drop down to the floor and assume the fucking position

do something strange for a little piece of change
do something strange for a little piece of change
do something strange for a little piece of change
do something strange for a little piece of change

i told her uh uh jerome is in the house bitch
fuck the bed we bout to stay right on this couch bitch
i told her if she hit it right

i keep a pocket full of franks time to work my magic

spray the chevrolet red like its from cincinnati
baby giving me head with superior talent
i pay for that pussy like its a rented car
i ring the phone i grab it all up in that car
take her to a spot shes never been in life
the niggers loosers me and luda in the winner slot

yeah she says she needs some rent money
i told her hop upon this dick for me
she says she need to pay her condo
yeah well i need some daddy long stroke
she asked me about her phone bill

do sumthin strange for a little piece of change
do sumthin strange for a little piece of change[ludacris]
look i make my own decisions
learn from my own mistakes
my enemies they want beef but dont know whats at stake
i started out with nothing just a dream and some hope
i fiend for the riches like them crackheads fiend for the dope
i went from freeze tag to holding some weed bags
to a clown of hoes juggling my bean bag
i went from spin the bottle to kiss the model
to 3 more seconds we gone find out if she spits or swallows
i heard its a recession while you hardly survive
the hardest decision of my day is which car ima drive
rolls royce phantom maybe the gold ac
or the origami ferrari the way it fold back
this aint no 760 bitch this an alpiner
custom kicks chrome lips as deep as vagina
and women lost for words guess they dont know english
no matter what language they speak they all know dinglish

[hook]
dont you understand with this blunt in my hand
im fire smoke smoke smoke sumthin;
and dont you understand with the world in my hand
if i aint the shit
dont you understand with this blunt in my hand
im fire smoke smoke smoke sumthin;
and dont you understand with the world in my hand
if i aint the shit

[ludacris]
now as the world turns spinning on its axis
my dick be brushing womens lips like chapstick
they say its cold on the outside
so like a dentist im tryna keep the mouth wide
reminiscing on my days on the southside
i made many leak and i aint talkin bout no housewives
from eating canned tuna to shoe hills with puma
from women saying hey chris to goddamn luda
from playing slap box to making the lac drop
to white neighbours swear im selling crack rock
eyes so low they think im asian when im blazing
cause that purples on my chest like im playing for the ravens
cadillac devilles still rolling til the tires flat
not from arizona but i swear i want that diamond back
sunroof tar wood grain wheel
i sign for millions yall would never get the same deal

[hook]

[big krit]
i got a candy coated fetish hoe dont you forget it
but big big big let me wet it its that k-r-i-t stay besides me
we can go get this dough then we mind if you show me dime
i promise you wont let go
i got an old school and that bass big
if it aint on chrome than it aint me
and my mouthpiece colder than the ice season
call me father winter in the peak of summer i spit december
breaking backs as they cracking limber
if thats your bitch than she cant remember
i give her wood she holla timber
and the paint i play the sum or attention
television of a player with an intention to be rich
well i hate to mention
back again one more time for the buck niggas
and the thoroughbread that wont fuck with em
and hanged on cause i stuck with em
i aint got time to waste hoe
didnt have shit now i make more than i can barely count
keep the thoroughbread shaking what the good lord gave em
yo chick ass been a bounce
we still live from the underground
aint nothing changed to me
i put it down from the south and body everything these lames claim to be
young chris…

[hook][coughs]

to run a midnight train like gladys knight
im higher than the prices at petro
higher than the balloon after you let go
cuz im smokin on that loud in the middle of a crowd
and the loud is really louder than techno
ive got my weed card on the way to the store to get medicinal marijuana
luda study more buddha than the dalai lama

but my fans know the difference because my chick bad went platinum still winning muthafucka

aye before i eat an mc i say my grace
leave you dead without a trace

put a pussy ass nigga all in his place

[ludacris - verse 1]
ay got a chopper kinda like a helicopter
for any nigga that think its sweet

but how the hell is a nigga start beef with me on his fuckin twitter
you know where ill be you know where ill stay

then you left and youre gone goodbye

then you signed to a nigga who signed to a nigga who signed to another nigga smart move

you should take your soul and have an end of the summer sale
but all your records my theme songs
why cause im still shopping of your ring tone

[chorus]

[ludacris - verse 2]
to you internet gangstas
facebook hoes e-mail bullies i can see your camel toe

hiding behind your phone screen better run the other way
you playing for the wrong team
dick in the booty ass nigga
oh take another dude to the movie ass nigga
i can see youre kit kat gimme a break hit him in his face
how you keep it real when you know a nigga fake
better hit the brakes when you see me nigga shake

put a nail in a nigga your career is over hang em up like jesus
amen sayonara okay then
next time you crying tell a bitch nigga
but keep in mind yous a bitch nigga

[chorus]

[meek mill - verse 3]
put a pussy ass nigga in his face with that tooly on my waist like huh

shots at your head they dont like what you say
coroners coming to wipe you away
thangs can get jiggy here right with tha k
wherever you standing thats right where you lay
yall niggas run yo mouth just like a bunch of bitches
pussy niggas talking just like a bunch of snitches
lord be my witness i ask for forgiveness
but if these pussy niggas keep running they mouth ima give them the bidness

told another nigga so he told another nigga and it got around
so i told the other nigga go tell the other nigga move out of town
cause my dawg playing hard ball with the sawed off now you outta bounds

watch 80 grands swag working over time

[2x hook][gucci mane]
hey how you doin’ ms lady you so fine with it

[ludacris - verse 1]
that waist got a swivel to it
but that ass a cali earthquake jiggle to it
she a stallion no horseshit
you could fit that bitch’s booty on a forklift
beep beep bitch back it up
i put my balls on the table tell her rack ‘em up
vanilla bed sheets chocolate laid one way
sprinkle my nuts on top — what a sundae hey
whipped cream cherry on top
and when i ain’t wit’ her pussy on lock
throw away the key it’s a rap bitch
large shake and a ludacris sandwich

[hook]

[gucci mane]
yo mama turned out she so popular
you suckers can’t see her with binoculars
she’ll suck your pocket dry like dracula
her last boyfriend bought her an acura
don’t try to get all attached to her
she an alley-cat type — that chick’ll scratch you up
like bel biv devoe said she’s dangerous
her old man used to snort angel dust
so don’t be quick to judge shorty bad as fuck
she’s the type that drive back with the bricks for bucks
she had a ballplayer dude but she fucked him up
he bankrupt selling cars like an auctioner
it’s gucci

[hook]

[ludacris]
i’ve got a sausage for them hot cakes
and i be fuckin’ while you niggas out on hot dates

while every night i put that blanket on the floor for her
these hoes be sprintin’ like it’s track ‘n’ field
because this supersize dick is their happy meal
so for an extra value woody
put this big mac into that quarter-pound pussy yes
it’s ludacris mr slay-a-bitch
unless that p-ssy is smelling like a filet-o-fish
shoo fly ho kick the bucket
and niggas talking shit i bust ‘em in their chicken nugget

[hook]well well what do we have here

do sumthin strange for a little piece of change[ludacris]
look i make my own decisions
learn from my own mistakes
my enemies they want beef but dont know whats at stake
i started out with nothing just a dream and some hope
i fiend for the riches like them crackheads fiend for the dope
i went from freeze tag to holding some weed bags
to a clown of hoes juggling my bean bag
i went from spin the bottle to kiss the model
to 3 more seconds we gone find out if she spits or swallows
i heard its a recession while you hardly survive
the hardest decision of my day is which car ima drive
rolls royce phantom maybe the gold ac
or the origami ferrari the way it fold back
this aint no 760 bitch this an alpiner
custom kicks chrome lips as deep as vagina
and women lost for words guess they dont know english
no matter what language they speak they all know dinglish

[hook]
dont you understand with this blunt in my hand
im fire smoke smoke smoke sumthin;
and dont you understand with the world in my hand
if i aint the shit
dont you understand with this blunt in my hand
im fire smoke smoke smoke sumthin;
and dont you understand with the world in my hand
if i aint the shit

[ludacris]
now as the world turns spinning on its axis
my dick be brushing womens lips like chapstick
they say its cold on the outside
so like a dentist im tryna keep the mouth wide
reminiscing on my days on the southside
i made many leak and i aint talkin bout no housewives
from eating canned tuna to shoe hills with puma
from women saying hey chris to goddamn luda
from playing slap box to making the lac drop
to white neighbours swear im selling crack rock
eyes so low they think im asian when im blazing
cause that purples on my chest like im playing for the ravens
cadillac devilles still rolling til the tires flat
not from arizona but i swear i want that diamond back
sunroof tar wood grain wheel
i sign for millions yall would never get the same deal

[hook]

[big krit]
i got a candy coated fetish hoe dont you forget it
but big big big let me wet it its that k-r-i-t stay besides me
we can go get this dough then we mind if you show me dime
i promise you wont let go
i got an old school and that bass big
if it aint on chrome than it aint me
and my mouthpiece colder than the ice season
call me father winter in the peak of summer i spit december
breaking backs as they cracking limber
if thats your bitch than she cant remember
i give her wood she holla timber
and the paint i play the sum or attention
television of a player with an intention to be rich
well i hate to mention
back again one more time for the buck niggas
and the thoroughbread that wont fuck with em
and hanged on cause i stuck with em
i aint got time to waste hoe
didnt have shit now i make more than i can barely count
keep the thoroughbread shaking what the good lord gave em
yo chick ass been a bounce
we still live from the underground
aint nothing changed to me
i put it down from the south and body everything these lames claim to be
young chris…

[hook][coughs]

spread a lil cologne on my clothes feeling like versace blue jeans
while yall smoking that rough weed that dirt shit that ragamuff
i’m smoking on that homegrown and pass out cuz i done had enough
of that sour diesel that northern lights and that killa cali
they see me out up oahu honolulu smoking that maui wowie

[chorus]

[verse 2 ludacris]
look dont fret
you niggas need a better connect you gotta get your status up
yall smoke that stress we smoke that shit that won the cannabis cup
now im higher than a satellite eating everything like a parasite
now we in the streets looking for the baddest dike
to run a midnight train like gladys knight
im higher than the prices at petro
higher than the balloon after you let go
cuz im smokin on that loud in the middle of a crowd
and the loud is really louder than techno
ive got my weed card on the way to the store to get medicinal marijuana
luda study more buddha than the dalai lama
granddaddy purp bubble gum or the og kush
white widow or the g13 and the irene got your homies shook
but that jack herer and the headband got my homies wired
and the blueberry yum yums that fire

[chorus]

[verse 3 wiz khalifa]

brownies trippy sticks and vaporizers we could smoke a bowl
all these niggas smokin weed around me its a smoke-a-thon
crowded in my whip its partly cloudy cuz we smokin strong
you say you cant smoke them joints probably cuz you rolled it wrong
my dollars up im gettin em and i’m foldin it

security and a nigga that own a bitch askinmic check 1 2
im just going to get right to it
luda

aint nobody fuckin with me when it come to getting lyrical
murdering the rapper and killing beats nigga
im cinematic making everybody panic
i be bustin like a fully automatic feel the heat nigga
we can battle in the phantom in atlanta the rover in minnesota or the arizona streets nigga

one time for the sneak dissers ol puss ass fuckboys say my name
anybody coming at me know i never back down killing a rapper is my claim to fame
you lame
and my flow is what expose in these hoes even on a nigga worst day
they say luda dont want it no mo

what you want how you want it you can get im the definition of a real g from the south side
the crime scene be the studio get the yellow tape and the chalk and im leaving everybody outline
im all about mine
getting paid getting laid getting clothes getting hoes getting green back
used be like everybody is a lil kid now big boy outcast like three stacks
laying all it in the cadillac with a red bone giving me dome my music on with the seats back
ludacris this is album number 8 and my pockets gonna be straight
even if a nigga leak that
timmy all up on the david banner track with janet jack in the back like damn luda freak that
break it down like you dropping to the ground but we like the 808 in atlanta so bring the beat back
sample had to eat that
couldnt control all of the leader
but put any other rapper on the track and i guarantee theyll never know how to treat that
im a boss im a king im a legend imma drill it in your head till you dose off
and i just so happen to be the type of rapper that make your women want to take her clothes off
so lets get to the action
lets get to the show
im been getting to the forbes list six year straight lets get to the do
shout out to the luda nation
all my fans just got live
and they waitin for everybody to put me in the rapper category of ya top five

let me get it back

ever since i
came in the game it aint never been the same
cant nobody do it like me
is it ever gonna be another luda you know thatll never happen thats highly unlikely
knowing that im better than everybody you put me up against im in the hall of fame
so fuck call to call we can go bar for bar ill put your name up on the wall of shame
and everyday is the same thing
looking for another way for me to make paper
i think its time for every single rapper to go to church
whoever is my opponent you better pray first
they like luda why you rapping so fast
im like bitch why you listen too slow
im the truth in the booth and they cant keep up hardly cause i always hit em with a new flow
and the two door with the coup low with the hublot off the window with the two low blades 
from the top like judo listening to bruno on the way to school though getting kudos from a few hoes and they from the choose though
cuz im numero uno and the crew know its a couple loop holes when it come to fluke hoes cuz some of they pussy bite like kujo
but back to the you know who
i cant stop till you tell me im the greatest
if you need a reminder then put the whole song on repeat and continue to play this
better turn your stereo louder
listen up and let me preach
and lets get arrested for disturbing the peaceyeah
did some movies and started missing this rap shit
back to rap and starting missing them movies
left these hoes to settle down with just one chick
get with one chick started missing them groupies
stop drinking for a year and i was all sober
next year i got drunk and did it all over
yesterday i quit smoking and swore i had enough
till i smelt it in the club and had to take a puff
i got rich and learned life was a bitch
now everybodys after all of my ends
get yo hand out my pocket
when i was broke all love from my folks
but nowadays im losing all of my friends let the story begin

the grass is always greener on the other side
always searching for another high
the grass is always greener on the other side
caterpillar to a butterfly

the grass is always greener on the other side
always searching for another high
the grass is always greener on the other side
caterpillar to a butterfly

bye bye butterfly
fly away
bye bye butterfly
fly away

yeah
start exercising and winning got me a six pack
was eating healthy and did away with the junk
then i got lazy and started to wanna kick back
my six pack reverted back to a gut
when im at the crib im mad im not at the club lit
when im at the club im mad im not at the crib
i used to be out partying every damn night
now sometimes id rather be with my kids
i got checks gained a lot of respect now everywhere i go they holla my name luda
but sometimes wish that i was disguised for peace of mind over fortune and fame
guess what im really saying

the grass is always greener on the other side
always searching for another high
the grass is always greener on the other side
caterpillar to a butterfly

yeah
last year got the ferrari that i always wanted
drove it crazy got sick of it had to trade give me my ac
all my fans convinced me to grow my hair back
grew it back then started missing my fade
i got hits start trippin i wasnt underground
got underground start trippin i need hits we outta here
when you down and people give you the runaround
but feels great to know who really gives a shit
you cut the grass and the snakes will show
and know your neighbors fertilizer is fake dont let it fool ya
we always searching what we never had
always ignoring whats in front of our face
weve been conditioned to think

the grass is always greener on the other side
always searching for another high
the grass is always greener on the other side
caterpillar to a butterflyyeah
anything you wanna do im ready to do it my nigga just say so
dont say it on the record with your chest leave the booth and then go lay low
hiding behind your security detail actin like a female
i done sold over 20 million records i could really give a fuck about retail
now back to basics
back to adidas with the fat laces
back to the ac where im riding to the track in the track get it straight nigga no chases
age aint nothing but a number luda rapping like he just turned 24
any rapper wanna forget who i am every now and then i see i gotta let em know
yo must i remind you
you rap like something behind you
got paid but your heart pump kool aid
cover girl make up should have signed you
but its never too late
15 years nigga never too great
4 years off getting hollywood checks but you niggas want beef and you looking like steak

i see that liquor got you loose
when you see me nigga say it like you said it in the booth
ill make you niggas lose a tooth
when you see me nigga say it like you said it in the booth
fuck yall niggas im the truth
when you see me nigga say it like you said it in the booth
now im like fuck calling a truce
when you see me nigga say it like you said it in the booth

hol up
never fuck with a nigga who got some kids
cause when you talk about me then you talk about them
then i gotta come where you live
you takin food out they mouth now i gotta put a fist in yours
i dont play about my hustle
a nigga got all these acres
all my neighbors think im flipping them birds
naw but i be flipping these words
anything you hear me saying i could back up
and you talk so tough on the mic
but whenever you in sight nigga something dont add up
put your money where your mouth is

when you see me nigga say it like you said it in the boothey man if you got a problem with somebody
whatever happened to approaching them
looking at em eye to eye
too much tweefin going on in this world
thumb thuggin is at an all-time high
they startin to take this shit a lil too far jack
rappers all in they feelings
well here goes a little lyrical healing

and hip hop is uh
too many rappers gettin sensitive
yall should start a pussy ass nigga initiative
cause even when im not micd up
ill fuck your life up
come to your show when ya crowdsurfin and hold a knife up
i tell your momma you aint shit
i hope you skydive and all land in an alligator pit
your album aint shit you couldnt sell it at an auction
your five minutes is up like antoine dodson
meanwhile that mary jane got me wiser
and mr jack daniels is my spiritual advisor
now everybody said im strapped and im too scary
and keep a hand under the pillow like the tooth fairy
your favorite rapper say im sick and they aint no antidote
they kidnapping my flows they aint even leave a ransom note
your shit is faker than the knockoff man
ill make you niggas quit rappin start a hot dog standuh mic check 1-2 go get em
listen close nigga yeah

uh if rappers want it they can get it
flow tighter than four fat bitches sittin in a civic
my flows are unimaginable hannibal lecter shit
eatin emcees for breakfast bitch
since i was born to touch the mic
the first time its been a problem
your life was a mistake
your pops shouldve wore a condom
you niggas think you hard
i think you better come harder go hard
i leave rappers confused like william barber
ah fuckin with ludas not a great look
a versell make your fans unfriend you on facebook
click my styles are goin into labor
so if stars won a war i made daddy like darth vader
and since im always high its kind of hard to overlook me
for over a hundred stacks its kind of hard to overbook me
and a whole nother house for my cars is on my checklist
cause to fit em in one garage is like a nigga playin tetris
but they say patience is a virtue
cause i got your bitch stayin out way past her curfew
guess i was a thief that got away with these words
slangin chickens out my whip like i been playin angry birds
in a black rolls royce dark knight like batman
everywhere you turn the ghost follows like pac-man
and i sleep with the john dillinger
and always keep an eye half-open like forest whitaker
no you boys aint ready for combat
be more worried if i renew my def jam contract
what path is he on opponents i laugh and be gone
they handin in the towels like they work in bed bath &amp; beyond
but in the midst of all the melee
yall niggas just bitches with dicks like sheneneh
your rap styles are phony your lines are just dead
and i be on them lines like a nigga just played
guess im tryin to say im advanced you intermediate
you wouldnt know the real me if your bitch wikipediad it
just know that i never tried to be hard
probably cause mr glock 40s my security guard
youll get chopped like judo
gangs in my hood make you reverse
and change your color like the blocks playin uno
and yes some of my friends is still sellin them drugs
but i just say they weight watchers like jennifer hud
they show me love
thats why ill always stay reppin until the death of me
rappers talk shit but aint nobody ever stepped to me
i hereby command all my fans to inject it
overdose on red bull in your veins if you ever slept on me
yeah my mind is sharper than a guillotine
all the nines extended from the knuckles of wolverine
not a x-man but man i got that x
im on my hardest switch labels but i still get a cheque
the more albums they sell the more we all win
and i can be seen in thirty rocks like alec baldwin
or watchin cbs in a cadillac dts
i plan to reach the world man your plan is metropcs
i changed my music up cause i was gettin bored
you may not like the way i shoot but my points go on the board
my name still engrained and these books will be the outcome
and this one verse is harder than a lot of niggas albums

peace fuck out of here rewind that shit

hold upi keep dwellin on the past babe
know what i need yeah

i need some real good lovin
cause im troubled by the things that i see
i need some real good lovin
cause aint nobody been around here lovin on me

its better to love and then lost than to never have loved at all
if that was true i wouldnt be drinking this alcohol
every relationship failed to take a toll on you
especially when you had hoes and area codes on you
is it easier to erase my memories
at a point when most of my past women became my enemies
some on the fence some befriended me
but when we see each other its gon be some weird energy
im sorry that we couldnt make it work
believe in your heart i never intended to make you hurt
now they see me on the blogs with my new girl
friends talking bout thats supposed to be you girl

i need some real good lovin
cause im troubled by the things that i see
i need some real good lovin
cause aint nobody been around here lovin on me

i got a empty hole in my chest
how do i fill it somebody give a prescription
i guess i gotta learn to live with regrets
pay for mistakes and your exes take a commission
but whats a percent off the top when you hit the bottom
after you break up wondering how to live without em
need solutions less problems
cause if love will drive you crazy i belong in the insane asylum
hear the rain feel the pain inside em
kinda lost need someone to guide em
its nothin worse than feelin alone
but ill admit to feelin better when im hearing this song it goes

i need some real good lovin
cause im troubled by the things that i see
i need some real good lovin
cause aint nobody been around here lovin on me

so i dwelling on the past all the moments on repeat baby
playing empty songs when im blowing my high
feeding my heart to a lion called guilt on an empty bed
on an empty bed
dwelling on the past all the moments on repeat
playing empty songs when im blowing my high
feeding my heart to a lion called guilt on an empty bed
while i lose my mind
so you know what i need

i need some real good lovin
cause im troubled by the things that i see
i need some real good lovin
cause aint nobody been around here lovin on meand the winner for the best rap album goes to

id hug him everyday like i might not see him tomorrow
got a little sorrow for a lifetime
cause when he was living im thinking how do i get him to listen
when he was seldom in his right mind
my early years i was too young to understand
but i remember the smell of beer and seeing all the empty cans
waking up crying in the night hearing arguments
hands off my momma somehow i knew he was the cause of it
got a little older and he got a little worse
drinking must be his remedy he got a little cursed
well tell me whats the cure for a man who miss his pops
the beat goes on but the drinkings gotta stop

if i had have know i wouldnt see you tomorrow
i wouldve had you hold to your heart and put your love in a bottle hey
but now you got me drunk out that pain gone after sorrow
wishing every day you were here with me
but now that youre gone i lost my heart to the bottle to the bottle
ooh oh oh

yeah i lost my father to the bottle
function and alcoholics what they call it far as i know
became a teenager and started to understand
but even through drinks he still taught me to be a man
so before the hospital when the paramedics rest him
he knew that everybody who met him instantly loved him
i run the con concerts would have made him even sicker
cause who gon tell him he cant drink none of his sons liquor
and tell me without my father how am i supposed to manage
he had the biggest heart but also had that liver damage
tell me whats the cure for a man who miss his paps
the beat goes on but the drinking gotta stop

if i had have know i wouldnt see you tomorrow
i wouldve had you hold to your heart and put your love in a bottle hey
but now you got me drunk out that pain gone after sorrow
wishing every day you were here with me
but now that youre gone i lost my heart to the bottle to the bottle
ooh oh oh

not a day goes by that i dont miss ya and dont wish you were here with me
no matter what you did i forgive you

i lost my father to the bottle
tell your parents you love em
you might not see them tomorrow
i swallow my pride try to put my problems aside
but i feel so hollow inside
gotta keep my eyes on the prize
cause im steady wishing you were here
to see the goals that i plan to reach
you left the day after i put you into my grammy speech
its almost like you waited just to see me win
well pops i cant wait until the day we meet

if i had have know i wouldnt see you tomorrow
i wouldve had you hold to your heart and put your love in a bottle hey
but now you got me drunk out that pain gone after sorrow
wishing every day you were here with me
but now that youre gone i lost my heart to the bottle to the bottle
ooh oh oh

long days half sober nights
unsigned performing at every open mic
god is all i needed to believe in me
haters i tune them out they were on another frequency
my mama never winded my decision
and all the bright lights never blinded out my vision

yeah what an imagination
im a dreamer losing my concentration
head in the clouds to trace my observations
just connect the dots to all of the constellations
looking for signs thats astrological
and i dont dream big my dreams are astronomical
so when critics write articles of my chronicles
i wonder if my hunger is felt and they abdominal
hiding from life daily distraction
where thoughts become things from the power of attraction
and im attracted to money and beautiful woman
ha and toasting to new beginnings yeah

if you look to the stars youll find that your not far from me
and if you follow your heart youll find that youll be one of them
and not long
and not long
and not long
and not long
and not long

look its not long til the fights over
the turbulence is non stop till the flights over
so when passengers panic just stay silent
and realize its never too late to become the pilot
i fly higher take control of my destiny
the first step i needed me to invest in me
its still an every day struggle for wealth
id rather struggle to working for me than working for someone else
and im steady tryna ease the stress
so i open up all the doors with the key to success
if it hasnt been done then imma do it first
cause im the master of the ludaverse

if you look to the stars youll find that your not far from me
and if you follow your heart youll find that youll be one of them
