i met her when i was young and she was younger
with a body like woman so her age meant nothing
i had to get her number
after how she made them daisy doots fit her all summer
im wishing i could hit her all summer

and all she ever wanted
was for young weezy to love her
but all i ever wanted was to cum easy and dump her
but that didnt come easy
cuz she ended up being my babys mother

and then i felt smothered but little did i know
id never find the same girl inside another
but i never thought that id be looking for her
and i never thought that late at night
when im in the mix laying down with some chick
that suddenly itll click

how this broad in my drawers dont know shit

whens theres a woman with my kid where i should be
she screamed to me

and she aint even like me but i got her after the game
mami was a nice piece young cali sweet thang

it was going good i was happy again
but then things got rapidly strange and it had to be wayne
she was still a virgin what more could i ask from a dame
but i was a bastard i asked for the pain
now my ass in the rain

and she got a new life the picture flipped
and none of it includes weezy and all his bullshit
and i remember the bahamas for the weekend
we was freaking in the suite
and she looked sweet enough to beat it up

till we began to sleep and i
im dreaming bout the victoria secret lingerie
told me keep it she aint want moms to see it
and just think i once saw it on the girls body
now all im seeing is nobody

look-
now when i crawl up out the rove i got quarters and os
forty-fours under my clothes – im drunk and blow
and i done told them boys if they play i dump their mothers
now they findin niggas everyday slumped in gutters
i come through on the block strapped bumpin bubba
for the summer in a bright orange pumpkin hummer
stumblin’ from the courvoisier and lots of hay
and make me run in your place and take your pops away
see they got niggas in my hood who cant cop the yay
so i can get it understood and have you chopped today
and not to say i could even hit your block and spray
and try to knock all the bone structure out your face
stick a potato on the head of my nine – its deadly quiet
leave a nigga redder than swine you damn pig
the plan is to take everything and kill em all
young or old nigga big or small
aint nothin nice

[hook lil wayne]
aint nothin nice around here stupid

and in the van theres a box in the back full of plenty of tools
and when you see me on the block i come to give em the blues

[lil wayne]
look-
now we all do dumb things
playin with wayne doesnt have to be one of em

i got two double desert eagles bustin at your peoples
cussin at polices and roughin up your nieces

and im hangin out the beamer top releasin shots

creep up in your window while youre sleepin take your child with me
im wild and wheezy more violent than dennis rodman

im a hoosier usually the cool one
but when i need it i turn into a looter
god forgive but do he forgive the brutal

good morning doctor carter hey sweetie
looks like its going to be a long day ahh another one what we got
your first patient yeah
is suffering from a lack of concept uh-huh
originality ugh
his flow is weak another one
and he has no style ugh
whatcha got for um

verse 1 lil wayne
ok let me put my gloves on
and my scrubs on
drcarter to the rescue
excuse me if im late
but like a thief it takes time to be this great
honestly just wait 
your style is a disgrace your rhymes are fifth place and im just grace
one uno ace and im tryin to make your heart beat like bass
but your sweet like cake and i come to fix whatever you shall break 
where is your originality you are so fake
so picture me like a gallery- capture what i say
all i need is one mic all i need is one take
like hey brighter than the sun ray got a pistols on the playground
watch the gunplay like no kidding no kids in the way
but the kids do watch gotta watch what we say gotta work everyday
gotta not be cliche
gotta stand out like andre 3k
gotta kick it kick it like a sensai
you gotta have faith you gotta gotta wait wait

i think i i think i lost him dial one eighteen please

nurse
good afternoon dr carter
i dont know about this one
his confidence is down
vocab and metaphors need work
and he lost respect for the game aaahhhhh lemme see

you think you can save him


verse 2 lil wayne
okay respect is in the heart
so thats where ima start
and a lot of heart patients dont make it
now hey kids-- plural-- i graduated
cause you could get through anything if magic made it
and that was called recycling
or rereciting
something cause you just like it
so you say it just like it
some say its biting
but i say its enlightening
besides dr kanye west is one of the brightest
and dr swizz can stitch your track up the tightest
and dr jeezy can fix your back up the nicest
arthritis in my hand from writing
but ima doctor they dont understand my writing
so i stop writing
now im like lightning
and you aint fish young so dont clash with the titans
fast and exciting
my passion is frightening
now let me put some more vocab in your iv
here take this vicodin
like it and love it
and confidence has no budget so pay me no mine i dont walk like i talk it cause im running i dont do it cause i done it and im in the emergency punnet

goddamn it ive lost another one

nurse
good evening dr carter its been a long day
but this one looks much better than the others
his respect is back up his concepts sound good 
his style is showing strong signs of improvement
all he needs now is his swagger ok lemme take my gloves off then

verse 3 lil wayne
swagger tighter than a yeast infection
fly go hard like geast erection
fashion patrol police detection
i stay tight like chinese connection
i stay tight like pussy at night
baby dont get me wrong i could do that pussy right
but im to wrong to write
to fresh to fight
to paid to freestyle
to paid to freestyle
i had to say it twice
swagger so nice
and dont ask me shit unless it concern a price
and i dont rap fast i rap slow
cause i mean every letter in the words in the setence of my quotes
swagger just flow sweeter than honey oats
that swagger i got it i wear it like a coat
wait as i put the light down his throat
i can only see flow
his blood starting to flow
his lungs starting to grow
this one starting to show
strong signs of life
wheres the stiches heres the knife
smack his face his eyes open
i reply with a nice welcome back
hip hop i saved your lifethis is x4
we are not the same i am a martian martian…

verse 1
lil wayne
yeah some say tragedy is hard to get over
but sometimes that tragedy means its over
soldier from the academy league of rollers
i deny being down
though they seem to hold us
my shoulders is strong i prove ‘em wrong
i aint doing nothing but moving on
let the truth be known
but they talk that freedom matters
and didnt even leave a ladder damn

robin thicke
i work at the corner store
we all got problems problems

verse 2
i knock on the door
hope isnt home
fates not around
the lucks so gone
dont ask me whats wrong

and im a tell you whats life
and did you know i lost everything
but i aint the only one
first came the hurricane then the morning sun
excuse me if im on one
and dont trip if i light one
i walk a tight one
they try tell me keep my eyes open
my whole city under water
some people still floatin
and they wonder why black people still votin
‘cause your presidents still joking
take away the football team
the basketball team
now all we got is me to represent new orleans
no governor no help from the mayor
just a steady beatin heart
and a wish and a prayer
lets pray

robin thicke
these friends come and go
but i got family family
these kids so fast they grow
they learn so quickly now
but theres nowhere to go 
but theres some future future
dont make this seem so low
and we cant overcome yo

chorus

verse 3
and if ya come from under that water
then theres fresh air
just breath baby
gods got a blessing ta spare
yes i know that the process is so much stress
but its tha progress that feels the best
‘cause i came from tha projects
straight ta success and your next
so try they cant steal your pride its inside
then find it and keep on grindin
‘cause in every dark cloud theres a silver lining
i know

a shot in the dark
we aint trying nothing but be at the heart
we need love

perry mason facing the barrel if he tattle

fucking fantastic fuck if you agree im bright
but i dont give a fuck if you see me

[chorus]
im just a soul whose intentions are good
oh lord please dont let me be misunderstood

my mama say fuck em and we the same
so hello mothafucka you got some sheets to change
and aint it funny how people change like easter sunday
you know church fit then outfit
bright pink and green chest look house lit
bright pinky rings but that aint about this
what you bout bitch
excuse my french emotion in my passion
but i wear my heart on my sleeve like its the new fashion
what are you asking if i dont have the answer
its probably on the web like im a damn tarantula
but i know you dont understand
cause you thought lil wayne was weezy
but weezy is dwayne

[chorus]

i was watching tv the other day right
got this white guy on there
talking about black guys
talking about how young black guys are targeted
targeted by who america
you see one in every hundred americans are locked up
one in every nine black americans are locked up
and see what the white guy was trying to stress was that
the money we spend on sending a mothafucka to jail
a young mothafucka to jail
would be less to send his or her young ass to college
see and another thing the white guy was stressing was that
our jails are populated with drug dealers
you know crack cocaine yea stuff like that
meaning due to the laws we have on crack cocaine and regular cocaine
police are only i dont want to say only right but shit
only logic by riding around in the hood all day
and not in the suburbs
because crack cocaine is mostly found in the hood
and you know the other thing is mostly found in you know where im going
but why bring a mothafucka to jail if its not gon stand up in court
cause this drug aint that drug
you know level three level four drug shit like that
i guess its all a misunderstanding
i sit back and think you know us young mothafuckas you know that 1 in 9
we probably only selling the crack cocaine because we in the hood
and its not like in the suburbs we dont have what you have
why i really dont wanna know the answer
i guess we just misunderstood huh
you know we dont have room in the jail now for the real mothafuckas
the real criminals
sex offenders rapists serial killers
dont get scared dont get scared
i know you saw one them sex offenders papers
dont trip he live right on the end of yo block
mhm yea that nigga live right down the street from you
sex offender on the level three drug
convicted ex-con
yea check em out
watch you got you got a daughter son what you got
ha ha yea you know what
thats the good weed
you know what i have a fucking daughter
you understand me and why the fuck would you bring my neighbor to jail
just because the reason why he live next door to me
aint the reason i live next door to him
meaning he didnt rap his way to my fucking neighborhood
he sold crack cocaine to get to my neighborhood
you move him out bring him to jail for life
and then you move in with a sex offender
ha ha hey give me a paper
ha ha is that a misunderstanding because i didnt understand it
another thing let me take my glasses off
cause i wanna see the reaction on there faces when i say this
ha ha this is why i dont respect you and nobody like ya
see youre the type that gets off on getting on other people
thats not good
no homo
rather un-human i should say
i mean giving the fact that humanity were a good humanity
rather to me is helping one another
no matter your color or race
but this guy and people like him
theyd rather speculate before they informate
if thats a word ha ha ha you know spec before check
anyways meaning id much rather
you talk to me first and see if you can lend an opinion before you link one
just my thought of good humanity
mr sharpton hold on i aint finished with you man
na fuck that shit mhm hold on um
mr sharp ton and anyone like you you dont know me
so if your not going to try to then what you say or think about me
are what ever i do is totally casper the friendly ghost
to me and it doesnt make you a good person
to criticize before you improvise
doesnt necessarily make you a bad person either
but the characteristics for heavenly into bads way
haha but since i am human i am good and bad
as well but i try my hardest to stay good
threes other things i do and say may be bad or just not to good
but i do try so with that said i dont vote you
i mean your only human good or bad
but i also dont respect you and i dont care if thats good or bad
you see you are no mlk you are no jesse jackson
you are nobody to me your just another don king
with a perm haha just a little more political
and that just means youre a little un-human
then use humans and now let me be human and say
fuck al sharpton and anyone like him
fuck if you understand me
i love being misunderstood
ha ha why
cause i live in the suburbs
but i come from the hood
bring the hook in

and you can get tipped like

i give my all behind the mic 
but you could never see if you 
sit behind the light 
you dont have to pick me 
to win the title fight 
but ima wear that 
championship belt so tight 
and if im wrong there is no right 
and if im wrong there is no white 
im triin to be polite 
but you bitches in my hair 
like the fuckin po-lice 
my flow is rare 
these other rappers nice 
these other rappers bark 
some of them even bite 
but im much more bright 
i give the game sight 
so before you dim the light 
you just might might wanna 

think it over think it over 
ooo think it over baby 
stop 

stop analyzing 
criticizing 
you should realize 
what i am n start epitomizing

and made it to greedy

i set behind her every year 
waiting for the chance to get 
to tell her im the one she should be with 
shes popular with all the guys 
so innocent in my eyes
i could see her in my life 
she wouldve had the world if she was mine

but see she had other plans 
i couldnt understand 
her and her stupid friends 
varsitys biggest fans 
never forget the day 
she laughed and walked away 
and i couldnt stop her 
i guess she had it all 

she had it all figured out 
but she left me with a broken heart 
fucked around and turned me down 
cause she didnt think i could play the part 
but now the prom queenthe prom queen 
is crying sitting outside of my door 
she you never know how 
how everything could turn around 


uhh 
they loved her fancy underwear 
every boyfriend every year 
she tried to keep em entertained 
when they can hardly remember her name 
she did everything she could just to 
to make him love and treat her good 
just to find herself alone 
asking herself where did she go wrong-ong-ong

she didnt realise 
she chased the type of guys 
that dont believe in ties 
trying to apologise 
never forget the day 
she laughed and walked away 
and i couldnt stop her 
i guess she had it all

she had it all figured out 
but she left me with a broken heart 
fucked around and turned me down 
cause she didnt think i could play the part 
but now the prom queenthe prom queen 
is crying sitting outside of my door 
she you never know how 
how everything could turn around

fucked around and turned me down 
cause she didnt think i could play the part 
but now the prom queenthe prom queen 
is crying sitting outside of my door 
she you never know how 
how everything could turn aroundback the hell off

when everybody knew your move and the games you played
she finally made all her dreams come true and then she screamed
