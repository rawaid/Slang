for those of you that want to know what were all about
its like this yall come on

this is 10% luck
20% skill
15% concentrated power of will
5% pleasure
50% pain
and a 100% reason
to remember the name

mike
he doesnt need his name up in lights
he just wants to be heard
whether its the beat or the mike
he feels so unlike
everybody else alone
in spite of the fact
that some people still think
that they know him
but fuck them
he knows the code
its not about the salary
its all about reality
and making some noise
making the story
making sure his clique stays up
that means when he puts it down
taks picking it up
lets go

who the hell is he anyway
he never really talks much
never concerned with status
but still leaving them star struck
humbled through opportunities
given to him despite the fact
that many misjudge him
because he makes a living from writing raps
put it together himself
now the picture connects
never asking for someones help
or to get some respect
hes only focused on what he wrote
his will is beyond reach
and now when it all unfolds
the skill of an artist

its just 20% skill
80% beer
be 100% clear
because ryu is ill
who wouldve thought that
hed be the one to set the west in flames
and i heard him wrecking with
the crystal methods name of the game
came back dropped megadef
took them to church
i like bleach man
ryu had the stupidest verse
this dude is the truth
now everybody be giving him guest spots
his stocks through the roof
i heard he fucking with s dot

this is 10% luck
20% skill
15% concentrated power of will
5% pleasure
50% pain
and a 100% reason
to remember the name

they call him ryu the sick
and hes spitting fire with mike
got him out the dryer hes hot
found him in fort minor with tak
been a fucking an nihilist porcupine
hes a prick hes a cock
the type woman want to be with
and rappers hope he get shot
8 years in the making
patiently waiting to blow
now the record with
shinodas taking over the globe
hes got a partner in crime
his shit is equally dope
you wont believe the kind of shit
that comes out of this kids throat

tak
hes not your everyday on the block
he knows how to work with what hes got
making his way to the top
people think its a common owners name
people keep asking him was it given at birth
or does it stand for an acronym no
hes living proof
got him rocking the booth
hell get you buzzing quicker than a shot of vodka with juice
him and his crew are known around as one of the best
dedicated to what they doing
give a 100%

forget mike
nobody really knows how or why
he works so hard
it seems like hes never got time
because he writes every note
and he writes every line
and ive seen him at work
when that light goes on in his mind
its like a design
is written in his head every time
before he even touches a key
or speaks in a rhyme
and those mother fuckers he runs with
those kids that he signed
ridiculous without even trying
how do they do it

this is 10% luck
20% skill
15% concentrated power of will
5% pleasure
50% pain
and a 100% reason
to remember the namehey joe a-were you goin with that gun in your hand

i use to write in every color i think in
to paint a picture with every rhyme that i speak in
yeah the gallery is the beat then i i i i

yes ladies and gentlemen
we have a special guest for you this evening
ghost you ready

yo i verbally paint pictures im the hoods best storyteller
this about a young boy dealing with the older fellas
promised him the lives you see on tv
he ran packs across town like rhyme cds
and big chains new clothes nikes and reeboks
stacking too much loot to squeeze in a shoe box
saving he promised his mom a crib in atlanta
and his pops got killed through debt he was a dealer
so he staged jazz fox jump off the suit cases
no more cross-town now hes crossing them states and
seeing new faces not knowing who to trust
so when the door kicked open they scream this is a bust
is it a set up it seems funny a scuffle broke out
he got hit dropped the cases spitting blood out of his mouth
he walked four blocks to die trying to survive
and now all thats left is his mom screaming god why

uh spraypaint and ink pens
i use to write in every color i think in
to paint a picture with every rhyme that i speak in
yeah the gallery is the beat then i i i i

yeah yeah let me begin by saying shut the fuck up
let my begin by saying i dont think this man knew what he had in store
he opened the door and found the bag under the floor
not a peep always working a lot get the flame aim pop
open the box and take off out the back of the pawn shop
scoping the lot hoping the cops hadnt seen the plates on his car
he felt like he been hustling so hard like a demon he pumped a cold heart
play it cool like humphrey bogart put the rings on his chain attached by both parts
he did the drop one ring in a bag envelope all the money he had
left the money and the ring in a slow exhale
two weeks went by got a box in the mail
in the box was a bullet made of gold
melted down from the ring recast with two rings and a band
and he stared at it sitting in the palm of his hand
and sat down next to a picture that sat on the nightstand
it was his wife in the picture on his side
with the ring on the finger on the week that she died
as he looked in the reflection at those eyes so red
he put the bullet in a gun and put it right in his head like that

uh spraypaint and ink pens
i use to write in every color i think in
to paint a picture with every rhyme that i speak in
yeah the gallery is the beat then i i i i
uh yeah uh

fiasco

you know he didnt have enough power in his thrusters to muster warp 5
plus if he pushed it the fuel cells could rupture then they would die
then the galaxy would suffer but he knew he had to try
but he couldnt risk it put the cure in the escape pod and kissed it
and told her goodbye she started to cry but he knew if he could distract em
he could buy her some time and she could make it out alive
turn the suit around and got prepared for the stand off
space mind had blew one of the hands off
damaged laser cannons and he got the system jammed
and he faced the whole fleet blood seeping through his teeth
the final saga in the seven planet wars
unsheethed the sword and then he charged forward
his eyes flashed behind the cracked cockpit glass
he let out a laugh and then all she heard was a blast like

uh spraypaint and ink pens
i use to write in every color i think in
to paint a picture with every rhyme that i speak in
yeah the gallery is the beat then i i i i

yeah ladies and gentlemen

i dont play that like rap in a rednecks house
i can have your brain cells spinning quicker than speedwells
your female email and me on your details
i dont dig up dirt i shake the earth
and i never say names i wouldnt waste the verse
all for the top im hot and when they dare me to write
prepare to carry your mic to a burial site
im a pioneer fucking up stereotypes
i snatched chains as a kid made you carry your bikes
i got an addiction to spitting shit its heroin like
storytellers speak of telling me american plight
money blows funny though it seems embarrassing right
rock shows blow the doors on a pair of air nikes
all night

yeah yo you know the rules i cruise with a tough band
you in the fucking closet with brooms and a dustpan

my soul will make a ouiji board jump up and slap you dummy
you not thinking smart
i bust so many blamers and blinkers that i should start a rock band called blinking spark
sinking sharks with no harpoons my arsenal is a sawblade carved in two sliding your coffin through
apathy is insane and im the same as my brother
im like a circus show sniper i aim for the juggler
catch a case and before the judge could slam down the gavel
the whole room ducking and hide from grenade shrapnel

just rollin with the rhythm
rise from the ashes of stylistic division
with these nonstop lyrics of life-livin

who wanna talk this and that so i suppose
it gets to a point where feelings gotta get hurt
and get dirty with the people spreadin the dirt
its like

i try to give you warning but everyone ignores me
i told you niggas nine ten times stop fuckin with me
but nobodys listening
call to you so clearly but you dont want to hear me
i told you niggas nine ten times stop fuckin with me
but nobodys listening

i got a heart full of pain head full of stress
handful of anger held in my chest
and everything lefts a waste of time
i hate my rhymes but hate everyone elses more
im ridin on the back of this pressure
guessin that its better i cant keep myself together
cause all of this stress gave me somethin to write on
the pain gave me somethin i could set my sights on
you never forget the blood sweat and tears
the uphill struggle over years
the fear and trash talkin and the people it was to
what up to the militia and the lpu

i try to give you warning but everyone ignores me
i told you niggas nine ten times stop fuckin with me
but nobodys listening
call to you so clearly but you dont want to hear me
i told you niggas nine ten times stop fuckin with me

this is 10% luck
20% skill
15% concentrated power of will
5% pleasure
50% pain
and a 100% reason
to remember the name

mike
he doesnt need his name up in lights
he just wants to be heard
whether its the beat or the mike
he feels so unlike
everybody else alone
in spite of the fact
that some people still think
that they know him
but fuck them
he knows the code
its not about the salary
its all about reality
and making some noise
making the story
making sure his clique stays up
that means when he puts it down
taks picking it up
lets go

who the hell is he anyway
he never really talks much
never concerned with status
but still leaving them star struck
humbled through opportunities
given to him despite the fact
that many misjudge him
because he makes a living from writing raps
put it together himself
now the picture connects
never asking for someones help
or to get some respect
hes only focused on what he wrote
his will is beyond reach
and now when it all unfolds
the skill of an artist

its just 20% skill
80% fear
be 100% clear
because ryu is ill
who wouldve thought that
hed be the one to set the west in flames
and i heard him wrecking with
the crystal methods name of the game
came back dropped megadef
took them to church
i like bleach man
ryu had the stupidest verse
this dude is the truth
now everybody be giving him guest spots
his stocks through the roof
i heard he fucking with s dot

this is 10% luck
20% skill
15% concentrated power of will
5% pleasure
50% pain
and a 100% reason
to remember the name

they call him ryu the sick
and hes spitting fire with mike
got him out the dryer hes hot
found him in fort minor with tak
been a fucking an nihilist porcupine
hes a prick hes a cock
the type woman want to be with
and rappers hope he get shot
8 years in the making
patiently waiting to blow
now the record with
shinodas taking over the globe
hes got a partner in crime
his shit is equally dope
you wont believe the kind of shit
that comes out of this kids throat

tak
hes not your everyday on the block
he knows how to work with what hes got
making his way to the top
people think its a common owners name
people keep asking him was it given at birth
or does it stand for an acronym no
hes living proof
got him rocking the booth
hell get you buzzing quicker than a shot of vodka with juice
him and his crew are known around as one of the best
dedicated to what they doing
give a 100%

forget mike
nobody really knows how or why
he works so hard
it seems like hes never got time
because he writes every note
and he writes every line
and ive seen him at work
when that light goes on in his mind
its like a design
is written in his head every time
before he even touches a key
or speaks in a rhyme
and those mother fuckers he runs with
those kids that he signed
ridiculous without even trying
how do they do it

this is 10% luck
20% skill

machine shopsomeone right now is leaving their apartment
looking down at the street and wondering where their car went
someone in the car sitting at a signal
in front of a restaurant staring through the window

at someone right now with their finger in their teeth
who could use a little floss right across the street
theres somebody on the curb who really needs a jacket
but spent half the rent at a bar getting plastered

now hes gotta walk fourteen blocks
just to work at a shop where hes about to get fired
someone right now is looking pretty tired
staring at a laptop trying to get inspired

as somebody living right across the street
just wrote the best thing that shes written all week
but her best friends coughing up blood in the sink
he cant even think what happened feeling so confused
and he knows it looks bad but theres nothing he can do
i wonder what its like to be right there in his shoes but

yo im just taking it in
out the window of a hotel bedroom again
tomorrow ill be gone i dont know when ill be back
but in this world everything can change just like that like that

yo somebody right now is dropping his vote
inside a box and trying to not get shot in his throat
for the act of freedom right now somebodys stuck in iraq
hoping that he gets shipped back breathing

in a war but hes not really sure the reasons
so we show our support when the press mislead him
though we mourn remain proud salute the troops
get some i know you boys got some work to do

meanwhile right now someones 25-to-life-ing
standing on a corner with their thumb up hitchhiking
scratching off a lotto ticket hoping for a real winner
sneaking through the border just to work and eat a real dinner

right now someone wishes they were you and i
instead of second-guessing fatal thoughts of quiet suicide
but right now im staring at the window at a frame
with holes in his arm and holes in his jeans
he pulled out a cigarette and sparked the light 
and walked right around the corner just outta my sight but

yo im just taking it in
from the second story hotel window again
the tvs on and my bags are packed
but in this world everything can change just like that like that

yo im just taking it in
from the second story hotel window again
the tvs on and my bags are packed
but in this world everything can change just like that like that

yeah right now somebodys sittin in the darkness
tryin to figure how to put some heat in their apartment
but they got a little mattress little carpet
and they appreciate it cause some people on a park bench

you see em when you rushing to get to the office
wife robbed blind when she coming from the market
right now somebody comin out the pocket
tryin to dump that rock they runnin round the block with

the same time the cops is raising the glock with aim
to fill your legs and your back with some hot shit
right now somebodys struggling to stop this man
whos kicking and punching and cussing at the doctors

down the hall a child takin its first breath
the doctors aint even passed him to the nurse yet yo
i wonder if he understands what its worth yet
life the time spent while we here on the earth yet

the answers to the questions we all seek
can be found it depend on how free yall think
right now its somebody who aint eat all week
that would kill for the shit you throw away in the street

i guess ones mans trash is the next mans treasure
one mans pain is the next mans pleasure
one say infinity the next say forever
right now everybody got to get it together man

in another strange hotel lobby again

machine shopyeah these days are dark and the nights are cold
people acting like they lost their soul
and everywhere i go i see another person like me
trying to make it all feel like home feel like home

these days are dark and the nights are cold
people acting like they lost their soul
and everywhere i go i see another person like me
trying to make it all feel like home feel like home

standing on the bridge in the dark and im seeing my breath
trying to make it home without freezing to death
and my grandfathers face is stuck in my mind mind and how
seeing him tonights gonna be the last time

i shouldve brought a jacket
blowing in my hands like its really gonna stop the chill
i buy a cup of coffee with a five dollar bill
thinking layin in that box people look so still

at times like these you start thinkin
your first breath in and the clock starts tickin
im not trying to bum anyone out
not trying to be dramatic just thinking out loud

im just trying to make some sense in my mind
some defence from the cold that im feeling outside
and for a minute escape with some rhythm and rhyme 
and get away from the grey just a bit of the time

yeah kinda funny how this world can treat you
like a freak in a sideshow a carnival creature
climbing outta cans im a diamond in the sand
but you cant tell the difference on a beach full of rhinestones

my lifes like trying to swallow a pine cone
its tough when you live fast just to die slow
talk to dial tones my dreams are far fetched
it seems so i sleep underneath this park bench

i know it dont make sense
and i dont expect for you to know what its like
smoke drink piss sniffing everything in my sight
push rocks in a pipe
liftoff i keep puffin til my lips turn white

and my chest gets tight but who the fuck really cares
when youre so far left that even death looks right
all i can do is hope for the best and pray
that it gets a little better than yesterday these

these days are dark and the nights are cold
people acting like they lost their soul
and everywhere i go i see another person like me
trying to make it all feel like home feel like home

these days are dark and the nights are cold
people acting like they lost their soul
and everywhere i go i see another person like me
trying to make it all feel like home feel like home

yo pardon me i think im next to url
too many problems going on thats why i left my girl
packed my bags and i traveled with a pen and my notepad
pissed that i was broke and all the things that i dont have

but still i try to find a way to escape
from all the hate planted in my head which lead to mistakes
but now im breaking the mold see i was patient and calm
many sleep in the rain but im awake in the storm

writing my life in a short film the rise and fall
how i managed to scorch hills and climb the walls
pound pavement aimless in this cold existence
even though things are changing im going the distance

overcoming the doubt that had control for so long
and put it all behind me cause life still goes on
now im much stronger and know where i stand
while lost souls search over and over again

these days are dark and the nights are cold
people acting like they lost their soul
and everybodys trying not to cry trying to get by
and trying not to feel out of control out of control

and if you look hard enough
sometimes youll find a place
that might just remind you of home
but if it doesnt feel like home
you can do what i do
just pretend you dont feel so alone so alone

feel like home feel like home
feel like home feel like home
feel like home feel like home
feel like home feel like home

feel like home feel like home
feel like home feel like home
feel like home feel like home
feel like home feel like homewhered you go
i miss you so
seems like its been forever
that youve been gone

she said some days i feel like shit
some days i wanna quit and just be normal for a bit
i dont understand why you have to always be gone
i get along but the trips always feel so long

and i find myself trying to stay by the phone
cause your voice always helps me to not feel so alone
but i feel like an idiot workin my day around the call
but when i pick up i dont have much to say

so i want you to know its a little fucked up
that im stuck here waitin at times debatin
tellin you that ive had it with you and your career
me and the rest of the family here singing whered you go

whered you go
i miss you so
seems like its been forever
that youve been gone

whered you go
i miss you so

that youve been gone
please come back home

come back home you know the place where you used to live
used to barbecue up burgers and ribs
used to have a little party every halloween with candy by the pile
but now you only stop by every once and a while

shit i find myself just fillin my time
with anything to keep the thought of you from my mind
im doin fine and im plannin to keep it that way
you can call me if you find that you have something to say

and ill tell you i want you to know its a little fucked up

for why youre not around and feeling so useless

this is how it goes
welcome one and all to the show
were wired up
fired up
fucking ready to go
in the back of the parking lot outside of the bar
twenty deep
twenty feet from the boulevard
black hoodies
black caps
black label in glasses
previewing the new shit before the masses
cause the first thing i need when ive got a new beat
is to see how it sounds
echoing off the street
i just take it for a spin
pop the cd in
slide it up to ten and get that rearview shaking
then play it again so theres no mistaking
san andreas the block
get this bitch earthquaking like

oh
ready for it here we go
we got the whole block rocking in stereo
were taking control
letting everybody know
and if you feel it
let me hear everybody go

youre not ready
i got plenty cuts for twenty months dropped steadily
plenty tracks to empty on your wack pedigree
im backed heavily while youre back peddling
forget the chitchat on me homie
kick back
im on that shit that can get your homie bitch-slapped
so zip your lip back
listen and watch
we got the whole block rockin off the way the beat knocks
you dont have to warn the people on the corner
they know
that if youre standing on that corner then youre getting that show
world premiering youre hearing that machine shop flow
san andreas the block
get this bitch earthquaking like

oh
ready for it here we go
we got the whole block rocking in stereo
were taking control
letting everybody know
and if you feel it
let me hear everybody go

turn the key
turn the volume up to loud
roll right
roll every window down
let the whole block know what this is about
turn it up yall
burn that system outback home
everybodys searching for somethin
but all they can find is a whole lot of nothin
back home
aint nobody hoping and praying
cause they feel like nothing can save em
and they try to hold out but they cant fight the fact that
life goes black when those lights go out
but i guess you gotta just watch out for your own
cause aint a damn thing free
back home

common
back home
they holler disciple and blackstone
same block they freebase yo we trapped on
where our grandmothers marched
the guns clap on
theres liquor stores beauty supplies and rap songs
i travel the world just to come back to it
the crib got a lot of soul like black music
im attached to it
in many ways the city raised me
and gave me
the drama honor and bravery
the streets seem hollow
when i go to chicago
its cheap wine and sorrow
times is hard to swallow
in search of gods tomorrow
i borrow words from the
bible
and use them for survival
gangs rival
signs painted on walls like hieroglyphics
i tell em that this is all tribal
used to do dirt
shortys goin through the same cycle
and trials like michael
tryin not to stay idle

ryu
back home its not compton but close
the same problems exist and the pain throbbin
and folks are so common
it dont
really bother us much we just swallow it
uh
crack the bottle and smoke
hope tomorrow something
magical happens thatll put me back in the biz
but the chances of it actually happenings kinda slim
back home
we get the good life at a glimpse
in the form of a rap star drug dealers and pimps
im back home

tak
back home
i try my best to keep it together its cold
like the windy city streets of december
i pace back and forth
looking for the courage to shine
but cant tap the source
need something to nourish my mind
i know we all lose quite a bit in life
only to gain some
life of the dark winding roads we came from
but i move with the night
so im used to the shade
and never lose sight
bringing truth back to the game

mike
back home
weve got a lot of shit on our minds
were always behind on something cause theres not enough time
and were non-stop
bottom line
doing what we gotta do to get some food in the fridge and stay out of the hosptial
back home theres people calling us hopeless
people trying to tell us all we need is some focus
but focus
focus is overrated
cause you see every blemish and mistake and cant change it
back home is alvarado
k-town and j-town
or little tokyo for those that dont know
where figures shiver
living right in the litter where kids write bigger 
right inside the la river
on the concrete
a symbol of our everyday way
its that color and concentration over the heavy and grey
and by the time the ink dries on this page
ill be half a day away from the place where i stayyeah go ahead and uh cue the special effects

man i love this rap game mainly cause its cool
to add a little spice to the life youve been through
everyone exaggerates a tiny little bit
make that shit sound more gangster than it really is

you cant appear weak man we wanna hear street
we wanna hear you spit your thug over this here beat
dont take it as sarcastic i cant get enough
im tellin you you can call my bluff
if its not rough then i really dont need it

im not even ashamed
i got too much reality thats fillin up my brain
so sell me on that product im addicted to the game
suck it up like a cigarette light it up

its just like a cigarette its somethin that i do
once in a while but between me an you
its just like a cigarette nobodys really fooled
i dont want the truth i wanna feel fuckin cool

let me tell you something that i realized tonight
my hip hop radio is like marlboro lights
theyre both sellin stories and they sound about the same
cigarettes say theyre safe rappers claim they really bang

we dont care if its true when we lay the money down
we dont believe the words we just love the way they sound
theyre acting like were idiots theyre lyin to our face
maybe we are idiots we buy it anyway

im runnin out to get the next rappers cd
just suckin up the guns drugs and misogyny
the same way that i suck up all the stories when i breathe
that little bit of death supposedly cancer-free

and everything they says got the truth twisted up
but twisted ups what i want man i cant get enough
cause even though we know its all just a big bluff
we just light another up what we dont give a fuck

its just like a cigarette its somethin that i do
once in a while but between me an you
its just like a cigarette nobodys really fooled
i dont want the truth i wanna feel fuckin cool

its just like a cigarette its somethin that i do
over and over but between me an you
its just like a cigarette nobodys really fooled
i dont want the truth i wanna feel fuckin cool

man listen to my words listen for a while
lip service radio dont touch the dial
if youre in the car turn up the track man
give your whole neighborhood some second-hand rap

hey matter of fact listen for a while
lip service radio dont touch the dial
if youre in the car man turn up the track
and give the whole neighborhood some second-hand rap

its just like a cigarette its somethin that i do
once in a while but between me an you
its just like a cigarette nobodys really fooled
i dont want the truth i wanna feel fuckin cool

its just like a cigarette its somethin that i do
over and over but between me an you
its just like a cigarette nobodys really fooled
i dont want the truth i wanna feel fuckin cooli guess that this is where weve come to
if you dont want to then you dont have to believe me
but i wont be there when you go down
just so you know now youre on your own now believe me

yo i dont wanna be the one to blame
you like fun and games keep playin em im just sayin
think back then we was like one and the same
on the right track but i was on the wrong train

its like that now you gotta face the pain
and the devils got a fresh new place to play
in your brain like a maze you can never escape
the rain every damn days the same shade of grey

hey i used to have a little bit of a plan
used to have a concept of where i stand
but that concept slipped right outta my hand
now i dont really even know who i am

yo what do i have to say maybe
i should do what i have to do to break free and
whatever happens to you well see
but its not gonna happen with me

i guess that this is where weve come to
if you dont want to then you dont have to believe me
but i wont be there when you go down
just so you know now youre on your own now believe me

back then i thought you were just like me
somebody who could see all the pain i see
but you proved to me unintentionally
that you would self-destruct eventually

now im thinkin like the mistake i made doesnt hurt
but its not gonna work cause its really much worse than i thought
i wished you were something you were not
and now this guilt is really all that ive got

you turned your back and walk away ashamed
all you got is a memory and pain
nothing makes sense so you stare at the ground
and hear my voice in your head when no one else is around

so what do i have to say maybe
i should do what i have to do to break free and
whatever happens to you well see
but its not gonna happen with me

i guess that this is where weve come to
if you dont want to then you dont have to believe me
but i wont be there when you go down
just so you know now youre on your own now believe me

yeah
lets go

i guess that this is where weve come to
if you dont want to then you dont have to believe me
but i wont be there when you go down
just so you know now youre on your own now believe me

im doin what i have to do
youre on your own now believe me
whatever happens to you
youre on your own now believe me

what do i have to say
youre on your own now believe me
its not gonna happen with me
youre on your own now believe methe dude he said that like when we were making the first linkin park record
he was like
yeah you know i dont know about the rapping like i dont know if its like maybe you should just be a rock band
you know what i mean like trying to change us
like they signed us as an act like what we sound like and then hes like
oh i dont know maybe you should just play keyboard

before the first song that you heard me on
there were people already tryin to get me gone
tellin me to quit rapping
just play the keys
that my band had a singer
they didnt need me
but my band had my back
so we did the tracks
put out the album and the talk went flat
it was funny at first but then the humor faded
when some magazines printed that our label made us
we were to be good to be true
some were saying ghost writers were writin all that we do
so we had to disprove it
we spelled it out to the detail how we do it when were making this music
after that i made it a rule
i only do e-mail responses to print interviews
because these people love to put a twist to your words
to infer that you said something fuckin absurd

oh did i lose you at infer
not used to hearing a verse that uses over first grade vocabulary words
people used to infer that we were manufactured
now ive got the interviews on file
which people said what
which number to dial
so now every enemy screaming insanity
all theyre ever gonna bes another big fan of me
bitch

laughter

do you believe that like that was crazy
sounds crazy right
like this point at this point
your thinking you hear it out
your like that guy was out of his mind
but honestly at that point i mean
besides the fact that he wanted me to just
play keyboard or whatever didnt want me to rap
he was like maybe joe hahn should uhhm
wear a lab-coat and a cowboy hat on st like when we play
i swear to god he was crazy
yeah and later on he claimed that he wrote all our songs
so that was that was really nicelets go yall

these people are running off at the mouth
tryin to convince me that im running on empty
tryin to convince themselves that the record with jay was a fluke
that the record that im makin is a mistake
and i cant take this
lemme tell you where im at with this
you bastards are gonna have to take back that shit
im not plastic and fake
when i make tracks i take facts and lay them out for the masses
you assholes are gonna see soon that im not playin
start askin me the names that im not sayin
but im tryin to be bigger than the bickerin
bigger than the petty name callin
under the breath talkin
rumors and labels and categorization
im like a struggling doctor no patients
but you can say what you want about me
keep talkin while im walkin away

you can say what you have to say
cause my minds made up anyway
im taking the high road going above you
this is the last time that im gonna trust you
you can say what you have to say
cause my minds made up anyway
all that bullshit you talk might work a lot
but its not gonna work today

you people are running off at the mouth
tryin to make me take myself off safety
tryin to make my friends turn their backs on the team we built
buildin up some mistaken information
and i cant take this
lemme spell it out plain for you
angry groups complain about the things we do
im not changing direction im stepping my game up
maintainin my name the same way i came up
youre gonna see that im not playin
start asking the names that im not sayin
but im tryin not to mention the names of people who wanna siphon attention
you like the hype but pretendin youre part of the picture wont pass
youre like a high school dropout no class
you can say what you want about me
keep talkin while im walkin away bitch

you can say what you have to say
cause my minds made up anyway
im taking the high road going above you
this is the last time that im gonna trust you
you can say what you have to say
cause my minds made up anyway
all that bullshit you talk might work a lot
but its not gonna work today

why does it always have to be
somebodys always watching me
all i really need is some room to breathe
is anybody out there listening
cause i cant stand to keep this in
all i really want ill say it again

you can say what you have to say
cause my minds made up anyway
im taking the high road going above you
this is the last time that im gonna trust you
you can say what you have to say
cause my minds made up anyway
all that bullshit you talk might work a lot
but its not gonna work todaymy father came from japan in 1905
he was 15 when he immigrated from japan
he he he worked until he was able to buy this patch
and build a store

let me tell you the story in the form of a dream
i dont know why i have to tell it but i know what it means
close your eyes just picture the scene
as i paint it for you it was world war ii
when this man named kenji woke up
ken was not a soldier
he was just a man with a family who owned a store in la

that day he crawled out of bed like he always did
bacon and eggs with wife and kids
he lived on the second floor of a little store he ran
he moved to la from japan
they called him immigrant
in japanese hed say he was called issei
that meant first generation in the united states

when everyone was afraid of the germans afraid of the japs
but most of all afraid of a homeland attack
and that morning when ken went out on the doormat
his world went black cause
right there front page news three weeks before 1942
pearl harbours been bombed and the japs are comin

pictures of soldiers dyin and runnin
ken knew what it would lead to
just like he guessed the president said
the evil japanese in our home country will be locked away
they gave ken a couple of days
to get his whole life packed in two bags
just two bags couldnt even pack his clothes

some folks didnt even have a suitcase to pack anything in
so two trash bags was all they gave them
and when the kids asked mom where are we goin
nobody even knew what to say to them
ken didnt wanna lie he said the us is lookin for spies
so we have to live in a place called manzanar
where a lot of japanese people are

stop it dont look at the gunmen
you dont wanna get the soldiers wonderin
if you gonna run or not
cause if you run then you might get shot
other than that try not to think about it
try not to worry bout it bein so crowded
someday well get out someday someday

as soon as war broke out
the fbi came and they just come to the house and
you have to come
all the japanese have to go
they took mr lee
people didnt understand
why did they have to take him
because hes an innocent laborer

so now theyre in a town with soldiers surroundin them
every day every night look down at them
from watch towers up on the wall
ken couldnt really hate them at all
they were just doin their job and
he wasnt gonna make any problems

he had a little garden with vegetables and fruits that
he gave to the troops in a basket his wife made
but in the back of his mind he wanted his families life saved
prisoners of war in their own damn country what for

time passed in the prison town
he wanted if hed live it down if and when they were free
the only way out was joinin the army
and supposedly some men went out for the army signed on
and ended up flyin to japan with a bomb
that 15 kiloton blast put an end to the war pretty fast
two cities were blown to bits the end of the war came quick

ken got out big hopes of a normal life
wwith his kids and his wife but
when they got back to their home
what they saw made them feel so alone
these people had trashed every room
smashed in the windows and bashed in the doors
written on the walls and the floor
japs not welcome anymore

and kenji dropped both of his bags at his sides and just stood outside
he looked at his wife without words to say
she looked back at him wiped the tears away
and said someday well be okay someday

now the names have been changed but the storys true
my family was locked up back in 42
my family was there it was dark and damp
and they called it an internment camp

when we first got back from camp uhh
it was pretty pretty bad

i i remember my husband said
are we gonna stay til last
then my husband died before they close the campi had a friend named victor
the two of us used to hang every single day
and it seemed like overnight
that his whole life just changed
i know when his mom and dad broke up
it didnt make sense
but i know that his dad was a drunk
and he gambled away the rent

pretty soon vic was seeing red
pissed off but instead
hed drink every night til he passed out
and then hed do it all again
the whole time
smiling on the outside to cover the pain
but on the inside
all he was trying to do was get away

dying to get away
let the pain of yesterday
go slipping through the cracks

yo funny how things change color
then fade to another shade
when you had it made it was all good
but now look just another day
it was so fresh it was so clean
now its all gone one two three
lights out which way to turn
cant get a grip all alone in a big white house

every day gets worse
and you just curse til your head bursts
and it hurts so bad she left now you suffer
shouldve thought of that one first
no family no kids
cant accept what you did
now you wanna run away but you cant
cause the past comes back again

slippin through the cracks sip a little jack
go to bed half dead what about rent
why does every cent gotta be a bet
whens it gonna end
oh my god we dont got a penny left
my moms gotta find a way to get a job
outta debt outta dodge out of breath
out of this big problem

my pops wanna get away from the pain
in a better place in his brain
but the medication he takes
makes him wasted
so sick if hes gonna think
the good lord would come take him
im shaking him wake up
you son of a bitch

hes dying to get away
let the pain of yesterday
go slipping through the cracks
hiding himself away
watching all the memories fade
away from red to black

hes dying to get away
let the pain of yesterday
go slipping through the cracks
hiding himself away
watching all the memories fade
away from red to black

slipping through the cracks
slipping through the cracks
slipping through the cracksthese hungry rappers battle for a buck and some change
there really be kids starving

not that
you get signed you might blow up
release party in iraq

you might blow up
i see you trying to think a few lines you might get at me with
slap happy with babies whore born with crack in they cribs
too much to cram under you oversized titled
and the public school system failed you
either you ignore it oryou know me i used to
get caught up in everyday life
tried to make it through my day
so i could sleep at night
tried to figure out my way
through the maze of rights and wrongs
but like you used to say
nothing feels like its really worth it

forget perfect
im trying not to be worthless
since i last saw you
ive been lookin for a purpose
well i met this kid
who thought like i did
he had a weird way of lookin at it
this is what he said

slip out the back before they know you were there
and at the worst youll see nobody cares
cause you dont wanna be around when it all goes down
even heroes know when to be scared
slip out the back before they know you were there
and at the worst youll see nobody cares
cause you dont wanna be around when it all goes down
even heroes know when to be scared

now i dont remember where i met him
or remember his name
but he walked funny like he
was just too big for his frame
just over five foot
but he weighed a buck fifty
and what he said seemed so right
it stuck with me

listen its like poker
you can play your bets
but you got to know when to fold
your cards and take a rest
and know when to hold your cards
hold your breath
and hope that nobody else
is stacking the deck because

i dont need to tell you
that life isnt fair
it doesnt care
it arbitrarily cuts off your air
and like you
i want someone to say its okay
in the truest parts of our hearts
everybodys afraid

were just under appreciated
and overwhelmed
fighting so hard to hide our fear
that were scaring ourselves
you understand what im saying
cause you always did
but its different in the words
of a cowardly kid who said

slip out the back before they know you were there
and at the worst youll see nobody cares
cause you dont wanna be around when it all goes down
even heroes know when to be scared
slip out the back before they know you were there
and at the worst youll see nobody cares
cause you dont wanna be around when it all goes down
even heroes know when to be scared

and im no hero
you remember how it was you know
all i ever did was worry
feeling out of control
to the point where everything
was going end over end
im spinning around
in circles again

this is where you come in

all of this
to explain to you why
i had to separate myself
away from yesterdays life
please remember
this isnt how i hoped it would be
but i had to protect you
from me

thats why i slipped out the back before you knew i was there
i know you felt unprepared
but every single time i was around i just bring you down
and i could tell that it was time to be scared
thats why i slipped out the back before you knew i was there
and i know the way i left wasnt fair
i didnt want to be around just to bring you down
im not a hero but dont think i didnt careuh ms lupe

i wont pull any punches hold anything back / ill

when its all said and done im gonna leave you wondering
how did we do what we did

if anybodys out there listening to this broadcast of minemy father came from japan in 1905
he was 15 when he immigrated from japan
he he he worked until he was able to buy this patch
and build a store

let me tell you the story in the form of a dream
i dont know why i have to tell it but i know what it means
close your eyes just picture the scene
as i paint it for you it was world war ii
when this man named kenji woke up
ken was not a soldier
he was just a man with a family who owned a store in la

that day he crawled out of bed like he always did
bacon and eggs with wife and kids
he lived on the second floor of a little store he ran
he moved to la from japan
they called him immigrant
in japanese hed say he was called issei
that meant first generation in the united states

when everyone was afraid of the germans afraid of the japs
but most of all afraid of a homeland attack
and that morning when ken went out on the doormat
his world went black cause
right there front page news three weeks before 1942
pearl harbours been bombed and the japs are comin

pictures of soldiers dyin and runnin
ken knew what it would lead to
just like he guessed the president said
the evil japanese in our home country will be locked away
they gave ken a couple of days
to get his whole life packed in two bags
just two bags couldnt even pack his clothes

some folks didnt even have a suitcase to pack anything in
so two trash bags was all they gave them
and when the kids asked mom where are we goin
nobody even knew what to say to them
ken didnt wanna lie he said the us is lookin for spies
so we have to live in a place called manzanar
where a lot of japanese people are

stop it dont look at the gunmen
you dont wanna get the soldiers wonderin
if you gonna run or not
cause if you run then you might get shot
other than that try not to think about it
try not to worry bout it bein so crowded
someday well get out someday someday

as soon as war broke out
the fbi came and they just come to the house and
you have to come
all the japanese have to go
they took mr lee
people didnt understand
why did they have to take him
because hes an innocent laborer

so now theyre in a town with soldiers surroundin them
every day every night look down at them
from watch towers up on the wall
ken couldnt really hate them at all
they were just doin their job and
he wasnt gonna make any problems

he had a little garden with vegetables and fruits that
he gave to the troops in a basket his wife made
but in the back of his mind he wanted his families life saved
prisoners of war in their own damn country what for

time passed in the prison town
he wanted if hed live it down if and when they were free
the only way out was joinin the army
and supposedly some men went out for the army signed on
and ended up flyin to japan with a bomb
that 15 kiloton blast put an end to the war pretty fast
two cities were blown to bits the end of the war came quick

ken got out big hopes of a normal life
wwith his kids and his wife but
when they got back to their home
what they saw made them feel so alone
these people had trashed every room
smashed in the windows and bashed in the doors
written on the walls and the floor
japs not welcome anymore

and kenji dropped both of his bags at his sides and just stood outside
he looked at his wife without words to say
she looked back at him wiped the tears away
and said someday well be okay someday

now the names have been changed but the storys true
my family was locked up back in 42
my family was there it was dark and damp
and they called it an internment camp

when we first got back from camp uhh
it was pretty pretty bad

i i remember my husband said
are we gonna stay til last
then my husband died before they close the campmike

abuse your mother
on a road trip to barbados with eight hoes
im a hoodrat with a winnebago
i make dough
on the block where the bullies were raised to partier
you in idaho grazing pastures getting busy
i dont hold acts unless for something get busy
on the ground i like the bear
and i stay my grizzly

ryu in the background
stay the fuck in the bathroom homieeverybody up
let me introduce to you
a man that you heard of 
or you thought you knew
well give me a couple of seconds just to prove to you
you never did
but let me give you a chance to

i used to swear everybody had it in for me
people only wanted to talk to spit on me
so i paint pictures draw a little bit
and every time i was pissed off at some kid
id head home id draw a little sketch
of any kid i hated with a knife in the neck
a pencil in the eye and a hole in the back
i had a backpack of six sketches like that

and over time people started to see the pictures that i made
made a lot of sense to me but
it never even really made much of a difference
they still talk shit
but not at close distance
and that sucked 
cause all i wanted to have was just a little attention whether good or bad but 
over time i got sick of trying
and kept making the pictures and kept drawing lines

i dont know where im going with this
im just reminiscing and telling the story of this
sit back and take in the story of a kid
as i look back at the strange things i did

everybody up
let me tell the truth to you
i never thought id be anyone youd wish you knew
i just thought id end up a stain on the wall
something you wanna fix if you see it at all

anyway back a few years time
i had a class with a smart mouth friend of mine
and we would sit in the back
the two of us combined
would make fun of everybody just to pass the time

now we did it quietly so no one heard
a couple of nerds with pages full of pictures and words
untill this kid heard we were calling him names
and decided to get tough
i remember he came up 
to me that day front of half my friends
and talked shit so loud
people couldnt pretend they didnt hear him
saying he would beat my ass
and i laughed
but he was serious and pushed me back
at this point i was pretty confused
this little bitch was all amped
so what could i do
i shoulda come back at him for all to see
but instead i just told him that it wasnt me

x2
i dont know where im going with this
im just reminiscing and telling the story of this
sit back and take in the story of a kid
as i look back at the strange things i did

its like flatliners
you see that flick
people die and come back seeing crazy shit
people that they did wrong come back and attack them
and everyone they hurt comes back for revenge
well if that was ever gonna to happen to me
id potentially would be attacked constantly
but then again for all the pain in my past
thered be a lot of people that had better watch their ass

x2
i dont know where im going with this
im just reminiscing and telling the story of this
sit back and take in the story of a kid
as i look back at the strange things i didi guess that this is where weve come to
if you dont want to then you dont have to believe me
but i wont be there when you go down
just so you know now youre on your own now believe me

yo i dont wanna be the one to blame
you like fun and games keep playin em im just sayin
think back then we was like one and the same
on the right track but i was on the wrong train

its like that now you gotta face the pain
and the devils got a fresh new place to play
in your brain like a maze you can never escape
the rain every damn days the same shade of grey

hey i used to have a little bit of a plan
used to have a concept of where i stand
but that concept slipped right outta my hand
now i dont really even know who i am

yo what do i have to say maybe
i should do what i have to do to break free and
whatever happens to you well see
but its not gonna happen with me

i guess that this is where weve come to
if you dont want to then you dont have to believe me
but i wont be there when you go down
just so you know now youre on your own now believe me

back then i thought you were just like me
somebody who could see all the pain i see
but you proved to me unintentionally
that you would self-destruct eventually

now im thinkin like the mistake i made doesnt hurt
but its not gonna work cause its really much worse than i thought
i wished you were something you were not
and now this guilt is really all that ive got

you turned your back and walk away ashamed
all you got is a memory and pain
nothing makes sense so you stare at the ground
and hear my voice in your head when no one else is around

so what do i have to say maybe
i should do what i have to do to break free and
whatever happens to you well see
but its not gonna happen with me

i guess that this is where weve come to
if you dont want to then you dont have to believe me
but i wont be there when you go down
just so you know now youre on your own now believe me

yeah
lets go

i guess that this is where weve come to
if you dont want to then you dont have to believe me
but i wont be there when you go down
just so you know now youre on your own now believe me

im doin what i have to do
youre on your own now believe me
whatever happens to you
youre on your own now believe me

what do i have to say
youre on your own now believe me
its not gonna happen with me
youre on your own now believe meyo
give me a second ill write about my pain for pages
i got a head full of frustrated phrases
so just bear with me as i get this out
you know the type of person that im talking about
these people who want to act like theyve got your back
they never had your back they just stab you in it
i never pretended i had it all together inside
i got insecurities and things that im trying to hide
and i could never seem to get anything right
and i could never seem to stop busting my fight
and i could never seem to get it right with you
and i could never redeem myself when im through
but sometimes you know what i just dont care
im gonna speak my mind and let everybody stare
this is the last time im telling you real loud
you wanna tell me im wrong  lets do it right now

is an excuse to let loose the tension i got
start it all up im ready to go
all i need is a signal just to let me know
come on start it all up cuz all i want
is an excuse to let loose the tension i gotthis is not a story that youve heard or you know
everyone in black from the head to the toe
and im sitting in the back in the very last row
hearing everyone ask why i had to go

ladies and gentlemen were gathered here today
to talk about the end in a friend gone away
talking about pretending they dont know what to say
and theyre tripping over words but theyre talking anyway
mingling and singing all these really sad songs
talking of what i did right and forgetting all my wrongs
saying how theyll miss me so much now that im gone
man this is depressing
lets move on

lets move on
come back to life like the light of the dawn
its like a tightrope just move right along
dont look down and dont step wrong
we dont have time so just move on

friends from my past wiping tears on their sleeve
in between people that were never close to me
and as i turn my back on everyone to leave
i know that ill be back to see them all eventually
ive gotta go away just to try something new
cause what im used to isnt all that i can do
just a change of scenery just another view
take it back to the beginning
take it back to the roots

lets move on
come back to life like the light of the dawn
its like a tightrope just move right along
dont look down and dont step wrong
we dont have time so just move on
come back to life like the light of the dawn
its like a tightrope just move right along
dont look down and dont step wrong
we dont have time so just move on

just move on
just move
