por tu culo o por tu chocha
y ya tu sabes que no me importa
y ella me dice senencito
yo pienso que tu eres bien rico

cuando me toca por mi frente
ya tu me tienes bien caliente
y cuando me tocas por detras
ya tu sabes sin parar

sali del cuarto y me esperaba
con los ojos negros y bonita cara

*short pause then outro comes on over stoned instrumental*

the physical effects of marijuana
the first sensations may be felt instantly after having smoked grass
or an hour after having eaten
usually they creep slowly into this stoned condition
inch by inch sliding upward but to beatnik
the effects may come upon you suddenly and startle you full force
the physical effects of marijuana
there are four basic types of marijuana
pyschologically sometimes the early psychological stages
coincide with the early physical stages experienced while stoned
the famous mind expansion comes after the famous physical sensation
grass heightens and distorts
for example profound revelations
you may think you have profound revelations only to discover
*music and fade obscure final words*i want to get high so high

so punk me and ill give you the world exact change
or quote me and youre never the same i claim no one
i show none the weakness individuals go forth ya seek this
wherever i roam is home to me
you shogun look at my enemies try to do me
the influential status you know the baddest
lookie here show you what that is bringin the madness
sadness to those appealin to any conflict
lookin out my window pane i see you fallin
what are you a man or a mouse the house light
shinin within thats when you begin to live again

chorus

sen dog
from my window i can see
humanity goin insane g
everybody want respect but you gotta collect
only hardcore vatos on the set
dont get me wrong but some rhymes get twisted
there it goes the pride you missed it
i aint upset with the motherfucker dissin
find me in watts when you wanna come hit me
some shit aint what it seems in the land of dreams
some sell their soul to get the cream
from the teens i dont sling or slang no crack
im known for bringin in funky ass raps
see those magazine crews and im a goner
dull interviews with these damn primadonnas
unlike some of these fools on the turf
look like the real thing but they soft like nerfs
so unrehearsed that it shows in the product
need to get the fuck out before you get caught up

with troops like babe ruth up on the mezzanine
brandishing sub-machine guns aye-yo
its all about the money son
now thats the only reason
we came south of the border to complete this work order
we gotta get it no looking back going all out for it
ready to attack die in a minute flat for it
as god is my witness we got ditches

tequila sunrise bloodshot eyes

verse two b-real

i never knew money like this in the palm of my hand

every where you looka he got everybody shook up
running for cover the big bad woof motherfucker
he was like a father figure show me the bigger picture
fuck slangin on the corner dont let the pigs get you
not like these fools who dont comprehend
you end up doing a twenty-five bid in the pen
you got that getting your cup i took a swig
the bitter taste of the mezcal free worm shit
droppin a lesson he slapped my face he said listen
pay attention brotha youre my ace but dont ever question
just do what i say and youll be rich
and keep this in your mind rats lay in a ditch with no spine
dont ever forget that golden rule in the game
cheers they all know your name its like fame
why women and money dont mix like drinking an driving
watch those conniving women and keep your eye out
always be aware of whats around you
they wanna down you and fuckin clown you
keep your shit in order the money wont stop
pretty soon youll be on top

chorus

verse three b-real

coughin up a lung high strung back in 81 
goin to school hittin the buddah behind the bleachers 
comin to class high sellin the lye to the teachers 
nickel bag nickel bag dime to a nickel 
sellin joints to the honeys suck it like an icicle 
others wanted the 40 but i wanted the weed 
while everybody was runnin out i was plantin my seeds 
homegrown backyard boogie im still stoned 
got my weed plants taller than your telephones corner 
i can remember when i could only get sess in those days 
now im rockin that chocolate thai skunk and the haze 
roll a fat one pass it to the left dont front 
but i hate it when they dont take the seeds out the blunt

no roaches up in the ashtray smoke up all the bomb

but i hate it when the pigs throw a raid on the spot 
it was once said i smoke so much weed by a brother 
that i look like the nigga on the zig-zag cover

when my nigga sen dog was around sippin on the hen 
let the fly rhymes smother you with the scent of the skunk 
we got the high times cover shows you how to roll a blunt

let the rain pour down from god above 
with the blood of my blade no love begin the flood 
open the gates let the battle begin wherein 
with wind at our backs ready for any attacks 
sound the horns prepare for war begin the storm 
the flaming arrows hitting your body keeping you warm 
with the uniform of my sworn enemies 
you raped and pillaged my city and spread disease 
feel the sword of the warriors wrath the path you take 
can lead to the math that the masters break 
the clash of the titans are you frightened of loss 
fighting with the cause to free you and yours and gods law 
look in the stars aligned with sign and mars 
destruction whats your function you roll with god

breaking ya faster transmitting the broadcaster 
the blade swings slashing your throat

dropping the bomb by remote 
load up the cavalrys no salaries the keys 
the lifes memories strife bringing the thieves 
cut the heads off hide in the loft dont even cough 
or breath pay the cost moving your lifes lost 
let the spirit reunite with your weapon you wanna fight 
hear the sound of the warriors stepping into the night 
the eye in the sky looking to punish ya never hide 
no cover to shelter your life the souls begin to rise 
and to clash 

attention 2x 

b-real 
gods enemies fall in upon the knees crawling 
beheading the dead souls who runaway from their calling 
behold the white horse remorse never the case 
every corner of the world the battle is taking place 
let the war drum set the pace you face fire 
resume from the temple of boom and seek higher thought 
maybe you live or maybe not the blades hot 
many renegades ready for battle die on the spot 
with one shot one whole city becomes rocked 
the clash rages on people remain calm 
good bad all in the balance you going mad 
you can never tell heaven or hell the blood shed 
and its all around you cant run sit in the cell 
when the wars over the light will shine covering the spell 
celebrate now put the blades to rest 
no wickedness only the blessed will hold down 

attention 
you creating hysteria 
attention 2x

and rearrange its strange you never go that way
dont look back forget that you need that
just sit back look at the show you see that
display the raw power black out even the score
open the door and break out
leave it alone the unknown fury the blind rage
step aside get fried and make the front page
center stage you ask the task to leave quick
or suffer the pain leavin no hope to be fixed
your heart beat pumpin your blood high pressure
look at you stuck in the mud bring in the stretcher
strapped down ready to roll to god knows
tears coming down of buckets of rain slow

si tu quieres que me toque pues caele
soy el grifo mas escandaloso
de los angeles cypress peligroso
enciende el leño o la pipa
pasalo por mi clica la que rifa

mota rica chipa chipa
quemando yesca estoy arriba
es algo que yo hago diario
al despertar y tambien todo el dia en mi barrio
cuando me encuentres en cualquier lugar
saca papeles porque quiero fumar mota

empiece me fumo yerba verde
aveces tumbo gente
vi que un maniaco queria tu carro
crees que la chota te va hacer un paro
no creo que te vas a parar
y comenzar a cuetear disparar
mueve puro fierro
y te deja todo chueco
como me vas a entender si balazos no te ha llovido
entiendes lo que digo
cuando ta de maton cierro tu canton
por aqui se pone cabron
por el dinero barrio peleonero
muchas veces robos dejan entierros

chorus

all i wanted was a pepsi[b-real]
hola me dicen dedoverde hola

aunque ahi estan los puercos no parare
con conecta influencia yo seguire
bendito sea dios por el zacate
no dejes que la torta al rescate
cargame estoy listo para volar
no me encuentran ni con radar
no dejes que caiga el gobierno
no hay negocio sin permiso
todo en la vida tiene riesgo

por eso soy el doctor mas listo
el místico mejor dicho cientifico
creciendo lo mio con rayos del sol
prueben y veran que lo mio es lo mejor
si ven la poli hasta luego vamos

y se cuando me ve no me aguanta
por que los puercos no les gusta cuando dice
eres un rapero del grupo que canta
este trabaja con la mafia
haciendo dinero de las drogas
pero a este puerquito lo cogieron
so cuando llegue al bote le van a partir su boca
por que cunado llegue al bote
no le van dar pa que se pueda protectar
de un negro loco que el mismo
un dia trato de arrestar

aterrizando en un lago escondido y alejado
directos al estadio huyendo
de lugar a lugar destruyendo

chorus

[b-real]
donde se que este es el que sigue se enciende
pachele parate y dile de cual eres

torcido en el bote donde no salgo 
quedo bien locote 
un toque fumo pa calmarme 
me dejaron mi tiempo no pudieron darme 
fue un error porque soltaron a un criminal ese 
yo busco alguien parecido 
algo como yo que viva como vivo 
caminando solo a mi no me conoce nadie 
pienso que deveras no valgo madre 
un delinquente solo ves 
y recuerdo que aqui han muerto mis carnales 
quiero que paren esto 
pero no voy a morir por mi propia mano 

chorus

where you never know if youll be making it home today
so many different attitudes that i come across
im harden and scarred and i aint feeling nobodys loss
hustlers hookers killers and thieves out on the street
got my mind warped just found another corpse on the beat bound
gagged rapes im frustrated i hate it found a woman in the
dumpster body was mutilated
bad dreams all up in my head no lie
sometimes i got to take a sniff so i could get by
why dont i get help to settle my nerves i got the erg
to merge this bullet with my brain release my pain
what a fuckin shame i dont wanna live
ill paint the wall with the bloodstains eye of the pig

i remember the days when i was a young kid growin up
lookin in the mirror dreamin about blowin up
the rock crowd make money true with the honeys 
sign autographs or whatever the people want from me
shits funny how impossible dreams manifest
and the games that be comin with it nevertheless
you gotta go for the gusto but you dont know
about the blood sweat and tears and losin some of your peers
and losin some of yourself to the years past gone by
hopefully it dont manifest for the wrong guy
egomaniac in the brainiac dont know how to act
shits deep 48 tracks studio gangsta max
signed the deal thinks hes gonna make a mil
but never will til he crosses over
still fillin your head with fantasies come with me
show the sacrifice it takes to make the gs

so you wanna be a rock superstar in the biz
and take shit from people who dont know what it is
i wish it was all fun and games but the price of fame is high
and some cant pay to play
feel trapped in what you rappin about
tell me what happened when you lost clout
what route you took started collapsin
no fans no fame no respect no change
no women and everybody shits on your name

so you wanna be a rock superstar and live large
your big house five cars youre in charge
comin up in the world dont trust nobody
gotta look over your shoulder constantly
to be a rock superstar and live large
your big house five cars youre in charge

long as you sell everything will be okay
then you get dissed by the media n fans

my own people disown me and the best way back
is to keep your head straight never inflate the cranium
youre too worried about them honeys at the palladium
who just wanna cling on swing on and so forth

to the next rock superstar with no shame
give him a year and theyll be right out the game
the same as the last one who came before him
gained fame started gettin ignored

sleazy people wanna be so cheesy
theyre fuckin evil

your big house five cars youre in charge

most people dont see how much work is really involved 
in this rap shit 
i didnt know it 
i didnt see it 
i never saw it until i was actually in it 
you really gotta be in it 
to understand what its like 
but you always gotta 
people always gotta see your smile 
you always gotta put on that fake 
you know what im sayin 
no matter what u just been through 
shit has gotta be right 

b-real 
so you wanna be a rap superstar 
and live large into a big house 
5 cars youre in charge 
comin up in the world 
dont trust nobody 
gotta look over your shoulder constantly 

b-real 
i remember the days when i was a young kid growin up 
lookin in the mirror dreamin about blowin up 
to rock crowds make money 
chill with the homies 
signing autographs and whatever the people wanted from me 
shits funny 
how impossible dreams manifest in the games that be comin with it 
nevertheless you gotta go for the gusto 
but you dont know about the blood sweat and tears 
and losin some of your peers 
and losin some of yourself 
music has past gone by 
hopefully you wont manifest for the wrong guy 
egomaniac in the brainiac 
dont know how to act 
shits deep 
48 tracks 
studio gangsta mack 
sign a deal emcees wanna make a mill 
but never will 
till he crosses over still 
fillin your head 
with fantasies come with me 
ill show you the sacrifice it takes to make the gs 
you wanna be a rap superstar in the biz 
and take shit from people who dont know what it is 
i wish it was all fun and games 
but the price of fame is high 
and some cant pay the way 
trapped in what you rappin about 
tell me what happened when you lost clout 
the rout you took started collapsing 
no fans 
no fame 
no respect 
no change 
no women 
and everybody shits on your name 

chorus 
so you wanna be a rap superstar 
and live large 
into big house 
5 cars 
the rent charged 
comin up in the world dont trust nobody 
gotta look over your shoulder constantly 
and be a rap superstar 
and live large 
into a big house 
5 cars 
youre in charge 
comin up in the world dont trust nobody 
gotta look over your shoulder constantly 

noreaga speaking 
when you sign to a record label 
you dont know you sign your life over 
and these whiteboys dont care about you 
cuz the minute you fall off 
theyll find another noreaga 
and theyll find another capone-n-noreaga 
and theyll find another b-real 
so you need to just keep 
stack your chips up 
do what you gotta do while your hot 
and madafuckin get out the game 
this isnt like the drug game this is even worse 
because in the drug game if someone jerks you 
you can shoot em and kill em 
but in this game if someone jerks you 
you gotta be noble 

eminem speaking 
no matter what you just been through 
shit has gotta be right 
you gotta approach people 
you gotta be on the up and up 
and everything gotta be all good 
when you see someone slap hands with em 
you know what im sayin give em a pound 
or whatever it is 
but you always gotta act like it aint shit 

chorus 

b-real

so the record gets pushed by sony 
im in the middle like monie 
and the press say that 
my own people disowned me 
and the best way back 
is to keep your head straight 
never inflate the cranium 
your crew worried about them homies at the paladium 
who just wanna cling on swing on 
and so on and go on and fall off 
the hoes fall off 
to the next rap superstar 
wit no shame give him a year 
and theyll be right out the game 
the same as the last one

your big house five cars youre in charge
comin up in the world dont trust nobody
gotta look over your shoulder constantly

i remember the days when i was a young kid growin up
lookin in the mirror dreamin about blowin up
the rock crowd make money true with the honeys 
sign autographs or whatever the people want from me
shits funny how impossible dreams manifest
and the games that be comin with it nevertheless
you gotta go for the gusto but you dont know
about the blood sweat and tears and losin some of your peers
and losin some of yourself to the years past gone by
hopefully it dont manifest for the wrong guy
egomaniac in the brainiac dont know how to act
shits deep 48 tracks studio gangsta max
signed the deal thinks hes gonna make a mil
but never will til he crosses over
still fillin your head with fantasies come with me
show the sacrifice it takes to make the gs

so you wanna be a rock superstar in the biz
and take shit from people who dont know what it is
i wish it was all fun and games but the price of fame is high
and some cant pay to play
feel trapped in what you rappin about
tell me what happened when you lost clout
what route you took started collapsin
no fans no fame no respect no change
no women and everybody shits on your name

so you wanna be a rock superstar and live large
your big house five cars youre in charge
comin up in the world dont trust nobody
gotta look over your shoulder constantly
to be a rock superstar and live large
your big house five cars youre in charge
comin up in the world dont trust nobody
gotta look over your shoulder constantly

you ever have big dreams of makin big cream
big shot heavy hitter on the mainstream
you wanna look trendy in the bentley
be a star bam never act friendly
you wanna have big fame let me explain
what happens to these stars and their big brains
first they get played like all damn day
long as you sell everything will be okay
then you get dissed by the media n fans
things never stay the same way they began
i heard that some nigga gave full to the fullest
thats why fools end up dining on the bullet
think everythings fine in the big time
see me in my lace with the chrome ring shine
so you wanna go far and live large
it aint all that goes with bein a rock star

so you wanna be a rock superstar and live large
your big house five cars youre in charge
comin up in the world dont trust nobody
gotta look over your shoulder constantly
to be a rock superstar and live large
your big house five cars youre in charge
comin up in the world dont trust nobody
gotta look over your shoulder constantly

my own son dont know me
im chillin in the hotel room lonely
but i thank god im with my homies
but sometimes i wish i was back home but only
no radio or videos gonna show me
no love theyre phony
gotta hit the road solely so the record gets pushed by sony
im in the middle like mony and the press say that
my own people disown me and the best way back
is to keep your head straight never inflate the cranium
youre too worried about them honeys at the palladium
who just wanna cling on swing on and so forth
go on fall off the whole foot long
to the next rock superstar with no shame
give him a year and theyll be right out the game
the same as the last one who came before him
gained fame started gettin ignored
i warned him assured him
this aint easy take it from wheezy
sleazy people wanna be so cheesy
theyre fuckin evil

so you wanna be a rock superstar and live large
your big house five cars youre in charge
comin up in the world dont trust nobody
gotta look over your shoulder constantly

places where i spend time places where my mind roam

why you wanna fuck wit me

feet planted on the ground

it all goes around me and others who would down me
who i dont give a fuck about trouble always found me

i try to put it to you bluntly so you bitches can learn 
that no-body get tired when its time to burn

troubles knockin on the door anxious jus to come inside
times i gotta block it out no-one likes to talk it out
trouble keeps comin and i cant seem to lock it out
got my hands on the phone i dont wanna have to talk
if youre feelin funky son then i guess you gotta jump
i can see it in your eyes you dont seem to recognise
i wouldnt fall into your trap for many lives to compromise
im not fallin for your shit you aint gonna take me there

that was about the time we was openin up for loyalty 
didnt know shit we were jus tryin to rock the party 

92 *echoes* a year later bout a million records sold 
from doin shows like lollapalooza on the road 
buildin up momentum whilst spittin deadly venom 
takin pictures for high times three months  
chillin with the beastie boys smokin lots of weed 
but it was time to hit the studio for another lp 

93 *echoes* black sunday hits with critical acclaim 
had a monster hit from insane in the brain 
topped the charts held the spot for six weeks to boot 
it was a trip to note that we was the first ones to do it 
in rap music but it was a feat none the less 
so we started gettin paid and i stopped smokin stress 

chorus 

b-real 
94 *echoes* still in the door and we conquered many tours 
with rage against the machine house of pain and many more 
was even invited to woodstock some niggas from the block 
called up eric bobo and half a million rocked 
how could all this happen at 24 years of age 
half a million bouncin to your shit from off the stage 

95 *echoes* i was alive and survived so far *rap superstar 
xylophone* 
still tryin to cope with bein a rap star 
cos thats the type of shit that can really affect your mental 
this was evident in the way i broke the tempo 
with confusinim havin illusions pain and  illusions 
but i still kept my set up with the critics bein abusive yeah 
even the record company they became illusive 
when it comes to showin support for the cypress institution 

96 *echoes* wit no support we were still makin moves 
cypress hill in the summer we were on the smokin grooves 
but like every legend every click someone had to split 
so the dog left the house shit was gettin kinda thick 
i was with the electric lady we was talkin about babies 
but the groupies on the road dont help me from misbehavin 

chorus just 1 repeat 

b-real 
97 *echoes* was the trip it was the year we killed the feud 
between us and cube over shit nobody knew 
the dog came back home *barking* but after smokin grooves 2 
chillin with george clinton and erykah badu 
this was a crazy time we were flowin off the boo 
niggas on stage trippin on the shrooms 

98 *echoes* was kinda great cos it felt just like before 
we hit the studio recorded cypress hill iv 
but someone dropped the ball as i still recall 
cos it felt cypress hill got no support at all 
we did the last smokin grooves but did it all with sen 
and the old chemistry just reared its head again 

99 *echoes* i got to recline because there was no doubt 
that the first year was a success of the smoke out 
99 was even better than the year of 98 
and skull and bones was comin out kickin from the gate 

two-thousand *echoes* 15 million records sold 
they broke the mould but theres others along the road 
but we still keep rollin on from heaven to atlantis 
droppin shit in english and makin albums in spanish 

two-thousand and one *echoes* goddamn who knows whats in store 
just as long as motherfuckers know whos knockin on the door 
we remain unjaded and still we go unfaded 
see how long we made it and never ben outdated

i remember times i hustle times i struggle
times i had to get over the everyday shuffle
people tryin to muffle my thoughts and all my dreams too
people who i thought were down and see true
but i blame me too cos its a chronicle 
my life i realise im responsible for obstacles 
in front of me my own self to blame
but i worked hard to receive the wealth and fame 
its a worthless game but if youre willing to play
theres sharks in the water who are willing to pay 
the price of your soul but if you give it away
you silly motherfuckers are all commited to stay 
its a cold world but you still want a part of it
so then youd better fuck around and learn the art of it
dont walk through life with your blinders on
cos youll keep goin crazy til your mind is gone

it aint easy yo it aint easyas i sit in my silver stack thinking about way back
even before i started blazing the chronic sack
i was a go wild unfocused troublesome kid
looking up to all the gangsters and the shit they did
i was at unimpressionable age through a faze
an unmentionable stage deranged full of rage
walking through life in a haze with dark clouds
hanging over my head being wicked and loud
and sometimes those demons haunt me and taunt me
follow me pursue me confuse me they want me
they come at me from all angles and dangles
memories in front of me but i wont run away
i put the gun away but sometimes my hand ditches
but i dont want to get locked away cause i whack bitches
i left those ways back in the old days
so go away i dont got no time to throw away

memories they haunt me they haunt me they follow me
to the day i die we fight and we struggle out here so we can stay alive
memories they haunt me they haunt me they follow me
to the day i die got to do what i got to do out her so i can survive

i got my education on the streets
and i learned how to spit rhymes out with or without beats
to say whatever i went through or going through
tripping off people who acting like they been knowin you
learn how some of these record companies be holdin you
attaching an image in the end controllin you 
but we set out to set ourselves apart
and let these people know just what they had from the start
its like ghostface said we studied our art form
we turned the mike on and spit a fucking dark storm
people slept on me and doubted my skill level
but im tenacious and i got a strong will level
you been introduced to some of the real rebels
injected with venom from god to kill devils

i remember my days as youth
teenage gangsters with somethin to prove
see man amuse and we creep and we strew
catch your ass slipping and dump on their crew
just -- having fun but you crazy kids
never thought about no prison beds
got gang-sters twenty-five and alive
never see the kids all fucking wild
but thats the game and shit dont change
get respect for smoking brains
you get a name and you build your rep
you courting fools coming in your set
before you know were having fun
slamming doping and packing gun
leaving mad traces and blasting their faces
got a hundred years for all my fucking cases

slangin dope poppin shroomz and droppin lots of sin 
psychodelic visions would ensue 
my view feelin the alter-states as they altered my fate 
but i   all that distorted shit brought it up 
i came short and couldnt afford to store it up 
so i began to record it on audio 
the autobiography of luis mario 
something thats unbelievable inconceivable 
that half the shit i set out to do was achievable 
but alas look at all the shit come to pass 
while we remained strong others broke like glass 
cos you lack style and you need all the help brother 
cos youre fragile and it should say it on your cover 
this side up for the celebrity 
who lacks intelligence integrity intensity 
oh its true i got you in that angle like kurt 
but dont go gettin your fuckin feelings hurt 
i spit many bars of heat that burn like a furnace 
i pour rhymes out like coffee spillin out your dermis

spreading gossip like disease creating lots of tension 
people turn around when you become a star it seems 
but others hate you all cos youve fulfilled all your dreams 
they smile in your face and act like nothings wrong 
when you turn your back they hate and play one of your 
songs 
why dont you take your mask off look me in the eye 
you afraid i might blast-off and call you on your life 
take a deep one and peep son 
retribution comes around more than once like a re-run 
youre a cheap one to kill so steep son 
youre just another one who gets thrown in the quay son

my first mission
running through the hood with small jacks
my memories popping in my head recall that
late night creeping through the alley with six dudes
scraped up everybody focused no mixed views
the sawed off pump in my hand with two shells
the other four homies on the scene with cocktails
one nigga looking for po po
someone looking through windows
the doorbells go followed by the pump and gas bomb
adrenaline pumped up
still i remain calm
house lit up
you can see it for eight blocks
running through the hood
running from them fake cops
they gave chase but they couldnt cover the streets up
we broke out ran into the spot to meet up
strapped down cover up the tracks
and back home
lay low earn me a strap

chorus 4x

verse two

ill break it off right quick
niggaz be duckin when they see my bucket

chorus 4x
shoot em up bang bang
another body drop

slugs fly thugf die moment you fell down
somebody screaming yo get the hell down
im certified nigga where you sitting is spell bound
your dogs walking just hearing the hell hounds
burn you with the heaters spitting out 12 rounds
its life in the hood
no escaping the gun play

got you locked in not one slug was stray
i found ways out but it seems to be one way

i couldnt stop staring i started to fantasize with her 
voices in my head said shes tantalizing ya even if i 
moved to the other side of the party i had pictures in my 
head of her moving that body i was beside myself with conquer
pain so i slowly walked over and i asked her name

[b-real]
you was a good kid your parents musta loved you
they got you out of trouble no matter how big the bubble
they gave you everything nah you never needed nothin
we used to get high member we was weeded cousin
we used to go to clubs blaze it up and act crazy
what made you turn around was it drugs or your lady
we had good times committin hood crimes
we drew lines but you never understood mine
you dont go fuckin homies just like my momma told me
i held my hood up boldly you were a fuckin phony
i guess it manifested when i got the call early
they said you bunkered down in the hood with ol girly
she had your back covered but that didnt matter did it
i know youre livin but you put your fuckin self in it
dont try to make a move nigga dont go fuckin dere
i know youre hurtin cause youre tied up to the fuckin chair
you never loved your family you robbed that mall gladly
they tried to love you sadly you let em down badly
just call me deaths angel but we were never strangers
you bout to get mangled thats truer than kurt angle
now its time to pay any last words to say
i know your mind strays son i think you need to pray
dont even need to tell you you were a smart nigga
save your teardrops yo dont even start nigga
you shoulda thought of that long ago before you fucked me
you dodged me long enough homey now you been lucky
but now its pay the piper no fuckin traps or snipers
just the gas and lighter caught up in the web of spiders
but now you get devoured burnin in the flames you coward
this is the very hour i send your family flowers
im sure they all will miss you but they will be good without you
theyll reminisce and light a candle as they talk about you

[cypress hill]

this pig he is the chief

hes got a son thats a pig too
hes collectin pay-offs from a dark alley
this pigs known as a narco

{*music fades*}church bells gong

verse one b-real
as a kid i was known son of a thug
snub-nosed 38 in the glove who can relate with us
never had an easy life shits way out
clips spray out fools pay out or play out
any scenario been there done that
gone where some of yall niggaz couldnt come back
been through the hottest parts of hell
came back with a hard shell and hard as nails
i went through it all do it all screw it all
small you recall the hard times as a juve-nile
often misunderstood
some joined the military others just joined the hood
street corner combat part of the dark streets
your heart beats pump when my slugs release
and there aint no tellin dont be the one yellin
these birds are deadly they can shatter your melon

chorus 2x b-real
when the street wars jump off theres only one thing to do
grab your gat and squeeze one off
this aint the life of the soft ones who run off
you got one shot to get you a knot

verse two b-real
at the crossroads sick of holdin the badlands
where street wars kick off quicker than van dam
mistakes of mad man i remember the old ways
the old days where fools clapped yo {}
no quarter you feel me
life expectancys just a little bit shorter
gs gave the order you carried em out
quick fast you the last nigga im worried about
get that street lead that was one step over the edge
much closer to death every step i kept on
learnin about the dark paths made a hard left
prayed to god death is swift and painless
this life aint for everyone stay out my shoes
you cant trade your fate i hate to break the news
the young wont respect the fences these days
you a marked man if you get caught up in these ways

chorus
when the street wars jump off theres only one thing to do
grab your gat and squeeze one off
this aint the life of the soft ones who run off
you got one shot to get you a knot

pause for spooky instrumental

chorus
when the street wars jump off theres only one thing to do
grab your gat and squeeze one off
this aint the life of the soft ones who run off
you got one shot to get you a knotb-real
how many times have we been thru this
i can tell you that its getting harder everytime i try to resist
we go way back and you held me down
helped my feet moving on the ground
no matter what situation ocasion
you were amazing you knew just what it took to keep dough up blazing 
i kept you by me but when we seperated i was thinkin foolishly
remember when your ex-boy tried to bug on me
i told to bring it on and  on me
he didnt like that but didnt want the fight
fuck im he didnt know how to treat you right
we go hand in hand they dont understand a man
but you do and i really respect that damn
we been down so long but its all good
thats why i dedicate this song

chorus repeat 2x
till death do us part
i do

verse two b-real
who would have thought it would last so long
so many new ones think that they cant go wrong
i know i make so many mistakes
i know you felt neglected you caught me outta line
if you thought i didnt respect it - i heard ya
but i never showed an emotion
if i havent ever said it you got on my devotion
when i fell hard you picked me up
maybe think about my life where im going a little tricky - huh
i know there were time where you thought i would change
but im the same motherfucking brother even in spite of the fame
there might be some times we dont agree on some
but dont never feel your thoughts dont mean nothing
some have tried to steal  im not one of those people
always tell it like it is cuz the  but dont get mad
when truth is leaving im only telling you cuz i got your back

chorus

verse threee b-real
you got my mind right and i dont know how you did it
when i trip not too many who can put with it
but you still there still care so well - oh yeah
got so much love 
i appreaciate what youre doing for me
i had to open up my eyes so i can see the minutes we lost
whenever i was out on tour  we could make it up like never before
you want all the little things that make it work it
why not we can get it we both deserve it
its hard but  good its ever so easy
we have a bond that wont break no mistake believe me
till death do us part like i said from the start
youre the light that guides me thru when im in the dark
they said wed neverlast but were still strong
thats why i dedicate this song - cmon

chorus - 4x

are you ready to die ready to die tell me
i see your look in your eye and its deadly
better pray to the sky and get ready
when you decide come on tell me

[verse 1]
you got a choice in life with a fork in the road
got your back turned with your eyes closed with a blindfold
when you open them up theres a signpost
enter at your own risk better find out where your home is
some chose the streets livin a life outlawed
doubt youll see me spittinmy game southpole
careful with the choices you make
you gotta live with them cant you hear the voices you hate
how do you deal with them
some took another path felt they own wrath add drugs to the math
cut the life spans in half from deaths to cold sweats
to soul lets go into the abbys
we are gonna miss you yo

[chorus]

[verse 2]
i put my fist up i aint gonna hit you nigga
i got no regrets i aint gonna diss you nigga
i just pray for you even though youre hard headed
you made your own bed and i hope you dont get wetted
i took the wrongsteps too but i learned from them
i drew heat from my niggaz like the burning sun
but like all lessons i need a self check i still got my strap
but now i use my brain as a weapon
could have stood left chose death no bread underfed
all these niggaz spraying lead pushing on me laying dead
this aint gonna happen yet bitches im a fucking vet
if youre coming for my head you can get a slug instead
every nigga something something dues are they even fucking paid up
what do you say to all the haters writing in the fukin papers
homie wake up or we take up all the ground that you cant make up

[chorus]i used to carry a glock on the waist line man i dont waste time

[x2]living in the big city
the american dream
is far roaming in the streets of greed
everywhere i turn im on a mission for more
but i aint selling my soul
with the dope theres no girl
im on a one way box to the top
hitting the strip but got a sound that would rally the block
im in the fast lane and i wont stop
you aint nothing but talk
you couldnt hang on the rope by ball
this life that i live
it aint for the weak
got my roddy gangster that came off the street
im trying to keep the peace
but i gotta keep my pace
got these drunk police
want me all rappy
and im searching for the higher ground
i want my head in the sky
so high that i cant come down
leave your lies in every town across the nation
cause you can never stop to play
gotta rise up to the top to the top
cant stop how high can you get
gotta rise up to the top to the top
cant stop how high can you get
cause what goes up must come down
so we gotta rise up to the higher ground
rise up rise up
rise up rise up
rise up rise up
how high can you get
cruising in the drop chevy
got my foot on the floor
im hitting switches and my brim is heavy
you wanna look inside
and see whos crossing the brine
curiosity is killing you
with stick in the prime
i get high from the brim in the set
never gripping the square
but all you haters couldnt hold my
dont need a clip for my  straight
you should leave it alone
and check your toe cause my line will spit
this right heres as high as it gets
somebody likes itthe hell

cause you stepped on the sex
but guess who will show you you gotta pass the check
got my clock on deck and my custom vest streets
you came for me im the best
and you can keep the dress
cause im smoke at the less
turn a step back im tired of getting pushed
gotta rise up to the top to the top
cant stop how high can you get
gotta rise up to the top to the top
cant stop how high can you get
cause what goes up must come down
so we gotta rise up to the higher ground
rise up rise up
rise up rise up
rise up rise up
how high can you get
i go psycho
crazy michael myers
except the stages on fire going higher
cause when i lean on a flyer
theres so much more to make the whole city rise
this defines a man to get the whole world lifted
wall man trying to make a land with a mission
theres no way you can stand in this position
you cant take the heat get the fuck about the tension
go with the will to hustle you see if we hit the floor youll never stop it you aint got the muscle
were going to world top homeboy this is the show
we gotta blow up the stage be out the door
sometimes we all nedd an escape
so when we form our track
well get your mind while we get the stat
i made a pack with a crew on the hill
we continue to build with all the people who believe their bill
gotta rise up to the top to the top
cant stop how high can you get
gotta rise up to the top to the top
cant stop how high can you get
cause what goes up must come down
so we gotta rise up to the higher ground
rise up rise up
rise up rise up
rise up rise up
how high can you get[b-real sen dog]

[b-real] 
i was an outcast outsider  trouble maker 
a lost soul outta control in danger 
didnt have a care in the world  my feeling were numb 
never showing emotion i is easy for some
 i dont know how it happened  how i got to this point 
but i needed a way out  i was stuck in a void 
i needed another path or id self destruct 
i was down on my luck  my head was so fucked
a menace rollin the streets is what i was
 holdin my heat and rollin with the serious thugs 
you couldnt tell me a thing i was like my brother
words went in one ear and out the other 
slangin and bangin with a chip on my shoulder 
an insane hit the brain  certified street soldier 
so close to the grave you at an early age
cant tell you the price ive paid  

[mike shinoda - chorus] 
oh the sky overhead is like a canvas of grey 
i dunno how much time  ill be given to stay
from the first break of light  to the end of the day 
im just livin my life  till they come carry me away

  [sen dog]
 ive been there in la nights  in the block where i came up 
my pops used to hate  when we hanged with them bangers
 guess he knew one day that well become us 
thats just how it is when you live where we come from
 fight dont run  is the motto we live by 
get em on the ground  and stomp a mind about ten times
 sure we was just kids back then 
i had no remorse for what we did back then 
six of us one call wed all pack in 
hit the strip and go and get the shit crackin
 gun wars and drug deals i seen em happen
 when i started losin home boys i wasnt laughin 
i looked all around and seen none of em there 
thats when i figured out  that nobody cared 
if we lived or die  well just get high and ride 
and i wasnt gonna let this happen one more time

  [chorus]

  [b-real]
 my mother was there for me  every step of the way
 she didnt judge me  she told me id win some day 
when i was at my lowest  when i had no focus 
she pulled me out the gutter  said i wasnt hopeless
 every night she prayed for me  i was out on the street 
chillin on the corner with the hand on my heat 
eyes open wide for the pigs and foes 
its an every day hazard when you hustle for dough
 so many nights i didnt come home  she thought the worst
 maybe somebody shot me down  without any remorse 
maybe i hurt somebody and i was stuck in a cell 
well i regret all those time that i put her through hell 
when i reflect back on those days my heart aches 
and everybody i lost or let down i wish i could take it all back 
and make it better but i cant so i try to make amends
 and be there through thick and thin  

[chorus]  
 come carry me away 
come carry me away 
come carry me away
 come carry me away [feat daron malakian]

betta learn to behave
these days we pass weed like a relay
sorta like a hand off
then you really handle it
you puff up a hit
then youre lit like a candle
we lead by example
you know that we are showin proof
gonna beat them whose are over you
beat down overdue
had to learn the hard way
homie started flippin and 
we left them in the hallway
gonna puff all day
shut em down late night
motherfuckers wanna play

im a trouble seeker[feat everlast]

im at a strange point of my life my spirit ignites
im destined for heights im so solid with the quest of the life
im under pressure but the time is right
for me to look inside of myself the time passes by every night
im searching for answers meanwhile my faith does surprise
and my neighbours are looking at me with hate in their eyes
quad and tea the streets filled with death and lies
was set up to die but we plant seeds to rise
so when day comes pray so a miracle will keep it protected
some of us gotta go but you know it you expect it
i gotta believe in more than i seein something better than this whatever it is
i need a quate before my feeling is gone
maybe my feeling is wrong
but ill embrace it like a beautiful song
i feel something strong coming along
i cant explain what it is but im relaxed till my mind is gone

day destroys the night
night divides the day
reapers hold is tight
lord take my pain away

this feeling is hitting me hard my soul is scarred
the feeling is saw like im getting a message from god
believin in cause no one believes in the laws
the reason the strong breaks - a soul is lost
im searching for my soul in a myst of boldest insanity
id vanity my home is a warzone callamity randomly
tragedies happen im sick of this life
id give in a minute the vicapri is from stripe
gotta bond with the new brothers leditucci and
cheddars survival of our mothers would be proud of us
when the day comes and we rise the high of our faith
and nothing can touch us we dont the feel the mothers
now the bees inside of my head the life that i lead
left me for dead and lost on the path that i tread
i blade so many to rest from family to friends
we pretend it doesnt happen but when will it end

day destroys the night
night divides the day
reapers hold is tight
lord take my pain away

i gotta new thought in my mind in a matter of time
ill be in a sublime state of the spiritual kind
my family is holding me high theyre nervous inside
i can see in their eyes pride but the eyes dont lie
if the celebration continues ill follow my heart
and my home is being infected from the poisonous dart
its fallin apart i dont wanna see its demise
so imma have to make a difference to remember i tried
my brother and sister smiling as i leave in the night
my mother kisses me on the cheek and my father is quiet
no words need to be said as my patters begun cause
nothing can break the chain of a father and son
as i take a step in the street where my destiny lies
tryin to focus my nerves got my stomach in ties
rollin in a club god damn these people are young
but needs to be done so ill reach you over the hoe

day destroys the night
night divides the day
reapers hold is tight
lord take my pain awaycame back to life for your protection
back the dead of resurrection
we came to change the whole completion
take this game a new direction

last stop when the gas popped
when the kush blows free
and the low-lows drop
to photo-opt
no flash
we smash
get cash
cash out the fuckin spot

itâ•˙s a new day to bill
expect the hill
we grab the bill
the trip is real
donâ•˙t make pull out the steal link
cause all the commotion
and emotions kill

heat-seekers if the come seekers
serve your asses through the big speakers
anyone anywhere we on jack
blowing up another spot with the contract

bounce bounce bounce bounce

put him down

jump jump jump jump

bounce bounce bounce bounce

adrenalin maxed in bringing the raptor
we cap it and coming at ya
studio gangsters applying the actra

still print that real shit
im the dog in the cup
and real hard to deal with
how long have we heard you down
and broke down doors with the grimey sound

no surrender we push and enter
take over the scene and blaze the green
put a chill through ya body
when you saw my teeth
find yourself in the middle
where the pink convenes

dont slip on the misfits
coz the minute you popshit
the mic gets twisted
anytime anywhere we blast off
the right start as parted your ass off

bounce bounce bounce bounce
kill em up
tear em up
put him down

jump jump jump jump
if he acts tough
shut him up

bounce bounce bounce bounce
getting high
let him ride

jump jump jump jump
if you dont give a fuck

we blow smoke in the air to fill the nation
getting you high no hesitation
so hard to charge no complication
take another hit for respiration
legalise donâ•˙t criticize
coz one day you might understand who to symbolise
any man any woman gotta like that
first trying put a cape gotta fight back

let strip shows like flip mode
we make you bounce on the track
with sick flows and kick toe
dont trip in the marsh pit
its a danger to spray just for salts on toxic
were phenomenal so unstoppable
unlimited your just comical
stay back with slate jack way back
paybacks a bitch and we know how to play that

bounce bounce bounce bounce

uno memento
we came from the bottom and rose to the top
like the cream in your coffee burning hot
climbing the billboards for the number one spot
king or the block stop for a second to watch
look and learn and loose your top
no more bottles to drop
we still rolling
pockets swollen
were locked and loaded
and the scene exploded
and were solid as ever on any endeavour
cypress hill forever doesnt get any better
we came and saw and conquered it all
were hungry for more like the kids in darfur

[chorus][b-real]
it was a cold dark night in december
running from the po-pos the alleyway i enter
trying to hideaway when i stumbled on a gun
and nobodys knows nothing about where it came from
and nothing hotter then the summers in june
who knows how many souls they put in the tomb
when i picked it up man i felt alot of pain
like a shot thru the brain for reasons i cant explain
after it went away i felt a sudden change 
like i can do anything and dont get in my way
im scared for my family 
they couldnt understand with gun in my hand i became another man
no more running and hiding away from the cops
no more getting robbed from the dudes on the block
youre looking at a new man in the light of the sun
youre staring down the barrel of a dead mans gun

[chorus]
cuz you never know whats around them corners
enemies try to run up on us
so i keep that gun right by my side
if you want it you gotta take my life 
and if you got problems i got answers
one shot from the revolver can solve it
anyway you want it it dont matter
if you got hard imma go harder 
you gotta take my life

[b-real]
you walk into a dream and shit feels like a game
everyone is different but they all end up the same
even the places and the faces all change
at the end of the dream i could see the bullets rain
i thought it was me who brought these people to the death
til i noticed a funny thing i was standing on the left
looking at other people with their hands on the gun 
and pulling the trigger until their enemies were done
and with each hand that held the gun it got deeper
they ended a question against the shoulder of the reaper
they all look invincible with the weapon that was cursed
until it was their turn to ride in the hearse
seems like the history is passing down to me
cuz my finger was itching to go after my enemies
i welcome them all with the best on my chest
because i put em to the test
and laid those bodies to rest

[chorus]
cuz you never know whats around them corners
enemies try to run up on us
so i keep that gun right by my side
if you want it you gotta take my life 
and if you got problems i got answers
one shot from the revolver can solve it
anyway you want it it dont matter
if you got hard imma go harder 
you gotta take my life

[b-real]
spring for more pimpin
time passes by
and people are telling me about the look in my eye
sayin it seems theres a chip on my shoulder
and for some reason my attitude has gotten bolder
i knew it was true cuz i felt myself changin
but i dont care what they think cuz im still the same man
i dont show weakness anymore without a question
dont wanna be stressin and have to teach them rappers a lesson
never a time i felt so alive and situations i thrive like bees to a hive
i murder these new kids who got something against me
the thought of you talkin shit really fuckin offends me
in no time at all we come back to each other
seems like ive seen it before
swear it on my mother
shot rang out and my hands went numb
body on the floor with the dead mans gun

[chorus]
cuz you never know whats around them corners
enemies try to run up on us
so i keep that gun right by my side
if you want it you gotta take my life 
and if you got problems i got answers
one shot from the revolver can solve it
anyway you want it it dont matter
if you got hard imma go harder 
you gotta take my life
you gotta take my life
you gotta take my life
you gotta take my life
you gotta take my life[chorus]

[chorus]
strike the match

lone range
a brace to be a gangster

comin out pullin guns out on strangers
bunch a wild niggas
nobody can tame us
sixteen in the clip
one in the chamber
drive by homicide
shit i gotta roll a dime
ever day i ran away

i like to see heads get busted
a problem

[chorus]
strike the match
that sparks the flame
start the fire that burns down the system
hit em hard hit em fast
keep the gas on em
were gonna char
get the dogs go gas on em

post it on the top son
claw some
makin my way
through the jungle
living with the life
call something
evolving with each hustle
the street sweep
to a heatseeker
with ambitions to be a ring leader
when youre in the top spot
 you better be top notch 
if not watch the haters take pot shots
its none stop shit talkin
beat off the conflict
ready to harm him
disarm him
send his ass away in a coffin
my game is silent you dont see it that often
but every passing day i see the time slipping away
ticket on a train till an early grave
reap what you sough
never had a handout
had my hustles planed out
worked to get the brand out
you wish my luck would run out

[chorus]
strike the match
that sparks the flame
start the fire that burns down the system
hit em hard hit em fast
keep the gas on em
were gonna char
get the dogs go gas on em[chorus]

impacts on the wall something you cant get
you need a little heart but you thin man
got you on the yellow brick looking for the wizard like tin man
been in the game call me mvp
all your friends come with me to the vip
where we blow them trees and hold those gs
and all the birds in the flock distract referees
we blow out like a thief in the middle of the night game so tight
cant understand how they make on right
the hill on the other hand feels so right
just might hit your block and change your light
lets go
