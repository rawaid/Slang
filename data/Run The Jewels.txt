on the lam in a hatchback blasting some rap shit trying not to slam into traffic
with my feet on the wheel and my hands through the moon roof laughing

workers at the sweatshop kill they boss to how the vets drop
worker ants surround their queen and chew the bitchs head off
drug dogs bark at the tour bus when it park

she said it is what it is and we did what we did
right before we popped 3 caps and 3 stems
she popped that molly rocked my body i fly high and my co-pilot
psilocybin got me slidin slipping into another dimension
me and this woman made love in kemet
traveled to the moon came back when we were finished
fell to the earth lost each other died and we came back sister and brother
in that lifetime we couldnt have each other
so we killed ourselves and it killed our mother
true romance in one lap dance

those who handling damage control dont wish us the best luck
im a living in smoke type
floating with a grin over the moat type
harry allen on you bitch i believe no hype
closer to the edge than even we want to admit
if this dont go right
then assholes like myself are proven so right

all i want is a castle
and to move like a man with a minimum of harassment
the company of women with opinions and fat asses
thats my list of demands

never looked both ways ran in traffic
pops went away but i stayed vagrant
placed where the steel and cement became nature
love what you did with the place it looks gorgeous
cityscape where the blood of good men courses
and the dreamers are bull trapped in porcelain
take a knee to the gods and get horse shit
wanna live for the thrill theyll arrange it
got a bevy of imps to spit hatred
shitll get in your head and cause panic
have you desperately begging to get famous
get your dignity dirty and left orphaned
sanity on the fringe of distorted
who are they to just take shit and hoard it
who am i that i dont get my portion
the most impressionable minds get molested
and informed by manipulating forces
dont fret little man dont cry
they can never take the energy inside you were born with
knowing that understand you could never be poor
you already won the war you were born rich
you can only take the energy you had
going back to the realm or the home where your lord is
whoever whatever that lord is couldnt
give a fuck if you ever made fortunes
fuck anyone ever trying to run that bum shit
send em to the flames where the orcs live
them and the lost minds thinking theyre smarter than us
dont understand loves importance
and we can weaponize that bring em back to the truth
where the ashes and dust got formed in

killer mike

the powers that be even offered up reprieves
told us they aint take us out if we bow to our knees
but they can give that to the kings and
queens and the worshipers of idols and followers of things
cause i would rather be in the jungle with the savages
its kill or be killed and im working with the averages
my professor emeritus say we been cursed being brought to the americas
how you raise a whole human single parent no marriages no sense of heritage
planned parenthood helping plan miscarriages
but im lucky mommy already had a narrative
product of a teenage love
my arrogance to rise from the pride
and the job my parents did

ive never been much of shit by most measurements dont exist
on the radar a little blip in the shadow of mother ships
been smothered and brashly muffled by hucksters of global spin
like the sign on my back says stab me my soul is your little bitch
but maybe you should be careful when flipping a strangers switch
like assuming the war is won aint a symptom of arrogance
when nothing to lose a step up then everythings for the win
so we grin in the face of frauds and tell monsters to suck our dick
i live to spit on your grave my existence is to disgrace you
the kitten became a lion that look at your face like great food
thats why we got the people behind us
while other rappers are vaginas for the fame the jewel runners will always stay rude
motherfuck your permission was never yours to begin with
and every bar of the bitch shit you spit is your fucking prison

use all the pain that you’ve felt in your life as the currency go out and trade it for blood
you are not you
you are now us
we are the only ones that you can trust
you’ll become fear
they’ll become dust
before this moment you didnt mean much
you are the smoldering vessel of punishment born to do nothing but justify us
give us your empathy we’ll give you lust
let yourself go my son time to grow up
give up your childish obsession with questioning
anything we dont tell you is irrelevant

the lead em all to the mall and set ‘em off game
you wanna hang like hussain
eat a mile of my shit then put your lips to my true brain
and get the hash tag #fartnoise
i used to give a half-fuck now i just laugh
i barely blink when it gets bad maybe i’m class
i pull the ducts out my eyes i don’t cry i just cant
killer mike brought the fire pack
light it off the sinners of the city where the riots at
the living fuck boy eraser
carve initials in the wet cement right where you died at

[hook sl jones]

[verse 3 killer mike]
who wanna run a summer with the jewel runners
got your girlfriend hotter than two summers
everybody tough til they see them twos on em
then they do a number two in they true religions
lord please dont shoot they get too religious
truth is we go vicious on these doo pigeons
pistol pointed at they missus like i killed these bitches
we run the jewels and when we talking pimpin pay attention

[verse 4 el-p]
run the jewels we a bit odd
we bad news you barely get a fat chance to slim odds
you barely get a short plank for long walks taught like a sawn-off
no laws when i taught nah
and im kalashnikov spitting
we always take the time to smell the rose when it wither
id say better luck tomorrow
but the horror of your life is me and mike are just beginningkiller mike

el-p
you looking at the guy who the guy that you think that i got my style from got his own style from sup
i came with a sly wink and a shit grin with a pimp limp and a foul tongue
im a brooklyn son set adrift in a chemtrail sky
bad guys knock when the doors are locked i got no shots left better prep for god
not long hell be talkin the same shit i am just impossible
got a right to be hostile motherfucker life is a coffin layin down in it ain’t awesome
every single moment you spend in the dirt is a worse time than the last moment own it
we all know you dont know shit no shit

killer mike
and the obit goes like this here lies a punk bitch real fuck boy type
who never want shit bout as soft as his mommas own tit
and sensitive as his old ladys clit real bust-out bitch
she fuck my clique obscene absurd with the words
i cleaned up curbs with the blood and the bones of you nerds
i kill with the mic and murder with words
im known on the corners where murders occur i cruise in the verse where murderers lurk
when god in the building who they gonna hurt

el-p
not a butterfly bunny bee bird bein hurt
got a third-rock-from-the-sun claim for the turf
never learned how to love gimme brain then it burnt
yeah that hurts but at worst it will already start
with a curse in the heart thatll hurt til its worse

killer mike

no doubt i’m a dick fuck with me
liberty bell cracked the cops aren’t kidding
the rabbit in the hat is all deaf now aint it
came for the freedom stayed for the prison
came for the women stayed for the money
presidents are better worth dead to feed tummies
came for the brains stayed for the fucking
the money’s by the side of the bed it ain’t nothin
