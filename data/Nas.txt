hey yo black its time

aight nigga begin
nas
yeah straight out the fuckin dungeons of rap
where fake niggas dont make it back
i dont know how to start this shit yo now

verse one nas
rappers i monkey flip em with the funky rhythm i be kicking
musician inflictin compositions
of pain im like scarface sniffing cocaine
holding a m16 see with the pen im extreme
now bullet holes left in my peep holes
im suited up with street clothes
hand me a nine and ill defeat foes
yall know my steelo with or without the airplay
i keep some e&amp;j sitting bent up in the stairway
or either on the corner betting grants with the cee-lo champs
laughing at baseheads trying to sell some broken amps
g-packs get off quick forever niggas talk shit
reminiscing about the last time the task force flipped
niggas be running through the block shooting
time to start the revolution catch a body head for houston
once they caught us off guard the mac-10 was in the grass and
i ran like a cheetah with thoughts of an assassin
picked the mac up told brothers back up the mac spit
lead was hitting niggas one ran i made him backflip
heard a few chicks scream my arm shook couldnt look
gave another squeeze heard it click yo my shit is stuck
tried to cock it it wouldnt shoot now im in danger
finally pulled it back and saw three bullets caught up in the chamber
so now im jetting to the building lobby
and it was full of children probably couldnt see as high as i be
so what you saying its like the game aint the same
got younger niggas pulling the triggers bringing fame to they name
and claim some corners crews without guns are goners
in broad daylight stickup kids they run up on us
45s and gauges macs in fact
same niggasll catch a back to back
snatching your cracks in black
yo theres a snitch on the block getting niggas knocked
so hold your stash til the coke price drops
i know this crackhead who said she gotta smoke nice rock
and if its good shell bring ya customers and measuring pots
but yo you gotta slide on a vacation
inside information keeps large niggas erasing and they wives basin
it drops deep as it does in my breath
i never sleep cause sleep is the cousin of death
beyond the walls of intelligence life is defined
i think of crime when im in a new york state of mind

rakim sample
new york state of mind

verse two nas
be having dreams that im a gangster drinking moëts holding tecs
making sure the cash came correct then i stepped
investments in stock sewing up the blocks to sell rocks
winning gunfights with mega cops
but just a nigga walking with his finger on the trigger
make enough figures until my pockets get bigger
i aint the type of brother made for you to start testing
give me a smith &amp; wesson ill have niggas undressing
thinking of cash flow buddha and shelter
whenever frustrated ima hijack delta
in the pjs my blend tape plays bullets and strays
young bitches is grazed each block is like a maze
full of black rats trapped plus the island is packed
from what i hear in all the stories when my peoples come back black
im living where the nights is jet black
the fiends fight to get crack i just max i dream i can sit back
and lamp like capone with drug scripts sewn
or the legal luxury life rings flooded with stones homes
i got so many rhymes i dont think im too sane
life is parallel to hell but i must maintain and be prosperous
though we live dangerous cops could just
arrest me blaming us were held like hostages
its only right that i was born to use mics
and the stuff that i write is even tougher than dice
im taking rappers to a new plateau through rap slow
my rhyming is a vitamin held without a capsule
the smooth criminal on beat breaks
never put me in your box if your shit eats tapes
the city never sleeps full of villains and creeps
thats where i learned to do my hustle had to scuffle with freaks
im a addict for sneakers twenties of buddha and bitches with beepers
in the streets i could greet ya about blunts i teach ya
inhale deep like the words in my breath
i never sleep cause sleep is the cousin of death
i lay puzzled as i backtrack to earlier times
nothings equivalent to the new york state of mind

visualizing the realism of life in actuality
fuck whos the baddest a persons status depends on salary
and my mentality is money orientated
im destined to live the dream for all my peeps who never made it
cause yeah we were beginners in the hood as five percenters
but something mustve got in us cause all of us turned to sinners
now some rest in peace and some are sittin in san quentin
others such as myself are trying to carry on tradition
keeping this schweppervescent street ghetto essence inside us
cause it provides us with the proper insight to guide us
even though we know somehow we all gotta go
but as long as we leaving thievin
well be leavin with some kind of dough so
until that day we expire and turn to vapors
me and my capers will be somewhere stackin plenty papers
keeping it real packing steel getting high

i woke up early on my born day im twenty its a blessing
the essence of adolescence leaves my body now im fresh and
my physical frame is celebrated cause i made it
one quarter through life some godly-like thing created
got rhymes three sixty-five days annual plus some
load up the mic and bust one cuss while i pus from
my skull cause its pain in my brain vein money maintain
dont go against the grain simple and plain
when i was young at this i used to do my thing hard
robbin foreigners take their wallets their jewels and rip their green cards
dipped to the projects flashing my quick cash and
got my first piece of ass smokin blunts with hash
now its all about cash in abundance
niggas i used to run with is rich or doing years in the hundreds
i switched my motto stead of saying fuck tomorrow
that buck that bought a bottle couldve struck the lotto
once i stood on the block loose cracks produce stacks
i cooked up and cut small pieces to get my loot back
time is illmatic keep static like wool fabric
pack a four-matic to crack your whole cabbage

your telephone blown black stitches or fat shoelaces
peoples are petrol dramatic automatic 44 i let blow
and back down po-po when im vexed so
my pen taps the paper then my brains blank
i see dark streets hustling brothers who keep the same rank
pumping for something some will prosper some fail
judges hanging niggas incorrect bails for direct sales
my intellect prevails from a hanging cross with nails
i reinforce the frail with lyrics thats real
word to christ a disciple of streets trifle on beats
i decipher prophecies through a mic and say peace
i hung around the older crews while they sling smack to dingbats
they spoke of fat cat that niggas name made bell rings black
some fiends scream about supreme team a jamaica queens thing
uptown was alpo son heard he was kingpin yo
fuck rap is real watch the herbs stand still
never talking to snakes cause the words of man kill

dear born youll be out soon stay strong 
out in new york the same shit is going on 
the crack-heads stalking loud-mouths is talking

word to mother i heard him fronting 
and he be pumping on your block your man gave him your glock 
and now they run together what up son whatever 
since im on the streets ima put it to a cease 
but i heard you blew a nigga with an ox for the phone piece 
wiling on the island but now with el mara 
better chill cos them niggaz will put that ass on fire 
last time you wrote you said they tried you in the showers 
but maintain when you come home the corners ours 
on the reals all these crab niggaz know the deal 
when we start the revolution all they probably do is squeal 
but chill see you on the next vi 
i gave your mom dukes loot for kicks plus sent your flicks 
your brothers buck wiling in four maine he wrote me 
he might beat his case til he come home i play it low key 
so stay civilized time flies though incarcerated your mind dies
i hate it when your moms cries 
it kinda wants to make me murder for real-a 
ive even got a mask and gloves to bust slugs but one love

verse three 

sometimes i sit back with a buddha sack 
minds in another world thinking how can we exist through the facts 
written in school text books bibles etcetera 
fuck a school lecture the lies get me vexed-er 
so i be ghost from my projects 
i take my pen and pad for the weekend hitting ls while im sleeping 
a two day stay you may say i needed time alone 
to relax my dome no phone left the 9 at home 
you see the streets have me stressed something terrible 
fucking with the corners have a nigga up in belle vue 
or hdm hit with numbers from 8 to 10 
a future in a maximum state pen is grim 
so i comes back home nobodys out but shorty doo-wop
rolling two phillies together in the bridge we call them oowops 
he said nas niggaz could be busting off the roof 
so i wear a bullet proof and pack a black tres-deuce 
he inhaled so deep shut his eyes like he was sleep 
started coughing when i peeked to watch me speak 
i sat back like the mack my army suit was black 
we was chilling on these benches where he pumped his loose cracks 
i took the l when he passed it this little bastard 
keeps me blasted and started talking mad shit 
i had to school him told him dont let niggaz fool him 
cause when the pistol blows the one thats murdered be the cool one
tough luck when niggaz are struck families fucked up 
couldve caught your man but didnt look when you bucked up 
mistakes happen so take heed never bust up 
at the crowd catch him solo make the right man bleed 
shortys laugh was cold blooded as he spoke so foul 
only twelve trying to tell me that he liked my style 
then i rose wiping the blunts ash from my clothes 
then froze only the blow the herb smoke through my nose 
and told my little man that im a go cyprose 
left some jewels in the skull that he can sell if he chose

cold be walking with a bop and my hat turned back huh
love committing sins and my friends sell crack
this nigga raps with a razor keep it under my tongue
the school drop-out never liked the shit from day one
cause life aint shit but stress fake niggaz and crab stunts
so i guzzle my hennessey while pulling on mad blunts
the brutalizer buddha sizer accelerator
the type of nigga who be pissing in your elevator

used to sport ballys and gazelles with black frames
now im into fat chains sex and tecs
fly new chicks and new kicks heines and becks

represent represent repeat 3x

no doubt; see my stacks are fat this is what its about
before the bdp conflict with mc shan
around the time when shante dissed the real roxxane

visualizing the realism of life in actuality
fuck whos the baddest a persons status depends on salary
and my mentality is money orientated
im destined to live the dream for all my peeps who never made it
cause yeah we were beginners in the hood as five percenters
but something mustve got in us cause all of us turned to sinners
now some rest in peace and some are sittin in san quentin
others such as myself are trying to carry on tradition
keeping this schweppervescent street ghetto essence inside us
cause it provides us with the proper insight to guide us
even though we know somehow we all gotta go
but as long as we leaving thievin
well be leavin with some kind of dough so
until that day we expire and turn to vapors
me and my capers will be somewhere stackin plenty papers
keeping it real packing steel getting high
cause lifes a bitch and then you die

lifes a bitch and then you die
thats why we get high
cause you never know when youre gonna go
lifes a bitch and then you die

i woke up early on my born day im twenty its a blessing
the essence of adolescence leaves my body now im fresh and
my physical frame is celebrated cause i made it
one quarter through life some godly-like thing created
got rhymes three sixty-five days annual plus some
load up the mic and bust one cuss while i pus from
my skull cause its pain in my brain vein money maintain
dont go against the grain simple and plain
when i was young at this i used to do my thing hard
robbin foreigners take their wallets their jewels and rip their green cards
dipped to the projects flashing my quick cash and
got my first piece of ass smokin blunts with hash
now its all about cash in abundance
niggas i used to run with is rich or doing years in the hundreds
i switched my motto stead of saying fuck tomorrow
that buck that bought a bottle couldve struck the lotto
once i stood on the block loose cracks produce stacks
i cooked up and cut small pieces to get my loot back
time is illmatic keep static like wool fabric
pack a four-matic to crack your whole cabbage

when the cops came you shoulda slid to my crib 
fuck it black no time for looking back its done 
plus congratulations you know you got a son 
i heard he looks like you why dont your lady write you 
told her she should visit thats when she got hyper 
flippin talkin about he acts too rough 
ge didnt listen he be riffing while im telling him stuff 
i was like yeah shorty dont care she a snake too 
fucking with them niggaz from that fake crew that hate you 
but yo guess who got shot in the dome-piece 
jeromes niece on her way home from jones beach its bugged 
plus little rob is selling drugs on the dime 
hanging out with young thugs that all carry 9s 
at night time its more trife than ever 
whattup with cormega did you see em are yall together 
if so then hold the fort down represent to the fullest 
say whassup to herb ice and bullet 
i left a half a hundred in your commissary 
you was my nigga when push came to shove 
one what one love 

verse two 

dear born youll be out soon stay strong 
out in new york the same shit is going on 
the crack-heads stalking loud-mouths is talking 
hold check out the story yesterday when i was walking 
the nigga you shot last year tried to appear like he hurting something 
word to mother i heard him fronting 
and he be pumping on your block your man gave him your glock 
and now they run together what up son whatever 
since im on the streets ima put it to a cease 
but i heard you blew a nigga with an ox for the phone piece 
wiling on the island but now with el mara 
better chill cos them niggaz will put that ass on fire 
last time you wrote you said they tried you in the showers 
but maintain when you come home the corners ours 
on the reals all these crab niggaz know the deal 
when we start the revolution all they probably do is squeal 
but chill see you on the next vi 
i gave your mom dukes loot for kicks plus sent your flicks 
your brothers buck wiling in four maine he wrote me 
he might beat his case til he come home i play it low key 
so stay civilized time flies though incarcerated your mind dies
i hate it when your moms cries 
it kinda wants to make me murder for real-a 
ive even got a mask and gloves to bust slugs but one love

verse three 

sometimes i sit back with a buddha sack 
minds in another world thinking how can we exist through the facts 
written in school text books bibles etcetera 
fuck a school lecture the lies get me vexed-er 
so i be ghost from my projects 
i take my pen and pad for the weekend hitting ls while im sleeping 
a two day stay you may say i needed time alone 
to relax my dome no phone left the 9 at home 
you see the streets have me stressed something terrible 
fucking with the corners have a nigga up in belle vue 
or hdm hit with numbers from 8 to 10 
a future in a maximum state pen is grim 
so i comes back home nobodys out but shorty doo-wop
rolling two phillies together in the bridge we call them oowops 
he said nas niggaz could be busting off the roof 
so i wear a bullet proof and pack a black tres-deuce 
he inhaled so deep shut his eyes like he was sleep 
started coughing when i peeked to watch me speak 
i sat back like the mack my army suit was black 
we was chilling on these benches where he pumped his loose cracks 
i took the l when he passed it this little bastard 
keeps me blasted and started talking mad shit 
i had to school him told him dont let niggaz fool him 
cause when the pistol blows the one thats murdered be the cool one
tough luck when niggaz are struck families fucked up 
couldve caught your man but didnt look when you bucked up 
mistakes happen so take heed never bust up 
at the crowd catch him solo make the right man bleed 
shortys laugh was cold blooded as he spoke so foul 
only twelve trying to tell me that he liked my style 
then i rose wiping the blunts ash from my clothes 
then froze only the blow the herb smoke through my nose 
and told my little man that im a go cyprose 
left some jewels in the skull that he can sell if he chose 
words of wisdom from nas try to rise up above 
keep an eye out for jake shorty im out one lovethe buddha monks in your trunk turn the bass up
nas stories by aesop place your loot up parties i shoot up
nas i analyze drop a jew-el
inhale from the l school a fool well you feel it like braille
it aint hard to tell i kick the skill like shaquille holds a pill
vocabulary spills im ill
plus matic i freak beats slam it like iron shiek
jam like a tech with correct techniques
so analyze me surprise me but cant magmatize me
scannin while youre plannin ways to sabatoge me
i leave em froze like her-on in your nose
nasll rock well it aint hard to tell

verse ii needed

it aint hard to tell i excel then prevail
the mic is contacted i attract clientele
my mic check is life or death breathin a snipers death
i exhale the yellow smoke of buddha through righteous steps
deep like the shinin sparkle like a diamond
sneak a uzi on the island in my army jacket linin
hit the earth like a comet invasion
nas is like the afrocentric asian half-man half-amazin
cause in my physical i can express throuh song
delete stress like motrin then extend strong
i drank moet with medusa give her shotguns in hell
from the spliff that i lift and inhale it aint hard to tellyeah yeah
on the on the on the
on the real all you crab niggaz know the deal

finally up in this nigga
lets pay homage to illmatic
lets put the crown where its at
10 years
never been done this real by nobody

to my seed may i lead you into no greed or evil
in the categories of stories i breed my sequel
you know the money blues blunts broken 22s
monkey see monkey do
shorty sipping sunny dew
now its vsop in a phantom mad smoky
murder trees cruisin gat in the stash so it wont poke me
up in the trump plaza suite 3010 dont make no noise cause we dirty
tell them hoes hurry in
we got the room lit up with perfume and mad boom
and theres video taping bloomin asss on the zoomin lens
rollin on you nondescript niggaz
youre marked for death like colombians with bad coke that gyp niggaz
tilt the dutch twisted up the uwee if youre skilled enough
in will we trust salute the dead the nine mili busts

that verse is 10 years old 9½ years old
streets disciple
the rebirth comin at you this year baby
its on baby

yeah
to the hood may this be the day that we pop them bottles
this is mandatory what if theres not tomorrow
you know the murder rate jealousy you heard em say
he say she say im bout cheddar he dont deserve to make
sippin clear liquor with niggaz that talk sideways
listenin close to every word in case they violate
up in the projects apartment 5d
spark a lea its bout da reed countin everything the block see
we bout to need to take the corners from them cowards
get it on so yall can move more coke powder by the hour
hold in case we gotta rip niggaz
loaded - teflon coated projectilesll flip niggaz
from ninth grade to lightweight to grams to my mans with guns in hand
police vans they missed the summers again

yeah power to the people
death to the phonies
this beast to the mic 1 2 check
yall fed-e-rallies on me
and they look like you
approachin me like how you homie
the fbi see only one problem they try to slump me
after the young black male cuz he makes a lot of money
so hustlers make crack sales cuz they deprived and hungry
my country hates that i could run free state to state with hunnies
while makin cake with real golded plate rims on hum-vs
the bush stroker the kush smoker nigga
just when you thought it was over look over your shoulders
im 30 now baby sip drinks and sip em slow
motto no stress smokin less than i did befo
you see the kid was broke till i spitted vivid expressions of hard livin
ghetto children of a lesser god religion was fast women expensive cars
yall witnessin over 10 years - the best of nasyeah yeah yo yeah yeah

[verse 1]
for niggaz up in they moms crib listenin
to this unadulterated nas shit wishin it was then
instead a me on this track on this beach with palm trees
drinks with umbrellas straws telling it raw
jungle of concrete killers and snakes i was amongst that
bundles of crack through this funnel thats black
i want you to vision through my telescope see the hell i wrote
its reynolds when i wrap it like a envelope package
and they would send the dope back then
numbers pimpin and robbin well they still robbin and pimpin
but its small change compare to hip hoppin
and did i mention millions because of lip poppin
trips expensive gift shoppin whip drivin
benzes jeeps see them and they bitch got one
its shockin you thinkin naw its just rhymin
but all this time its like organized crimin
for instance there was a time when there was a line
between streets and business but now peep how its mixed in
the beef is now sickenin everybody got paper
words of power because of it the cops hate ya
the government watchin all of those who thuggin it
they wanna lock us up cause they kids are lovin it
not knowin that most rappers are straight ass
the shots ring out whenever we clash its star wars

[chorus]
we call it star wars
what happens when the shots ring out star wars
we call it star wars

[verse 2]
caviar never i rather the cajun blacken
catfish no snails simple nigga to please
met a bad bitch dimples in her cheeks
she remembers busy b battles when it was peace
caught myself driftin in thought cause now its different i thought
niggaz was raised off the shit i record
like i was brought up off that planet rock
kurtis blow james todd smith shan and scott larock in the jams
why would they fuck with a don jehovah witness
him and his co-defendants i eat em like lucky charms
with two percent low fat milk five percent pro black built
its nothin mother had a motherfucker
i dont think about it niggaz talkin theres a lot of gossip
that im a prophet or i cant go back to my projects
can i does a plant grow from a plant yes
do trees grow from a forest mcs yall are clitoris
yall niggaz roll with any click thats winnin any crew
doin whatevers trendy even they leave me too
aint enough room in this town
what is beef between ghetto word spitters with crowns star wars

[chorus]
cause this is star wars shots ring out everywhere star wars
cause this is star wars shots ring out

[verse 3]
this aint no oscars or mtv or joan rivers fashion police
not what you read in tabloid seats
these are mcs that live by the code its hard for me to spit it
because the game was supposed to be sold we livid
came from the streets we the voice of the youth
americas nightmare was given a the mic booth
nike boots leathers and jean jewelry cribs and cars
rappers not dependin on your nine to five jobs
entertainment this is our world this is our language
different regions speakin east and west gang shit
you got your positive shit like common sense
but even he had drama with the don mega cube
acknowledge the words get twisted at times its rules
what you think is different from the block whenever we feud
fuck your pictures and your plaques your tours and autographs
dont trust bitches and niggaz who tell you your all of that
cause theyll be in your enemies face sayin its safe
to run in your release party sprayin the place
or catch you when you least on point putting your keys in the door
behind you with your seeds in kay bee toys store
maybe the words get disrespectful now your niggaz check you
you gon let that nigga play you you know we gon rep you

red dot plots murder schemes 32 shotguns 
regulate with my dunns 17 rocks gleam
from one ring yo let me let yall niggaz know one thing
theres one life one love so there can only be one king
the highlights of living vegas style roll dice in linen
anteras spinning on millenniums
20g bets im winning them threats im sending them
lex with tv sets the minimum ill sex adrenaline
party with villains a case of demi-sec to chase the henny
wet any clique with the semi-tech who want it
diamonds i flaunt them chicken heads flock i lace them
fried broiled with basil taste them
crack your legs way out of formation
its horizontal how i have them fucking me in the benz wagon
can it be vanity from last dragon
grab gun its on though shit is grimy real niggaz buck in broad daylight
with the broke mac it wont spray right
dont give a fuck what they hit as long as the dramas lit
yo overnight thugs bug because they aint promised shit
hungry-ass hooligans stay on that piranha shit

[chorus]

[nas]
i peeped you fronting i was in the jeep sunk in
the seat tinted with heat beats bumping
across the street you was wilding
talking bout how you ran the island in 89 laying up playing the yard with crazy shine
i cocked a baby 9 that nigga gave me mine click
what was he thinking on my corner when it pay me time
dug em you owe me cousin something told me plug them
so dumb felt my leg burn then it got numb
spun around and shot one heard shots and dropped son
caught a hot one somebody take this biscuit before the cops come
then they came asking me my name what the fuck
i got stitched up and went through the left hospital that same night
what i got my gat back time to backtrack
i had to drop so how the fuck i get clapped
black was in the jeep watching all these scenes speed by
it was a brown datsun and yo nobody in my hood got one
that clown niggas through blazing out his crew daily
the bridge touched me up severely hear me
so when i rhyme its sincerely yours be lighting ls sipping coors
on all floors in project halls
contemplating war with niggas i was cool with before
we used to score together uptown copping the raw
but a a thug changes and love changes
and best friends become strangers word up

[outro nas]
yo to them thug niggas getting it on in the world ya know
to them thug niggas that locked down doing their thing
surviving know what im saying

yo to the queens bridge militia 9-6 shit the firm clique
the illmatic nigga it was written though
been a long time coming
yall fake niggas trying to copy
better come with the reloaduhh what what uhh 

chorus nas set to eurythmics sweet dreams 

street dreams are made of these 
niggaz push beemers and 300 es 
a drug dealers destiny is reaching a key 
everybodys looking for somethin 
street dreams are made of these 
shorties on they knees for niggaz with big gs 
who am i to disagree 
everybodys looking for something 

[nas] 
my man put me up for the share one-fourth of a square 
headed for delaware with one change of gear 
nothing on my mind but the dime sack we blazed 
with the glaze in my eye that we find when we crave 
dollars and cents a fugitive with two attempts 
jakes had no trace of the face now they drew a print 
though im innocent til proven guilty 
ima try to filthy purchase a club and start up a realty 
for real g ima fulfil my dream 
if i conceal my scheme then precisely ill build my cream 
the first trip without the clique 
sent the bitch with the quarter brick this is it 
fresh face ny plates got a crooked i for the jakes 
i want it all armorall benz and endless papes 
gods sake what nigga got to do to make a half million 
without the fbi catching feelings 

chorus 

[nas] 
from fat cat to papi niggas see the cat 
twenty-five to flat push a thousand feet back 
holding gats wasnt making me fat snitches on my back 
living with moms getting it on flushing crack down the toilet 
two sips from being alcoholic 
nine hundred ninety nine thou from being rich but now im all for it 
my man saw it like dionne warwick 
a wiser team for a wiser dream we could all score with 
the cartel argentina coke with the nina 
up in the hotel smoking on sessamina 
trina got the fishscale between her 
the way the bitch shook her ass yo the dogs never seen her 
she got me back living sweeter fresh caesar 
guess david robinsons walle moccasins 
bitches blow me while hopping in the drop-top bm 
word is bond son i had that bitch down on my shit like this 

chorus 

[nas] 
growing up project-struck looking for luck dreaming 
scoping the large niggas beaming check what im seeing
cars ghetto stars pushing ill europeans 
gn heard about them old timers odn 
young early 80s throwing rocks at the crazy lady 
worshipping every word them rope rocking niggaz gave me 
the street raised me up giving a fuck 
i thought jordans and a gold chain was living it up 
i knew the dopes the pushers the addicts everybody 
cut out of class just to smoke blunts and drink naughty 
aint that funny getting put on to crack money 
with all the gunplay painting the kettle black hungry 
a case of beers in the staircase i wasted years 
some niggas went for theirs flipping coke as they career 
but im a rebel stressing to pull out of the heat no doubt 
with jeeps tinted out spending never holding out 

chorus 2xnas] 
damn look how muh-fuckers use a nigga

i cant believe this shit 
word up word up 

i seen some cold nights and bloody days they grab me bullets spray
they use me wrong so i sing this song til this day 
my body is cold steel for real 
i was made to kill thats why they keep me concealed 
under car seats they sneak me in clubs 
been in the hands of mad thugs 
they feed me when they load me with mad slugs 
seventeen precisely one in my head 
they call me desert eagle semi-auto with lead 
im seven inches four pounds been through so many towns 
ohio to little rock to canarsie living harshly 
beat up and battered they pull me out 
i watch as niggaz scattered making me kill 
but what i feel it never mattered 
when im empty im quiet finding myself fiending to be fired 
a broken safety niggaz place me in shelves 
under beds so i beg for my next owner to be a thoroughbred 
keep me full up with hollow heads 

chorus nas repeat 2x 

how you like me now i go blaow 
its that shit that moves crowds making every ghetto foul 
i might have took your first child scarred your life crippled your style 
i gave you power i made you buck wild 

[nas] 
always im in some shit my abdomen is the clip 
the barrel is my dick uncircumcised 
pull my skin back and cock me i bust off when they unlock me 
results of what happens to niggaz shock me 
i see niggaz bleeding running from me in fear stunningly tears 
fall down the eyes of these so-called tough guys for years 
ive been used in robberies giving niggaz heart to follow me 
placing peoples in graves funerals made cause i was sprayed 
i was laid in a shelf with a grenade 
met a wrecked-up teck with numbers on his chest that say 
five-two-oh-nine-three-eight-five and zero 
had a serial defaced hoping one day police would place 
where he came from a name or some sort of person to claim him 
tired of murdering made him wanna be a plain gun 
but yo i had some other plans like the next time the beef is on 
i make myself jam right in my owners hand 

chorus 

[nas] 
yo weeks went by and im surprised 
still stuck in the shelf with all the things that an outlaw hides 
besides me its bullets two vests and then a 9 
theres a grenade in a box and that teck that kept crying 
cause he aint been cleaned in a year hes rusty as clear 
hes bout to fall to pieces cause of his murder career 
yo i can hear somebody coming in open the shelf 
his eyes bubbling he said it was on 
i felt his palm troubled him shaking
somebody stomped him out his dome was aching
he placed me on his waist the moment ive been waiting
my creation was for blacks to kill blacks 
its gats like me that accidentally go off making niggaz memories 
but this time its done intentionally 
he walked me outside saw this cat cocked me back said remember me 
he pulled the trigger but i held on it felt wrong 
knowing niggaz is waiting in hell for him 
he squeezed harder i didnt budge sick of the blood 
sick of the thugs sick of wrath of the next mans grudge 
what the other kid did was pull out no doubt 
a newer me in better shape before he lit out he lead the chase 
my owner fell to the floor his wig split so fast 
i didnt know he was hit its over with 
heard mad niggas screaming niggaz running cops is coming 
now im happy until i felt somebody else grab me 
damn[nas]
they never realized how real nas is so decisive
its just the likeness of israelites mist that made me write this
a slight twist of lime rhyme be chasing down your prime time
food for thought or rather mind wine
the don juan features the freak shit my thesis
on how we creep quick fucking your wife that aint so secret
its mandatory - see that pussy they hand it to me
i got no game its just some bitches understand my story
there aint no drama that my niggaz never handle for me
my gator brand is maurry walking through rough land before me
where the snakes put a smile on they face hoping and praying im stuck
scoping they lay in the cut weighing my luck
player haters play this in cell blocks and rock stages
winking at some females cops with cocked gauges
really its papers im addicted to wasnt for rap then ill be sticking you
the mag inside the triple goose
face down on the floors the routine
dont want hear nobody blow steam just cream or its a smoke screen
imagine that - thats why i hardly kick the bragging raps
i zone to each his own and this ghetto inhabitant

igloos of ice tricking on you you never listen 
to this nigga spending franklins on tennis anklets
mustve had a bad deal in the past though
cant even keep it real with a nigga with cash flow
say men are all the same what we need to do is break this chain

with dreams to settle down it aint far from now

typical day that the black girl sees
coming home wanting more from a college degree

drop them off letting some nigga knock you off

growing up seeing it it should remind you you being lied to
everything that move be inside you
sacred as you are left with these wannabes to guide you
i watched you hard to knock you i tried not to
they spot you out dancing topless in your drawers

film all the bitches on the benches with ill extensions 
we block the streets off only crew cars can enter 
music was loud and it was crowded 
barbecued wings we fed the fiends gamble in the back killa shouted 
and frank tried to stop the bank loss about what a roley cost 
guzzled his drink and staggered off

couldnt take losing his cash and i could feel 
something in the air yeah frank returned with pierre 
a gun slinger who niggas hadnt seen in a year

and everyone except for me had started reaching

and grandmothers around franks only concern was his paper

life
i wonder 
will it take me under
i dont know 

verse one nas 

imagine smoking weed in the street without cops harassing 
imagine going to court with no trial 
lifestyle cruising blue bahama waters 
no welfare supporters more conscious of the way we raise our daughters 
days are shorter nights are colder 
feeling like life is over these snakes strike like a cobra 
the worlds hot my son got knocked evidently 
its elementary they want us all gone eventually 
trooping out of state for a plate of knowledge 
if coke was cooked without the garbage wed all have the top dollars 
imagine everybody flashing fashion 
designer clothes lacing your clique up with diamond roles
your people holding dough no parole no rubbers
going raw imagine law with no undercovers 
just some thoughts for the mind 
i take a glimpse into time watch the blimp read the world is mine 

chorus lauryn hill nas 

if i ruled the world
imagine that 
id free all my sons
i love em love em baby 
black diamonds and pearls
could it be if you could be mine wed both shine 
if i ruled the world
still living for today in these last days and times 

verse two nas 

yo itll be paradise life relaxing black latino and anglo-saxon 
armani exchange the range
cash lost tribe of shabazz free at last 
brand new whips to crash then we laugh in the iller path 
the villa houses for the crew how we do 
trees for breakfast dime sexes and benz stretches 
so many years of depression make me vision 
the better living type of place to raise kids in 
opening eyes to the lies historys told foul 
but im as wise as the old owl plus the gold child 
seeing things like i was controlling clique rolling 
tricking six digits on kicks and still holding
trips to paris i civilized every savage 
gimme one shot i turn trife life to lavish 
political prisoner set free stress free 
no work release purple m3s and jet skis 
feel the wind breeze in west indies 
i make coretta scott-king mayor the cities and reverse fiends to willies 
it sounds foul but every girl i meet will go down town 
id open every cell in attica send em to africa 

chorus lauryn hill nas 

if i ruled the world
imagine that 
id free all my sons
i love em love em baby 
black diamonds and pearls
could it be if you could be mine wed both shine 
if i ruled the world
still livin for today in these last days and times 

and then well walk right up to the sun 
hand in hand 
well walk right up to the sun 
we wont land 
well walk right up to the sun 
hand in hand 
well walk right up to the sun 
we wont land 

verse three nas 

youd love to hear the story how the thugs live in worry 
duck down in car seats heats mandatory 
running from jake getting chased hunger for papes 
these are the breaks many mistakes go down out of state 
wait i had to let it marinate we carry weight 
trying to get laced flip the ace stack the safe 
millionaire plan to keep the gat with the cocked hammer
making moves in atlanta back and forth scrambler 
cause you could have all the chips be poor or rich 
still nobody want a nigga having shit 
if i ruled the world and everything in it skys the limit 
i push a q-45 infiniti
it wouldnt be no such thing as jealousies or b felonies 
strictly living longevity to the destiny 
i thought id never see but reality struck 
better find out before your times out what the fuck 

chorus lauryn hill nas

silent silent
murder

[nas]
its sort of like the conclusion the colour purple
niggas is losing confusion with one time all pursuit moves in
grabbing niggas up in this movement to rule shit
cop verses the block shorties in school quick
lesson number one if youre arrested and hung
where niggas is from gotta keep a lid on your tongue
its like silent murder i hit blunts hard like ray mercer
the violent words of a prince in the palace of persia
the cognac plurger plus the trees
but whose the foul one to make his nose take a freeze
and got enough gold to rock ice in all hype
used to be a general but just lost his stripe
pipe dreams and white fiends and all-nighters collect calls from lifers
astoria walls with cypress
since i got a problem with the law-writers
i kick some more items just to explore horizons
the palm lady dreamt of this day so ima play
the crib close smoking with the big toast and lay

chorus

they say the arms of nicki barnes would be enough to blast
a lot of rich niggas fell and started pumping gas
was it the mind of cia that bumped off malik shabazz
fuck what they teach in class ima reach the mass
strap up no back up its jungle tactics
living practice out of line niggas get smacked backwards
so wear it if the cap fits fold it up money and mad clips
a stack right under my mattress
to smoke a nigga like a hugh bros motion picture
niggas getting open cruise whooping older niggas
april fools they laugh the jokes on the benches
cease outside my nigga spoke on his sentence

chorus x4 +
silent
silent silent
murder

my right handers never play too close to cameras
its night time scanners circle the loud gamblers
peace-making niggas pep talk
the peace-making niggas walk off the hot avenues with they brew
time to get this loot countless cos sun it aint no youth fountains
niggas take cash and shoot bounce and pakistanians is took hostage
locked up inside a linen closet known for spending pies up
whats the flavour when your neighbours do jake favours
lock them real niggas down and letting fake players
roam around the project this lyrical logic i dilute
the weak can object the right composite
were plotting all murderous schemes
it seems im ghostly called by the essence of queens
the palm lady dreamt of this day so ima play
the crib close smoking with the big toast and lay

chorus x6

and cain killed his brother abel when god accepted abels 
offering and not his
abels offering showed that cain was not giving his best to god
and cains jealous anger drove him to murder -
drove him to murdercauseiam whatever you say i am if i wasnt then why would i say i am in
the radio the news everyday i am -i dont know but thats just the way i am

im so sick and tired of being admired that i just wish that i would die or get

of hearing my name oh my name wherever i go i just cant sit or relax when im 
eating with my daughter so peacefully

broken glass in the hallway bloodstained floors
neighbors look at every bag you bring through your doors
lock the top lock momma shoulda cuffed me to the radiator
why not it mightve saved later from my block
ny cops hookers crawlin off the stroll coughin
stitches in they head stinkin and i dread thinkin they be snitchin
but who else could it be shook at these unmarked vans
parked in the dark -- narcs wheres your heart
hustlers starve; they bust a u-e i jog
to my building -- come out later wearin camouflage
see the sergeant and the captain -- strangle men
niggaz gaspin for air; til they move no more and just stare
with dead eyes -- tired of riots shit is quiet
simple-minded fools infiltrate grimy crews
overcrowded cribs uncles home from bids sisters pregnant
fathers on drugs moms is smokin beds is piss-infested
had eight partners growin up eight turned to seven
seven turned to six niggaz got two in heaven
six of us holdin it now its five rollin thick
the sixth ones parole flipped; five niggaz went to fo quick
when he went ot college life converted into gangbangin
four niggaz still hangin years passed and slang changin
three of us now fourth nigga aint around
we all thought he was real -- he did the snake shit
fake shit -- beat his ass down yo his mouth
couldve got us all wasted what a f**kin clown
all i got left in the end is two of my best friends
and we all goin out to the death for these ends what

machine gun funk  from queens i came through to smoke blunts 
you came to my hood we was broke 
i wonder if we stayed that way would there have been gunsmoke 
still on the block around fiends numb from coke i guess so 
cause now with paper shit is still ghetto 
but fuck it black you livin your life though your loved ones 
peace to your daughter and your newborn son 
it used to be fun makin records to see your response 
but now competition is none now that youre gone 
and these niggaz is wrong -- usin your name in vain 
and they claim to be new yorks king it aint about that 
its more serious i plan to toast it up with you 
joke with you happy we on top the most official 
aint too many real ones out there; i feel some 
but doubt theyre capable to take it where you took it to 
i missed your wake not cause im fake 
cause i hate to see somebody so great in that way 
i woulda stayed so long with so much to say 
i had to put it in writin to keep me and brooklyn from fightin 
tellin me to pay my respects and move to the side 
but i probably wouldnt have got off my knees to let people by 
you cant kill nothin thats  ready to die  
you was like god to us in the form of allah 

still somehow i believe we always survive but why 

[nas] 
still we will survive 
no matter what my people just stay alive 
still we will survive 
no matter what my people just stay alive 

thug life never die 

dear pac every thug sheds a tear drop -- and use teeth 
to bite off beer tops and  pour out a lil liquor  
you was more than just the wildest nigga 
+2pacalypse+ i understand your style nigga 
its goin on the third year since youve been gone 
on the east and west coast the same shit is goin on 
the industry be talkin offendin me often 
they dont believe you dead wanna see you in your coffin 
i can relate shootouts and court dates 
+all eyez on you+ niggaz in your face invadin your space 
you asked if i could trade in your place how would i hold up 
how long would i ride before i fold up 
how did you know through your rhymes it was your time to go 
you predicted it in every line all in your flow 
there could  never be peace  i have to quote 
cant believe i heard my name on the realest shit you ever wrote 
we had words cause the best supposed to clash at the top 
but kept it brotherly when we seen each other and stopped 
in nyc at mtv people watched 
we was both deep after you left i got no sleep 
think about how us real niggaz would be 
if we united a nation of thugs who could fight it 
you was caught in a wild homicide or were you crucified 
like the son of god when lucifer lied 
and make the world think young blacks should be extinct 
but thug lifell never die we stay high and just link 
will there ever be another mc as nice 
will you return to us like the resurrection of christ 

still somehow i believe we always survive but why 

[nas] 
still we will survive 
no matter what my people just stay alive 
still we will survive 
no matter what my people just stay alive 

i wonder what the commodores went through on tour 
did smokey robinson have to shoot his way out a war 
what has al green seen that made him religious 
was it the drugs -- put an end to the music business 
if so should i put out the indo right now and write down 
a plan and pursue my dream turn my life around 
cause im bound for the movie screen cuties that scream 
ill need a extra uzi riding through my own hood in queens 
it be the ones you always knew that want it on 
tellin everybody it was him that you fronted on 
thought we walked a million miles it was just twenty 
not used to walkin in the path of legit money 
i thought i made it but we only took baby steps 
up the success ladder where they pay me checks 
to my clicks when i got it i said baby bless 
that was the 80s but now look at this crazy mess 
we in the 90s and finally its lookin good 
hip-hop took it to billions i knew we would 
a lot of ups and downs in the game could lose or gain 
a couple pounds tryin to maintain -- one day you here 
the next you not; when you around niggaz check em out 
some is bout it most individuals plots 
and run the spots some choose to stay to theyselves 
while others have no cares and stay in jail 
more than fifty percent of us 
endin up with holes through the chest 
through the head through the gut it shows 
the future for us young shooters and old killers 
who become rich as dope dealers 
nothing left for us but hoop dreams and hood tournaments 
thug coaches with subs sittin on the bench; either that or rap 
we want the fast way outta this trap 
whether it be 9 to 5 or slangin crack 
to my deceased gods wishin i could bring you back 
but life is a dream and yall taught me that 

 always survive but why 

[nas]

still we will survive 
no matter what my people just stay alive

as the night close down on the earth like gray dark rings
light of cities in the nights destination for kings
with big dreams like castro overthrew bautista
for cuba and pointed nukes toward the us
about to shoot us for revolution thats how you gotta move
a lotta rules some locked in solitude
curse the day of they birth confused whos to be praised
the mighty dollar or almighty allah
im like the farmer plantin words people are seeds
my truth is the soil help you grow like trees
may the children come in all colors change like leaves
behold before you one of those prophetic mcs
with blunted flows seven hundred souls in me
each channelin from past to present times heaven shines
light on those innocent to how the world grows
some men become murderers and some girls become hoes
and you accounted for everything that you heard
do not speak to fools they scorn the wisdom of your words
my heart is wise bloodshot eyes the saga never dies

yo we gotta be gods children habitats in tall buildins
rats crawlin filthy hallways incinerators
sinners who faithless still theres hope prayers answered
dreams turned real whats a wicked nation
one with blind men not takin charge of the situation
empty arguments some real conversations needed
the worldll need it to hear it
evil tried to weaken my spirit its chronic herb
this hurt come from the honest word
i now try hardest to serve my maker what i learn
find its way on the paper so i could dictate it
articulate it luckily i was put on one of the ships that made it
through strong currents and winds that left the others stranded
to sink in the atlantic
satan jigs the planet not to get too religious but
who decides when and if your life is finished
if christ is in us for the sake of your name oh lord
may we break away from the chains abroad

you wanna buy time  im the seller of minutes
i give you every second low-priced if i so lies; the truth is
time waits for none of you in fact
he cant wait for the date to snatch the ground right from under you
small visions of better life if cheddar was right
lurk in the mind of young ones ahead of they time
trapped in the slums beggin for nuttin but takin
headed for nuttin but the state pen where they cousins be waitin
judges is not relatin to pleas guns bustin where the kids play
richochet off lamp poles and leave damp holes
in bystanders get cancelled doa
around the way where we from
hope the future reduce the rate of those buried young
life is every mans kingdom a dyin mans past
in a newborns first time to be here at last
it shouldnt have to grow up fast and suffer our pain
hustlin harder than the generations here before he came
goin through the same bullshit as our fathers
read the history but whos the authors
for some the game is easy for most of us the game is much harder
but never lose faith; through the years just get smarter

freedom or jail clips inserted a babys bein born
same time a man is murdered the beginning and end
as far as rap go its only natural i explain
my plateau and also what defines my name
first it was nasty but times have changed
ask me now im the artist but hardcore my science for pain
i spent time in the game kept my mind on fame
saw fiends shoot up and do lines of cocaine
saw my close friends shot flatline am i sane
that depends carry mac-10s to practice my aim
on rooftops tape cd covers to trees
line the barrel up with your weak picture then squeeze
street scriptures for lost souls in the crossroads
to the corner thugs hustlin for cars that cost dough
to the big dogs livin large takin it light
pushin big toys gettin nice enjoyin your life
is what you make it suicide few try to take it
belt tied around they neck in jail cells naked
heaven and hell rap legend prescence is felt
and of course n - a - s are the letters that spell

nas is like earth wind &amp; fire rims and tires
bulletproof glass inside is the realest driver
planets in orbit line em up with the stars
tarot cards you can see the pharaoh nas
nas is like iron mike messiah type
before the christ after the death
the last one left let my cash invest in stock
came a along way from blastin techs on blocks
went from seiko to rolex ownin acres
from the projects with no chips to large cake dough
dimes givin fellatio siete zeros
bet my nine spit for the pesos
but whats it all worth cant take it when you under this earth
rich men died and tried but none of it worked
they just rob your grave id rather be alive and paid
before my numbers called historys made
somell fall but i rise thug or die
makin choices that determine my future under the sky
to rob steal or kill im wondering why
its a dirty game is any man worthy of fame
much to success to ya even if you wish me the opposite
sooner or later well all see who the prophet is

chorus

[nas]
nas is like sex to a nympho but nothin sweet
im like beef bustin heat through your windows
im like a street sweeper greenleaf reaper

im like a whole lot of loot im like crisp money
corporate accounts from a rich company
im like ecstasy for ladies im like all races
combined in one man; like the 99 summer jam
bulletproof hummer man
im like being locked down around new faces and none of em fam
im the feelin of a millionaire spendin a hundred grand

like out in beverly hills she wanna live one day
i can get with that i dropped you off home 
i call you hit me back

half my car half my kids  cant get that 
tried to swing on the god had to dip that

hook 2x to fadekissing

heart-broken she walked right out of mad niggas life
so when i bagged her up right i had to make her my wife
and i aint gonna loose her like those other lames did

pacino life g a roll casino dice
at the mirage vegas strip neon lights
gamblers puffin cigars couples and stars
flashin cameras dealers shufflin cards
spent the weekend already miss new york and its odd
cause im the first to say it got too many hustlers who rob
i never hang out when we do we bust the four-five
cause shells comin back at us while we jump in the ride
flyin duckin our bitches in the club cluckin
tellin my wife who i was dancin with like i was fuckin
flew back monday evening from the bottom where the sun was beamin
to the concrete jungle of cement
limousines from laguardia airport sleepin
told my dogs peace kept in movin i was beat when
got to my crib where the hell my keys went
ringin the bell heard a yell but wasnt sure
dropped my luggage to the ground put my ear to the door
slow music h-town no thats down low
my babys drop mercedes is parked i creep around yo
to the back she must be inside and cant hear
probably upstairs in the mirror doin her hair
i walked in through the back door entrance
shocked it was unlocked when i walked in i smelled incense
chased by a weed aroma empty guinnesses
and lipstick marks on like three empty coronas
a pair of blue jeans on the carpet; size 12 timberlands
somethin swingin on the ceilin fan i stopped it
swingin slower and slower
on the last swing i saw it was a g-string and heard laughin
thought about my nine-side glock but somethin made me disregard it
started my way up to where the noise and music was at
froze i couldnt react
bedroom door opened a crack seen wifey layin with some nigga
mumblin shit he had one hand on her ass
and she was rubbin his dick toastin wine glasses
cherry scented candles was lit couldnt handle the shit
searchin for  some   words i found none without a sound
i left the house with a sick smile and took my gun
now im out buggin whylin what im gon do
call my man horse meet me outside im comin through

{nas singing}
i thought you loved me
i thought you cared for me
i thought you needed me
didnt you believe in me * repeat 2x *

[nas]
got up with horse showed a look on my face was mad lost
i aint know whether to cry or just try to laugh it off
son you home early -- they wiped you out that quick
i said nah showed him the plastic with nine in the clip
hopped in the whip popped in the disc pressed play
to the grand central from the van wyck expressway
i said bet youll never guess in a million years
what i just saw happenin -- and probably still is
snuck in my crib - some nigga fuckin my wiz
i saw dem they aint see me i ducked and i slid
ima grab shorty i need you to grab the nigga for me
just when i thought i found love she shitted on me
shopped in vegas a present for our engagement
20 gs on a ring i would have hit her today with
my surprise couldnt match the one she had for me
we pulled up he was walkin out the house backwardly
parked in the back of my house they couldnt see us
ran to the side of my house cocked the heater
walked to the front when i talked he had junk
bitch tried to slam the door shut got caught in horse foot
shot the spanish kid in the rib drug him in
grabbed her face say goodbye to your undercover friend
one between the eye shes died by mistake
mustve held the gat too tight pointed at her face
heard somebody knock -- horse helped me hide the bodies
heard si-rens i guess we goin out we out like kamikazes
we surrounded red lights flashin whos inside
came out a bullhorn im contemplatin suicide
horse asked me for the mac he gave me dap one love
cocked the strap then he ran out the back
mad shots couldnt tell what was goin on
sat on the floor near my dead girl put her in my arms
pulled her ring out my pocket i was savin
put it on her ring finger cocked the glock and started prayin
to muhammad and allah the most beneficial
through you all things are possible i know youre listenin
i never meant for this to happen i never dreamed
thisd be my fate such a grotesque murder scene
on that note same time the cops busted in
kissed my lady her blood on my lips i said amen
put the nine to my head pulled the hammer held her close
squeeze the toast said to her now unto god we elope

 we elope

i never thought bein a man you could hang in the end
facin life with no parol and consecut sentencin
got people witnessin your co-defendent snitchin
your back against the wall your left eye is twitchin
loyal ladies usual a d-and as the mutual
scared to face the light of a courtroom site
racist cops on each side cause the know i just might
make a break for the door but i give it my all
if i die in this struggle give my momma a call
cause she always left these jewels what goes up must fall
since i fell dead broke landed in jail
refused to face the facts how wifey skipped to town with the bail
im on my own now v8 far away from home now
palmer wealth state the law changes each date
secret inditements got me knocked there aint no price i can pay
to get me the fuck up out this shit so to allah i pray
for forgiveness - yes i sinned and i need to be held
and jail aint no place a black man wanna be killed
amen

i only pray when shit is fucked up
i only pray when my life is lookin bad luck

[wiz]
i look up at the sky why do young niggas die
felt the stray hit me somebody stay with me
fallin to the ground with the sound of a four-pound near me
bitches screamin wish i was dreamin

feel like a head shot but maybe just grazed my temple
niggas diggin in my pockets sayin i just rolled a pimple
yo my mouth was movin but it was nothin i was sayin
only if they knew deep inside my mind i was prayin
amen

i only pray when shit is fucked up

when i come through buckin this four-fivin
revenge you sayin you gettin

so i check out the preacher - life is off the meter
thoughts of homicide tryin to dodge the reaper
confessions in a church cause it hurts behind a curtain
nigga talkin to me but i aint certain
voice sound familiar so i pulled the shade back
it was this stupid nigga that i popped way back
he set me up he just got to the preist
i tried to reach but he had his heat pointed my way
and said pray

[nas]
youve got to pray huh i mean pray pray
and when you pray you got to look up to the lord huh
you got to look up and you got to pray for your children huh
you got to pray for that man in front of the liquor store huh
you got to pray for that man on the corner he know he doin wrong
but somebody gotta pray for him huh you know we doin wrong
but we gotta pray for ourselves you know we are headin
to this new millennium goddamnit they say a comet is comin
to this world by the year two-thousand i say its god its up to you
to pray to that higher power higher than yourself and humble yourself
and and and beg for forgiveness cause it comes back to you
a man told me that while he was in jail all he did was pray
all he did was stay in his jail cell and pray to god[rich nice]
whats happenin brothers and sisters

afro-angels hide my weapons in tangles
black star spangled fragile like hematite with the east oils i write
in spite the lack of sunlight got my battle boots tight
now that the governments gone cant tell your left from your right
we the assassins laughin while the new worlds collapsin
mother earths ribs crashed in armored carways im blastin
as the earth rebels now womb swells
the birth of black magic savin my people force of habit
you cant find if you aint never had it
spiritually crafted blackness and hair-twisted ghetto embargo lifted
power-shiftin comb-fistin i predict goddesses you runnin after witches
i kiss my fourteen stitches


keep all my baby girl wishes
i predict all the oceans turn dry
not one baby girl will cry as you attempt to grow broccoli from the desert
we will take our pregnant bodies drink from underground rivers
wash your face between our legs
while recreating humanity we will summon yem and yaw
search for our fertility ban all pink and yellow pills
ban all pink and yellow pills
i predict killing fields of ghetto armpatch anti-hatch
hate groups will be bombed
childbirth becomes outlawed
always will be branded numbered and barred
all paper money is gone
though few scholars can interpret our scrolls
your sky has holes
we know the young is old
nastradamus tell us how the story gets told[nas]
to my niggaz huh

lets hold it down though yknow
however its gon go down
this what we gotta deal with yknow

its the life we chose where friends become foes
and the doughll get you killed quicker than you know
this is the life we chose bring fake snakes and hoes
and the only way out is death or goin broke
this the life we chose aint too many happy endings
thats why there aint too many happy niggaz in it
and ill admit it this life is fucked up but yo
but yo this life is the only life i know {*echoes}

[nas]
uhh uhh uhh
gold bathtubs makin love to my queen

my lifestyles like the forbes magazine
closets full of rockets and submachines
take this nigga out the projects and his thug team
yo we cruise past street lights ill rides
mr child both coasts with the most loud toast
calicos roast yall folks keep yall dyin
cause its hard to fuck around when we dealin with science
my enemies got money so yall should watch how i play it
they never know we enemies until they hear me say it
til they kids on the phone sayin please daddy pay it
til they brains on the floor mixed on the pavement
high-class elegance you respect or you hiss
you go against youd rather piss on an electrical fence
its strategic how these niggaz want you to think
youd be surprised whod be the one to put you to sleep
why you stink yo these streets dont allow you to blink
you get showered by lead comin out with your mink
bow ties and tuxedos bust eagles
dump drugs and acid then they rush with the rico
its hard fuckin with niggaz you hope you can trust
you a fool if your main bitch is easy to fuck
and youve got money - is these hoes greedy or what
shit is devious ex-friends wantin you stuck

chorus

[nas]
uhh whats love when you dont give your man enough dough
he wanna stick you
whats love you got beef
nobody rollin wit you
whats love you locked up and your family dont care
is love a four-letter word that deceives the air
whats real when you know your mans girl is a hoe
and you dont even let him know cause you fucked her befo
whats real when you talk behind a mans back
then you see him and give him dap now explain that
whats trust when they seperate your case
when you at your court date your co-de cant look in your face
whats trust when you keep your wife away from your man
and he never crossed you but you claimin hes fam
whats trust when you get bust your niggaz dont retaliate
they blaze purple haze with em the next day
god forbid one of my niggaz get hit ima go haywire
wont hesitate ima spray fire
but everybodys different you wont know how you react
til you in that position and thats an actual fact
the hearts of men change as time goes on whos wrong
you was hungry when you stuck duke he came back to buck you
whos wrong foul all your life now you 90
on your deathbed you regret bein grimy
whats lust a bust nut whats a thug
a ghetto child raised around drugs til hes old enough to bust slugs
then whats jail to rehabilitate or to make a nigga worse
when he come home to catch another case
lifes about decisions you choose it you gotta live it
you did it heaven or hell or prison
who knows when your clockll stop tickin get your weight up
save up before its over neighbor i told ya
you gettin older player look at those who gave up

chorus[nas]

the man of the house mom and pops seperatin
spittin image of a gangster the way pop walked
the way pop talked got older and you thanked him now
this is your hood poor folks drugs and robberies
turnin into the things moms wanted you not to be
crime followin the wrong dudes who have no values
lifes cheap as the dime in the minds of those around you
this is the test the stress the conflict the ups and downs of

they tell you keep it gangster no matter the predicament
even though your decision wont help you benefit

chorus

now once again this is you entertainin your desires
bitches money and guns aimin and you fire
everyday is grief if it aint beef its feedin your seed
tryin to eat you form material needs
the weed make your brain sizzle a pistol make it cool off
by stickin up niggaz make them take they jewels off
his reputation is bigger than his whole life span
he never planned to fail he just failed to plan
what does it take to realize satans alive he whispers
and any chance he get he can take niggaz
he comes in all shapes and sizes his best disguise is
when he stand beside us but god is inside us within me
you are your worst enemy - my moms words echo in my head
and if i let go im dead
he stepped at my door the  motivate my spirit
and now the body experience so now i feel it
lookin at my blessings the bullets - that missed me coulda hit me
them court cases coulda put me in the penitentiary
i never hate thats just wasted energy
the past is gone the presents a gift so whats the mystery
the future - and time only reveals what fear is
false expectations appearin real
we only human love thy neighbor so i was told
and i will til permanently my eyes are closed

chorusblack hoods cops n projects
sewers flooded with foul blockage
the gutters wild and every child watches
changin top locks with ripped off hinges
doors kicked off drunks stag off smirnoff wipe your beard off
crippled dope fiends in wheelchairs stare
vision blurry cus buried deep in they mind are hidden stories
bet hes a mirror image of that 70s era
finished for the rest of his life till he fades out
the liquor store workers miss him but then it plays out
so many ways out the hood but no signs say out
mental slavehouse where gats go off i show off
niggas up north prison-ology talk till they time cut off
you should chill if you short prepare deep thought
to hit the street again get it on get this paper and breathe again
plan to leave somethin behind
so your namell live on no matter what the game lives on

chorus
lookin out of my project window
oh i feel uninspired
lookin out of my project window
oh it makes me feel so tired

yo if this pianos the cake then my words are the candles
light it up make a wish and them angels will grant you
impatient once tried but in those angels and bamboo
they lit it up *puff* *puff* hit it up *puff*
now they dismantled think the whole world is crazy got a 9
watch where you walk 2 dollar fine sign of the times here in new york
hi satan united nations quietly taken to own your soul
take it or leave it just my evaluation
stack loot and guns teach the girls karate school your sons not to hate
but to stay awake cus the scars a razor make is nothin in comparison
to the gas left on this whole mass if we dont get it controlled fast
might as well be laughin with malcolm xs assassin as we die slow
perishin brain dead from a erickson
words are the medicine two teaspoons for goons
a cup of it for those thuggin it yall sing the tune

chorus

another day another dollar my mother will holla
she said go and see the world for myself and my brother shafala
pops was smooth from his top to his shoes
sang the rules guitar strings he played smokin his 
 hat picture this yo seventies cat
he wrote his music in the back of the crib i did my homework
at night the windows were speakers pumpin life out
a fight people screamin cus somebody pulled a knife out
so i look at this poem im hooked to this tune
every night the same melody hell sounded so heavenly
but jail was ahead of me 
readings what i shouldve done cus my imagination would run
i was impatient to get out and become part of the noise out there
i used to stare five stories down basketball courts shot up playgrounds
and i witnessed the murders and police shake-downs
yo the hustlas and hoes drugs and fo-fos
this was the life of every kid lookin out project windows

oh outta my window
lookin out of my project window
oh it makes me feel so tired
lookin out of my project window

i sent killers every race to put one in your spine

- and dinin you die then we laugh you bitch-ass

while im gettin head in a lear jet bathroom

those who know dont talk
and those who talk dont know a thing
men are born soft and turn tough
dead lay a stiffened heart ive been kissed by god
ive been hurt ive been marked for death almost ripped apart
by the beast but he missed his mark
alone in the dark my thoughts had sparked up
when i saw my body on the floor from above i watch it all
yo it came to me the pain in me
many slain empty skulls where a brain should be
it strangely seemed like it was a dream
but the si-rens had never woke me
only reason im here now is cause god chose me
and to me im only just a crook nigga
but god love us hood niggaz

chorus

[nas]
day by day by day i sit back and pray
my thugs get packed away in a maxi-cage
they pass away they went off the casket way
my gats will spray but that wont bring em back today
so long my crimies now gone for eternity
the team we got left on the set now turn to me
cant speak tears in my eyes revenge in my mind
i ride past the church where they got his body and find
they takin him to the hearse to put his body in dirt
thats it pay my respects wipe my tears with my shirt
now its time to do work out of love and retribution
as loyalty he would die for me no excuses
loadin clips up countin bullets carefully
for self though it feels like he was there for me
saw the enemy i ate him saw jakes behind me
they aint knock me its obvious that gods watchin me

chorus

[nas]
jealousy in the hood felonies in the hood
thugs wit guns become celebrities in the hood
yo its beef in the hood smoke trees in the hood
little girls have seeds by ogs in the hood
its food in the hood its drugs in the hood
you can choose if you would coke to sniff
dope to ooze in your blood parolees
ex-cons live in the hood its jobs in the hood
you can starve in the hood
your best friendsll fuck your baby moms in the hood
but its good in the hood
i was raised in the hood

my ghetto queen of sheba

[verse 1]

sipping red wine is it bedtime
you can kick it with your nigga while we listen to faith
im feeling richer today
i can hit it then stay
lingerie make me take it to the kitchen and play
we got champagne whipped cream ima grab a bucket of ice
bubble bath running and the candlelight feeling so right
its your night no stress no fight
mad at your ex cause his dough tight
never go right when youre with him
try your best to forget him
cause its easy to please me
cd skip when your head board hit the wall
call for the law
right when you cum im biting your tongue
make your legs cramp up you cant stand up
you can hit a blunt if you want
ima pull my pants up
we can discuss a weekend of lust on top of the trust
tell me whats the reason for us
to love or to fuck
im the thug that you want
if its gangster we cant front
if you want me i can stay around
if you need me im here for you
how that sound
now its up to you
depending on how you wanna get down
cause youre a big girl now

[chorus]

[verse 2]
got your name and your number in my cell phone
hear your voice and i wonder where you are if you all alone
if you in a good mood if you not
or you thinking bout you was at my spot
what we did when we got hot
is you dreaming you had me
is you creaming your panties
like a king fed me grapes and you fanned me
on the couch to the floor to the bed to the sink
and we ate each other like candy
under the covers two intimate lovers
you fuck a nigga like you mad at me
throw the ass to me
you should be glad to be
in the presence of a real thug as bad as me
while im in the streets with my murdering squad
you talking to your friends that im hurting it hard
how im making my rod how i make you say oh god
every hoe that you know wanna know nas
gotta dodge all the blowjobs getting hard
cause you know how these girls are
wearing tight shit no panties no bra
running up to my car with menage a trois suggestions
starting to get an erection
guessing only if you knew how your crew stressing
complexion chocolatey fondle me thinking its time to leave
i need time to breathe
wanna follow me ironically
you pop up throwing bottles at my tahoe
like its my fault
but you dont wanna talk
dont wanna hear nothing all of a sudden
you and the shorty start scuffing
now shorty dumping you out
cant let her get the best of you
so i rescue you
only thing left to do was to grab her
so you can jab her get a cheap shot
you dont wanna feel chumped
now here the cops come
so we gotta run to the ride
then we drive off through the traffic
dont panic but you know how we gotta manage
looking at your face
and the damage in your facial
every angle cant let it faze you
no reason to be insecure or immature
baby girl see the world is yours

[chorus fade out]uh its a new world its a new world 
its a new world its a new world
uh its a new world its a new world

yo celebrate the new life
new ways to make money
new ways to break dummies
forge they name and take money
computers aint that smart
whatever man built could be taken apart
anything new can get old
like dudes started rockin platinum some stopped wearin gold
solar-energized rides no steering wheel tell it how to drive
no propellers in the sky
airplanes like many rockets
waitin lists for the rich to get tickets to visit mars
while the poor people starve computers takin over they jobs
a mans forced to live off land
now its back to the caveman era
when we made fire by two sticks rubbin together
the truth is many are too scared of new data
america online cut off see you later

hook 2x
yo welcome to the new world new beginnin
a new way to play a new way a livin
cash is the past a new way a spendin
new life for man children and women

yo the new mike tysons roy jones
bill clintons the new jfk without the hole in his dome
the new don trump is bill gates
not because his occupation its cause we respect his cake
and cake mean his stock net gross
young kids step it up go for the most
new cameras in police cars takin pictures
new hustlas gettin new street figures
and us embassies overseas
almost every foreign countrys under seige
covertly startin wars cia navy seals
commit larcenies that be worth over mils
oil in the earth spills
girls blow they body up birth control pills
africans pick diamonds out a dark caves
then we wear it on our necks just so we can light up the stage

hook

say goodbye to the brainwashed
say goodbye to the young kids who not smart
say goodbye to the toasters and pop-tarts
yo its real
swallow a little pill theres a four-course meal
say hello to the one world
say hello to the sky somethins out there watchin you and i
more enticin than star trek startec phones
your genes and dna is used to make clones 
you got cd-rom everythang operates by computers
then what happens when circuit breaks
y2ks the big scare
scientists say we aint prepared
what i feel is contrare

but now we request for your e-mail address

but nothin make me more happier than seein today

oh oh oh[jessica care moore]
global warming between my legs screams against the waves
gave birth to thirteen daughters so now we never run out of water
my skin layered in diamonds and sage
left alone and confused forces enslaved by days
time keeps on whorin us
ghetto saviors cant keep ignorin us
flowers and flames flutes from her fingers
rifles pointed from her sac
or was it simply a bag of sticks and stones
either way she wore a compass on her head
rains dont stop the grass from turnin red
her hair was half perm half dread
we gave up walking in a past-life and so we dance
arms wrapped around my breath and choked me back to life
a new world wife reflecting the sun and rolling dice
symbol of the drama yet to come - too late to run
time travelling was late
watching was a blind mans mistake
all his assets melted right in front of his face
his right leg drabbed with demon paste
shoes stayed angel laced
never count your blessings with haste
even a prophet can catch a case
didnt realize how sweet the future might taste
telepathically cutting through mental gates
words were weapons against their hate
shepherds search for stars in her hair
her chest grew fermented like yeast
she broke her body like aged bread
he gave her truth from all the books hed read
she wrote her poems inside the mud
sacrificed her cervix to fix the future
named their boys and spit truth inside his mouth
read warm prophet writing twisted scriptures inside her belly
resurrected from bones and dirt
she made hard niggaz smile
left her seeds inside the earth
gave hustlers and killers lifes worth
this is the life we chose remember who was here first
find a reason why you curse
gold rushed tongues by dreams too loose
sporting electronic nooses
hoeing humanity love-ticks over lust
despite the damage to destiny you cant take the best of me
in god we still trustyo i still run wit that 
that blood of a slave boiling in my veins

that blood of a slave heart of a king

turn my voice up

ayo the brothas stillmatic
i crawled up outta my grave wipin the dirt
cleanin my shirt they thought id make another illmatic/
but its always foward im movin never backwards stupid/
heres another classic c-notes are fallin from the sky/
by now the credits rollin starrin nas executive poet/
produced-directed by the kid slash escobar/
narration descibes the lives of lost tribes in the ghetto tryin to suvive/
the feature opens wit this young black child/
fingers scratch cigarette burns in the sofa/
turnin the tv down while mary jane girls 45s playin/
soft in the backround food from c-town mornings was hashbrowns/
stepped over dope fiends walkin out the door
all of us poor/ i learned the difference between the snitches
the real ones and whos soft and the murderous/
hungriest crews people jumpin from roofs shotguns pumpin
made it through my youth/ walk a very thin line
ages seven to nine/ thats the age i was on my album cover/
this is the rebirth i know the streets thirst/
water like moses walkin through the hot desert
searchin to be free this is my ending and my new beginning
nostalgia alpha and omega places its like a glitch in the matrix/
i seen it all and did it all most of yall pop for a minute
spit a sentence then the game will get rid of yall
yall got there but yall aint get it all/
i want my style back hate to cease ya plan its the rap repo man/
to them double up hustlas
bitter niggas who real professionals stick up kids dreamin for mils/
let my words guide you get inside you
from crypts to pyros this is survival/

blood of a slave heart of a king      x4[gunshots]

your arms too short to box with god
i dont kill soloists only kill squads
fame went to they head so now its fuck nas
yesterday you begged for a deal today you tough guys

soon as i popped my first bottle i spotted my enemies tryna do what i do
came in with my style so i fathered you
i kept changin on the world since barbeque
now you wanna hang with niggas i hung with
fuck bitches i hit its funny i once said
if i ever make a record
i take a check and put something away for a rainy day to make my exit
but look at me now ten years deep
since in the project crack in my socks weep 
i never asked to be top of raps elite
just a ghetto child tryna learn the traps of the streets
but look at me now

chorus
youre the man youre the man
youre the man youre the man
youre the man youre the man
youre the man youre the man
youre the man youre the man

now wait a sec give me time to explain women and fast cars
and diamond rings can poison a rap star
its suicidal how i smoke in so much la
i saw a dead bird flyin through a broken sky
wish i could flap wings and fly away
to where black kings and ghana stay 
so i could get on my flesh right away
but thatll be the day when its peace
when my gat dont need to spray
when these streets are safe to play
sex with death indulge in these women
vision my own skeleton swimmin in eternal fire
broads play with pentagrams in they vagina
like the exorcist then they gave birth to my seeds
i beg for gods help why they love hurtin me
im your disciple a thug certainly
im the n the a to the s-i-r
if i wasnt i mustve been escobar
forty-five in my waist starin at my reflection
in the mirror sittin still in the chair like my conception
when everything around me got cloudy the chair became a kings throne
my destiny found me
its clear why the struggle was so painful
metamorphosis this is what i changed to
and god im so thankful

chorus to fadelisten up gangstas and honeys with ya hair done
pull up a chair hon and put it in the air son
dog whatever they call you god just listen
i spit a story backwards it starts at the ending

the bullet goes back in the gun
the bullet holes closin this chest of a nigga
now he back to square one
screamin shoot dont please
i put my fifth back on my hip
its like a vcr rewindin a hit
he put his hands back on his bitch
my caravan doors open up
i jumped back in the van and closed it shut
goin reverse slowly prepared
my nigga jungle utters out somethin crazy like go he there
sittin in back of this chair we hittin the roach
the smoke goes back in the blunt the blunt gets bigger in growth
jungle unrolls it put his weed back in the jar
the blunt turns back into a cigar
we listen to stevie it sounded like heavy metal fans
spinnin records backwards of ac/dc
i give my niggas dap jump out the van back first
back upstairs took off the black shirt
im in the crib with the phone to my ear
listen up so yall can figure out the poem real clear
the voice on the phone was like outside right we
so with my mouth wide holdin my heat
bullets i had plenty to squeeze plenty for ya
cause jungle said block your on enemies the
hung up the phone then the phone rang 
im laid in the bed thinkin bout this pretty young thing
who left she came back her clothes just fell to the rug
she fell to my bed and gave me a hug
i told her no hell
she talkin bout me kiss
bobbed her head then spit the nut back in my dick
started suckin with no hands a whole lotta spit
then got up and put her bra back on her tits
got fully dressed and told me stressed really im
picked up her gucci bag and left her nigga behind
walkin through the door she rang the bell twice
i vomited vodka back in my glass with juice and ice
the clock went back from three to two to one
and thats about the time the story begun
thats when i first heard the voicemail on the cell
it said son we found that nigga we gotta kill

[message beep]

for real a hustler purchased my range niggaz throwin dirt on my name
jealous cause fiends got they work and complain

[nas]
yo

was years back before nasir would explore a career in rap
as a music dude i mastered this rubiks cube
godzilla fought gargantua eyes glued to the tube
was a long time ago john boy ice
geronimo po-lice jumpin out chryslers easywider paper
pops puffin his sess punchin his chest like a gorilla
outside was psychoes killers
saw divine goon and chungo lil turkey
rip tyrone member no cursin front of ms vercey
big percy crazy paul the sledge sisters
my building was 40-16 once in the blue hallways was clean
i knew all that id seen had meant somethin
learned early to fear none little nas was huntin
livin carefree laughin got jokes on the daily
yall actin like some old folks yall dont hear me
yo im in my second childhood

[chorus repeat 2x]
cause when i flow the for the street -  who else could it be
n-a-s - nas
resurrect through the birth of my seed - queensbridge
make everything right - get yours nigga

[nas]
yo dude is 31 livin in his moms crib
ex-convict was paroled there after his long bid
cornrows in his hair still slingin got a crew
they break his moms furniture watchin comicview
got babies by different ladies high smokin ls
in the same spot he stood since eighty-five well
when his stash slow he be crazy
say he by his moms hit her on her payday
junior high school dropout teachers never cared
they was paid just to show up and leave no one succeeds
so he moves with his peers different blocks different years
sittin on different benches like its musical chairs
all his peoples moved on in life hes on the corners at night
with young dudes its them he wanna be like
its sad but its fun to him right he never grew up
31 and cant give his youth up hes in his second childhood

[chorus]

[nas]
baby girl shes always talkin name droppin hangin late
drinkin smokin hates her baby daddy craves shoppin
e poppin ecstasy takin wont finish her education
best friend she keeps changin stuck with limitations
lustin men many hotels fendi chanel
with nothin in her bank account frontin she do well
her kid suffers he dont get that love he deserve
he the sun she the earth single mom even worse
no job never stay workin mad purty
shorty they call her the brain surgeon
time flyin she the same person never matures
all her friends married doin well
shes in the streets yakkety yakkin like she was 12
honey is twenty-seven argues fights
selfish in her own right for life  guess shes in her second childhood

[chorus]

who else could it be - n-a-s - nasthis is a journey into the worlds most largest and notorious projects queensbridge listen while nas saves his hood from the most cowardest rappers

[nas]
he held a mass appeal and a little boy smile
depressed has a complex his mouth was foul
you need to stay around i feel like telling some stories
first theres this arrogant fuck his names cory
hung around my mans like and big trevor
trevors still locked up likes getting his cheddar
cory changed his name to arr whatever
corn chip buckwheat look alive its mega
right mega was his name sorry about that
but its so hard to put a cowards name in my rap
always acting tough a jokester be fronting
he got snuffed he got shot in the thigh he did nothing
but thats nas always looking out for brethren
cause when brethren dont return love it dont stress him
cause gangstas do gangsta shit real recognize real
still laughing to the bank and shit
back to cor got him a deal but his rhymes was whack
def jam mad that he signed the contract
now he got jealous and mad at my shine
making silly tapes im always on his mind
nonsense not to be obnoxious kid
mega for the record you can suck my dick
bitch you from around the way; its sad what this do to me
but queensbridge we gotta have unity

[chorus x2]
so they say the bridge is over the bridge is over
nah this is a time we destroy and rebuild it
they say the bridge is over the bridge is over
nah we the strongest hood but weak niggas kill it

[nas]
since we on the subject of traitors and flunkies
mega aint the only faggot in my hood dummies
theres plenty that wanna be me but cannot
its like king arthur and knight sir lancelot
lefty and donnie brasco gotti and paul
before i woulda told you prodigys my dog
through the ups and downs robberies and all
though i always knew he wanted my downfall
he would say his little slick shit and act real funny
for what nigga youre button aint gotten back to me
asking a braveheart to get back your jewelry
you aint from my hood dont even rep qb
nature moved to marcy
man dick riding nature nothing else to say
man nature moved to marcy
backward ass niggas 
man fuck them niggas go head with the progam man proceed
old lady pocketbook snatcher car thief
of course we aint friends you never stood on no blocks
streets or corners with zombies ghouls and gangstas
cops drug dealers with pools of blood; anger 
just fills me when niggas let out of town to set shot
and get filthy rich its just not
no more morals no loyalty no more community
queensbridge we gotta have unity

[chorus]

[nas]
i put the name on the map after marly and shan
qb before the roc had one jam
before the death row and bad boy beef
had streets locked with raw talent i laugh at the weak
so this about cleaning up house my own backyard
famous home of rap stars well known be getting robbed
p how many times aint you shamed that
jungle was busting his gun to get your weak chain back
they dont respect you; a checks due for me for your fame
mega i hope you blow so im saying your name mega mega

yo yo life they wonder 
can they take me under nah never that
yo yo i come from the housing tenement buildings
unlimited killings menaces marked for death
better known as the projects where junkies and rock heads dwell
though i owe to it my success
well survival of the fittest every day as a child
i would think im a part of usa and be proud
confronted with racism started to feel foreign
like the darker you are the realer your problems
i reached for the stars but i just kept slipping
on this life mission never know whats next
aint your king from fiji welcome julius caesar
had a piece of the globe every continent
there was asia africa europe france japan
pakistan america afghanistan
yo there was protestants jews blacks arabics
call a truce world peace stop acting like savages
no war we should take time and think
the bombs and tanks makes mankind extinct
cut since the beginning of time its been man with arms fighting
lost lives in the towers and pentagons
why then must it on we must stop the killing
tell me why we die we all gods children

all this hate cant last forever
its time that we stand together
everybody wants to rule the world

come on world world world
peace world world world
peace world world world
peace world world world

all those brothers on the block posted up like they own it
thats daytona from new york to california
got blocks locked down
like dog you safe whenever you with me
see this is my town
so the youngstas pros and ghettos goes to prison
at a early age already know its against them
so in order for him to survive one day
he must open up his eyes to the set backs
cause everybody wants a shot in this land of opportunity
look at what this countrys got
there shouldnt be nobody homeless
how can the president fix all the problems when he aint fixed home yet
the earth wasnt made for one man to rule alone
to all colors and creeds is to whom it belongs
i want land mansions banks and gold
the diamonds in africa oil in my control
the worlds natural resources own its residuals
but then comes foes i have to guard it with missiles
and i become the most wanted
but is it worth hearing a million people problems and followed by secret service
i guess attempts at my life are loaded barrels
so move over colin powell just throw in a towel yo

all this hate cant last forever
its time that we stand together
everybody wants to rule the world

come on world world world
peace world world world
peace world world world
peace world world world

yall know thats my style and hit you at the right time
no other compares to what nas write down
tell you my dreams show you my pain is yours
you could get what you love be a chain to cause
you alive right now
theres so many that dead or locked up inside the beast
ima holler it now
its whatever man thinkll manifest to be real
the plan is to wake up cause time reveals
all this hate cant forever last
all my ghetto heroes in heaven its like you right here and never passed
you just transcend i know im gonna see you again
hoping ill reach the world leaders and win
aint nothing without struggle listen up its critical
we used to fear arms now the weapons are chemical
in hip hop the weapons are lyrical
to be the best you challenge the best and the blessing is spiritual
top of the world for the kid none less
popping any rappers head off his shoulders no contest
i know the most high hear me so far you cant hear me
you scared of a mirror
my theory is that knowledge is power
to every projects and every street corner
we gotta get out of this now

all this hating lasts forever
its time that we stand together
everybody wants to rule the worldamerican born american raised american made

[chorus 2x]
my country shitted on me my country
she wants to get rid of me naw never
cause the things i seen we know too much
cause the things i seen we seen too much

[verse 1 nas]
it was packed on the rykers bus
the tight cuffs is holdin me shackled
the life of a thug caught in the devils lasso
on the streets i was invincible
cowards would duck at a glimpse if they knew
what my pistol would do a fuckin killa
mothers of dope fiend embarrassin me
all in front of my friends
in the street smile with no teeth
i never knew daddy heard he had a 72 caddy
died in a robbery cant remember him was probably 3
why didnt my folks just die in this society
why wasnt i a child of a doctor who left stocks for me
two little brothers two sisters them shortiez gots to eat
mothers a junkie she twisted so all they got is me
im the provider with goals to do much better than my father
whether through drugs sold or holdin revolvers
blurry visions of dad holdin me high
it comes to me slowly the words he would cry

[repeat chorus]

[verse 2 millenium thug]

shootem in the back for the get back
lead through shit bag hold tie gag
forget the life had now we all rebels

and debris from the earth as we knew crumble

physicians prescripting us medicine which is poison
doctors injecting our infants with the poison
religion misoverstood is poison

verse 1
niggas up in my hood be getting shot giving poison
in hospitals shots rittle the block
little children and elderly women run for their lives
drizzling rain come out the sky every time somebody dies 
must be out my fucking mind what is this the hundreth time
sending flowers to funerals reading rest in peace
you know the usual death comes in threes
life is short is what some nigga said
not if you measure life by how one lives and what he did
its funny how these black killer companies is making money off us
fast food cola sodas skull and bone crossers

chorus

verse 2
sisters up in my hood trying to do good given choices
when pregnant drop out of school or have abortions
stop working hoping that they find a man that will support them
up late night on they mothers cordless thinking a perm or
bleaching cream will make better when they gorgeous
white girls tanning lypo suction
fake titties are implanted fake lips thats life destruction
lightskin women bi-racial hateful toward themselves
denying even they blood
i dont judge tiger woods but i overstand the mental poison
thats even worser than drugs

verse 4

verse 5

this is the problem cause he never tell em he got it
from letting fags suck him off rikers island in nine-three
drives in benz hangs in all the parties
all the concerts backstage where the stars be
rocking their shirts in bitches faces like clockwork
whats your name where you from chain blinging
thinking girls everywheres dumb taking pride in ruining their lives
so they could never have babies and they could never be wives
he never used a condom give him head he got ya
met the wrong bitch and now he dead from the monster aids
i contemplate believing in karma
those on top could just break and wont be eating tomorrow
i know some bitches who be sleeping on niggas dreams
they leave when they nigga blow she the first bitch on her knees
knowing dudes thats neglecting their seeds
instead of taking care of em they spending money on trees
i pray for you deadbeat daddies
cause when them kids get grown its too late for you

hookuhh yeah uhh

[verse 1 nas]
blessings in life to the children
they say life is like 5 days
words of a old man with silver hair in his wheel chair
his eyes were bloody while describin what lies before me
said evil bitches and jealous men would try to destroy me
it occurred to me this old niggas words couldnt be realer
im on top now slightest drama ill have ta kill ya
cuz animals and sweetness sharks smell blood in water
ishmael moses and job moved a divine order
shit is plastic material havin no life
i crash whips and leave it no matter the price
as long as i survive coppin the five
circle the block where the beefs at
and park in front of my enemys eyes
they see that its war we life stealers
hollow tip lead busters theres no heaven or hell
dead is dead fuckers
and your soul is with god
your mind keeps lurkin to earth
watchin your own murder reoccur

[chorus repeat 2x]
for ever struggle every strip and every ghetto
for every nigga toned in the pain and heavy metal

and for every brotha breathin
live to see another mornin

[verse 2 blitz]
its blitz nigga the streets glory many die for me
got knocked refused 3 to 9s went to trial for me
basically im just reality loaded with vast stories
of lust greed and contempt no street is exempt
extended clip shots hoods barricaded for 6 blocks
i sip shots watchin em hustlers pitch rocks
all you paintin pictures of my pain
illustrate the city in vain
fallin deep into the pits of the game
this is for the sickest state of mind
in these fatal times vesh crimes
nickel play the nine and niggas for the dime
hear the sounds of them babys cry
still im sayin why do we reside
in the ghetto with a million ways to die
stayin high to relieve the pain
breathin in the game exhalin
guilts and the shame misery and strain
what the fuck will tomorrow bring
look at anthrax i stand back through
hopin i make it tomorrow

[verse 3 nas]
my skin is a art gallery right
with paintings of crucifixes
hopin to save me from all the dangers in the music business
was once a young gangsta hangin with youth offenders
but since i tasted paper it started losin the friendships
watchin kids freeze in winters they still poor
how could i tease them with benzs and feel no remorse
drivin past them in the lively fashion diamond colors clashin
red stones blue stones red bones and black ones
fuck did i expect with bucket seats in a lex
and spendin time in chuckie cheese with little des
got guns when im with my daughter
hate to bring a violent aura in her presence
she knows what daddy taught her its lessons
black princess its a ugly world
i put my life up for yours see i love that girl
could you believe even my shadows jealous
my skin is mad at my flesh my flesh hates my own bones
my brain hates my heart my heart makes the songs
though my songs come from the father
im lonely
hold me its gettin darker

[repeat chorus 2x]feat az

[verse one az the visualiza]
visualizin the realism of life and actuality
fuck whos the baddest a persons status depends on salary
and my mentality is money orientated
im destined to live the dream for all my peeps who never made it
cause yeah we were beginners in the hood as five percenters
but somethin must of got in us cause all of us turned to sinners
now some restin in peace and some are sittin in san quentin
others such as myself are tryin to carry on tradition
keepin the schwepervesence street ghetto essence inside us
cause it provides us with the proper insight to guide us
even though we know somehow we all gotta go
but as long as we leavin thievin well be leavin with some kind of dough
so and to that day we expire and turn to vapors
me and my capers-ll be somewhere stackin plenty papers
keepin it real packin steel gettin high
cause lifes a bitch and then you die

[chorus az the visualiza]
lifes a bitch and then you die; thats why we get high
cause you never know when youre gonna go go
lifes a bitch and then you die; thats why we puff lye
cause you never know when youre gonna go go
lifes a bitch and then you die; thats why we get high
cause you never know when youre gonna go go
lifes a bitch and then you die; thats why we puff lye

times is illmatic 4x
destined to live the dream for all my peeps who never made it 1x

[verse two nas]
i woke up early on my born day im twenty years of blessing
the essence of adolescent leaves my body now im fresh in
my physical frame is celebrated cause i made it
one quarter through life some god-ly like thing created
got rhymes 365 days annual plus some
load up the mic and bust one cuss while i puffs from
my skull cause its pain in my brain vein money maintain
dont go against the grain simple and plain
when i was young at this i used to do my thing hard
robbin foreigners take they wallets they jewels and rip they green cards
dipped to the projects flashin my quick cash
and got my first piece of ass smokin blunts with hash
now i think about cash in abundance niggaz i used to run with
is rich or doin years in the hundreds
i switched my motto -- instead of sayin fuck tomorrow
that buck that bought a bottle couldve struck the lotto
once i stood on the block loose cracks produce stacks
i cooked up and cut small pieces to get my loot back
times is illmatic keep static like wool fabric
pack a four-matic that crack your whole cabbage

[chorus]

yeah you know the flavor

when the cops came you shoulda slid to my crib 
fuck it black no time for looking back its done 
plus congratulations you know you got a son 
i heard he looks like you why dont your lady write you 
told her she should visit thats when she got hyper 
flippin talkin about he acts too rough 
ge didnt listen he be riffing while im telling him stuff 
i was like yeah shorty dont care she a snake too 
fucking with them niggaz from that fake crew that hate you 
but yo guess who got shot in the dome-piece 
jeromes niece on her way home from jones beach its bugged 
plus little rob is selling drugs on the dime 
hanging out with young thugs that all carry 9s 
at night time its more trife than ever 
whattup with cormega did you see em are yall together 
if so then hold the fort down represent to the fullest 
say whassup to herb ice and bullet 
i left a half a hundred in your commissary 
you was my nigga when push came to shove 
one what one love 

verse two 

dear born youll be out soon stay strong 
out in new york the same shit is going on 
the crack-heads stalking loud-mouths is talking 
hold check out the story yesterday when i was walking 
the nigga you shot last year tried to appear like he hurting something 
word to mother i heard him fronting 
and he be pumping on your block your man gave him your glock 
and now they run together what up son whatever 
since im on the streets ima put it to a cease 
but i heard you blew a nigga with an ox for the phone piece 
wiling on the island but now with el mara 
better chill cos them niggaz will put that ass on fire 
last time you wrote you said they tried you in the showers 
but maintain when you come home the corners ours 
on the reals all these crab niggaz know the deal 
when we start the revolution all they probably do is squeal 
but chill see you on the next vi 
i gave your mom dukes loot for kicks plus sent your flicks 
your brothers buck wiling in four maine he wrote me 
he might beat his case til he come home i play it low key 
so stay civilized time flies though incarcerated your mind dies
i hate it when your moms cries 
it kinda wants to make me murder for real-a 
ive even got a mask and gloves to bust slugs but one love

verse three 

sometimes i sit back with a buddha sack 
minds in another world thinking how can we exist through the facts 
written in school text books bibles etcetera 
fuck a school lecture the lies get me vexed-er 
so i be ghost from my projects 
i take my pen and pad for the weekend hitting ls while im sleeping 
a two day stay you may say i needed time alone 
to relax my dome no phone left the 9 at home 
you see the streets have me stressed something terrible 
fucking with the corners have a nigga up in belle vue 
or hdm hit with numbers from 8 to 10 
a future in a maximum state pen is grim 
so i comes back home nobodys out but shorty doo-wop
rolling two phillies together in the bridge we call them oowops 
he said nas niggaz could be busting off the roof 
so i wear a bullet proof and pack a black tres-deuce 
he inhaled so deep shut his eyes like he was sleep 
started coughing when i peeked to watch me speak 
i sat back like the mack my army suit was black 
we was chilling on these benches where he pumped his loose cracks 
i took the l when he passed it this little bastard 
keeps me blasted and started talking mad shit 
i had to school him told him dont let niggaz fool him 
cause when the pistol blows the one thats murdered be the cool one
tough luck when niggaz are struck families fucked up 
couldve caught your man but didnt look when you bucked up 
mistakes happen so take heed never bust up 
at the crowd catch him solo make the right man bleed 
shortys laugh was cold blooded as he spoke so foul 
only twelve trying to tell me that he liked my style 
then i rose wiping the blunts ash from my clothes 
then froze only the blow the herb smoke through my nose 
and told my little man that im a go cyprose 
left some jewels in the skull that he can sell if he chose 
words of wisdom from nas try to rise up above 
keep an eye out for jake shorty im out one lovethe buddha monks in your trunk turn the bass up
nas stories by aesop place your loot up parties i shoot up
nas i analyze drop a jew-el
inhale from the l school a fool well you feel it like braille
it aint hard to tell i kick the skill like shaquille holds a pill
vocabulary spills im ill
plus matic i freak beats slam it like iron shiek
jam like a tech with correct techniques
so analyze me surprise me but cant magmatize me
scannin while youre plannin ways to sabatoge me
i leave em froze like her-on in your nose
nasll rock well it aint hard to tell

verse ii needed

it aint hard to tell i excel then prevail
the mic is contacted i attract clientele
my mic check is life or death breathin a snipers death
i exhale the yellow smoke of buddha through righteous steps
deep like the shinin sparkle like a diamond
sneak a uzi on the island in my army jacket linin
hit the earth like a comet invasion
nas is like the afrocentric asian half-man half-amazin
cause in my physical i can express throuh song
delete stress like motrin then extend strong
i drank moet with medusa give her shotguns in hell
from the spliff that i lift and inhale it aint hard to tellfeat r kelly

[nas]
low profile rap style slick as nu nile
give the crew pounds everytime we cover new grounds
still surviving but theres a few down back in the essence
im asking questions on the phone with jail adolescents
quiet confession the systems applying the pressure
my mind is guessing is living and dying a lesson
but not to be obliged with the mirage
of cars taking you off track 
from with the gods focus on hard
laid up smoking cigars
motioning maids to bring me toast and eggs
kosher ice chokers and wolves to smoke ya
my wisdom culture lives in ultra madness
devoted coach bag bitch
broke the average niggas hopes to get mad rich
but whats the purpose
only the gods can watch the earth twist
im physically trapped down on the surface
with all the crack merchants
snakes and serpents
foul jakes the searches
clowns with four pounds this aint a circus

[chorus r kelly]
street dreamer
oh mercy mercy me
aint nothing i got for ya
situations gettin heavy
heavy heavy
trying to be a gangster

[nas]
the black clouds over the hood im on the corner with the thugs 
late night under the moon as they assume im slanging drugs
cause im hooded up thought a g a night wasnt good enough
pushed my luck yo they had a brother put in cuffs
luckily made it out of court comfortably
judge said i need a job aint nothing coming free
couldve got a one to three
i try to school these shorties under me
but they cant see 
from life to death
so know we back to where we never left the ghetto
its a damn shame knowing its a mans game
shorty thinks its time to make ya plans change
all that running round trying to chase 
whats already here - been there its going nowhere
pops told me knuckle up - no fear
i wish some of these killings
they could be prevented
whatever happens it was written
meaning god meant it
but during ya life you put ya heart in it
even though it seems we being targeted
let that brother r hit it

[chorus] extended

[nas]
sort of wild since a child hope was all we had
drip the bust out past
complaning the mental straining
how many in my crew is into gaining
subtract the weak links about the chaining
rise it start raining
blasphemy using nas name in vain
some claim supreme being yet they lied in his name
i tried to learn the game
and the only thing i found incredible
everything i tried to learn see i already knew thats right
and its embedded in my heart now 
so i can sit back count a stack
and play my part now
i saw my life flash in front of my eyes he wore disguise
put a gun to me hungry he went on to chastize
thats nas aint it made it rich from entertainment
fresh wallys painted as he told the kid he came with
my first thought was how the game flip
yo perhaps it was somebody i smacked drunk in a party on yak
or was i marked for a contract for some foul act
i did a while back or beyond that
you got me laying face flat
saying my grace black woke up in a cold sweat
yo i hate that
nightmares feeling real word to will
my a-alike i lost in the battlefield
thats why i hit the mic with mad appeal
grab ya shield and meet ya maker
queens niggaz die for paper
these the things the street dreams will take ya

wat moet je zonder liefde beginnen mis geliefden beminnend 
in t diepste van binnen met om in liefde voor zinnen
vertaal mn tranen in t leven in lyrics zwevend woorden banen zich
snel wegen in de geest met lanen en stegen 
binnenin huilt mn hart zn weg naar mn vingers kan t niet echter verzinnen 
hand om mn pen en mn text kan beginnen
sirene wenend zwaar naar mn brain
van jarenlang een vreemde eend tot een maand op nummer n 
flashbacks van mn jongenskamer jaren alleen
de dood van geliefden viel met tranen ineen
je breekt daar wat wou je nou als je verder gaat 
en denkt na hou jij van jou als je nergens staat 
weg met leeg gepraat ga niet voor geld of de pegels
ben me bewust van deze verses dus benut elke regel 
je hoort de brain omdat je t pure wou
voor iedereen van nederland tot kaapverdi aruba bonaire curaao
suriname turkije beaam t blije van marokko tot vlaanderen
afrika tot aziatische wijken zuid-amerika europa usa wereldwijd

27 hit your crew 6 went into you
everybody gotta die sometime
hope your funeral never get cought up
pain s going through the innocent
nothing is fair brothers roll up
shooting from wheel chairs my heart is racing
tasting revenge in the air
i let this shit slide for too many years
too many times now im strapped with a couple of macz
too many 9z if ya people really with me
get busy load up the semiz
do more then just hold it explode the clip until you empty
theres nothing in our way
they bust - we bust they rust - we rust
left right feel it i feel it in my gut
that we take these dudes to war
lie them down cause we stronger now

alleen op hoeken van straten lees je boeken luister je platen
hoor politici weer oeverloos praten 
voel je verlaten en moet dan wel wraken
t goede verlatend plaatsmakend voor woede door haten en voel je gelaten 
wie gooit er roet in zaken 
wie blijft al vloekende praten
wie heeft t goed en wie flatert 
wie is bedroefd en wie schatert 
wie hoest er - wie gaapt er 
wie proest er - wie slaapt er
wie doet alsof is namaak 
wie ploetert - wie hapert 
zoveel vragen in een wereld banger en enger
en ben met verlangen verstrengeld op de klank van merengue
voor speciale personen voel ik diepe liefde die prachtig is 
mc ik niet voor niets en verdiep me dan in de alchemist 
fuck n diss pas als ik rock op shit die pakkend is 
veel te lang ingeslikt tot mn ziel naar adem snakkend is
alleen vrede in mn geest op stage met die ene mic 
wreed en hype - tekeergaand als een vreselijk beest 
schreeuwetuit verschil moet er zijn de tyfus voor non-believers
laat je nix wijsmaken peeps en ga voor wat je lief is
je hoeft niet te doen alsof - die shit is jezelf 
zoek maar waar je maar wil echt waar maar t zit in jezelf

they dont understand or wanna see me on top
too egotistical talking all that slick stuff
while my name is biblicall
wonder whats my secrets is
enemies move on you only if they know what your weakness is
i have none too late to grab guns im lafhing 
cause ima cool brotha thought i wouldnt have that ass done
fooled you brothas what you call a infinite brawl
eternal souls clashing war gets deep
some beef this everlasting complete with thick scars
brothers knifing each other up in prison yards
drama where does it start
you know the block was ill as a youngster
every night it was like a cop will be killed
bodies found in the dumpster
for real a hustler purchase my range
people throwing dirt at my name
jealous cause fenes got their work and complain
wemen left me cause they thought i was finished
shouldve knew she wasnt true
she came to me when her man caught us sin in
i was so blinded i will never make the same mistakes
moving with the change of pace
light a low see now the king is straight
swelling my melon cause none of these brothas were hurting
telling the police how could the kingpins squeal
this is crazy im on the right track
im finally found you need some soul searching
the time is now

[nas]

pushin drop-tops stacy lattisaw tapes the 80s had us all apes
youngest gorillas up to bat at home plate
that was a uncanny era guns in my pants
yeah x-clan hair with dreads at the top of my fade
homicide and feds on the blocks where i played b-ball
thats when i wondered was i here for the cause or be-cause
cause ray charles could see the ghetto
was told to stay strong and i could beat the devil
cause yo i used to play apollo balcony seats
watchin niggaz swing razors in the front row then out in the streets
the car show 560s chemical afros
acuras pumpin super lover cee and casanova

so where them years go  where the old gold beers and cheers go
but now them shorties here doe so

the doo rags are back fitted hats snorkels and furs

the drinkers stay drinkin or puffin they herb
and im still enjoyin lifes ride; one mo time

rikers island bustin still packed whats the word
the drinkers stay drinkin or puffin they herb

political thugs in shark suits persuade us to pull triggers
in army boots yellin join the armed forces
we lost the vietnam war intoxicated poisons
needles in arms of veterans instead of bigger fortunes
theres still a lot of naked crawlin in the carpet offices
war in the ghetto we crabs in a barrel they torture us
they wont be servin the beast too long
the murderers wearin police uniforms confederate flags i burn
beat street breakers were dancin to the music i chose
and peachtree atlantic crackheads was tootin they nose
in frozen corners of chicago loaded up llamas children
with fo-fos and double-revolvers
we devil incarnates headed for jail
where shell gas company in south africa be havin us killed
your paper money was the death of christ
and all these shorties comin up just resurrect your life
its like a cycle

the doo rags are back fitted hats snorkels and furs
rikers island bustin still packed whats the word
the drinkers stay drinkin or puffin they herb

niggaz used to wear rags on they hair when it was fried up
thats when we were lied to buyin hair products
back before my generation when our blackness started disintegratin
til awareness started penetratin
the styles come from prison they used potatoes makin liquor
just to prove we some creative niggaz
turnin nothin into somethin is god work
and you get nothin without struggle and hard work
war is necessary to my niggaz in chains
from greene to sing-sing im wantin yall to know one thing
the hardest thing is to forgive but god does
even if you murdered or robbed yeah its wrong but god loves
take one step toward him he takes two toward you
even when all else fail god support you
i done it got god sun on my stomach
my heart and my lungs was affected from hennys and gettin blunted

i wanna be iced-up nigga bury me the same
i live for street glory and i die for ghetto fame
respect all fear none my pride is everything
initials in swimming pools floors women lose draws
a true boss never lose wars got cheddar to floss
guns under beds mask and a flashlight
living my life like everydays my last night
alcoholic on toilets i shit blood
foreign cars models and stars life of a rich thug
mama told me from weed i would switch drugs
to cocaine and hit clubs and deep-dish dubs
how would she know unless she hit the clubs got her mack-on
back in the 60s with an afro and her platforms
bopping to the supremes smoking joints
thats cool but ima live how i want

[chorus 1]
i did it my way from crumbs and roaches and rats
i did it my way converted in from hustling to raps
i did it my way from break dancing back spins on the cardboard
i did it my way to bullet proof bentleys gats in the cars door
i did it my way never gave a fuck what nobody said
i did it my way they hope that i fail and wished i was dead
i did it my way if i fucked op it falls on me
i did it my way im lucked up and struck rich now we all can eat

gateways marble floors chandeliers
juzzis gucci soap throwing cash in the air
though i still feel broke with millions in the bank
and deals on the table i focus to stay afloat
and just to think some would die to get with i got
they think its alot the blink of an eye you could get shot
niggas is wolves coming if you ruthless or not
but i be on point put you in places where bodies rot
never knew murder till i seen my man get popped
no blood soaking laying there eyes still open
i got a little closer put my hand in his palm
he was looking right through me yo staring beyond
i wonder what he saw the limoes movies and tours
did he die in vain and represent for the cause
now i put his name on everything im involved
and thats the game yall cant relate fuck yall ill will

[chorus 2]
i did it my way from crumbs roaches and rats
i did it my way converted in from hustling to raps
i did it my way i call it how i see it niggas

suckers do what they cant

yo hoes in my fold can slow me roll with the brokest homies
cold and we hopeless lonelies scolding my foes who phony
from blocks where coke can feed you and cops are over evil
they know some people who tell on felons who sold some diesil
here on and blow it rurals its mine knew a crew one time
89 they took work to caroline and blew big time
in just two years their crew disappear
snitches and bitches smeared the paint on their pictures
years back i reminiscence and remember sitting on wood benches
gave me splinters just a baby nigga thankful
when them killers came through guns out moving
i think the ones who said shorty go home we about to be shooting

[chorus 1]real conversation for that ass
its what they want huh
its what they want what you said cant hear you man
its what they want speak the fuck up
its what they want word its what they want

[nas]
nastradumas astrologic know when i rep
flow when im set got the chips to a lotus my whip
gold on my neck was once a code of respect
for high rollers and vets
now its loads of baguettes prefer a mack-10 over a tech
no matter sober or wet i smack soldiers cadets
trees that might eject my hype back
famous phrase nigga light that
hoes you fuck ask you where your ice at dun
its all about playboys when we was young
can only get tongue then finally we can cum
busting in hoes guzzling 4s
crack blitz 86 you turn hustling pro
from bottles to seven in your hand
to fake pepsis to get to the crack unscrew the can
gleam blunted seeing 100s stacks of boy with a lean on it
we got it if the fiends want it
the whole block singing the same theme don it
fuck it too many crabs in the bucket
if its ice work im gonna truck it
you gotta love it you gotta love it

[chorus]
its what they want fuck it
its what they want you gotta love it
its what they want fuck it
its what they want you gotta love it
its what they want fuck it

some girls get too emotional fanatic extremist
get pulsive with malice insentitives the foulest of bitches
hung up my riches her childest wishes
be suspicious of those sleeping with fishes them hoes
conspicuous and it shows tricking this dough
kicking this flow slip in a new fo
so when your click roll i let my clips go niggas on opposite polls
i got that confident soul for those locked in a hole
inhuman living hostile opposed
to living on the streets proper from my top to my toes
aeropostale my clothes vernon niggas in suburbans with liquor
preposterous foes frantically foul niggas
see niggas in blast there goes a loud difference
coke sniffing tapping 13 year old chickens
you cant be a kingpin when you snitching
regardless we still make you a target
we shoot you and chill chrome objects
hit you in your projects its street anomics
this rhyme is edited credited through ebonics
miserable cats hunger painting
get off your ass stop complaining
my crew be in montego bay margariting 
while you home waiting your arraignment
this thug life you claimed it i make millions from entertainment 
now back in the hood certain cats they wanna kill me
they ice grill me but on the low niggas feel me
you gotta love it you gotta love it

[chorus]
its what they want fuck it
its what they want you gotta love it
its what they want fuck it
its what they want you gotta love it
its what they want its what they want its what they wanta lot of times it seems like you aint gon make it where you wanna be in life
but yo if you got a plan believe me you gon get there
you gon get everything you ever wanted baby
thats my word

trust my niggas come home from long bids
they check for me before they see their own kids
i open up accounts for em we bounce tour in
major cities arenas headline with big time singers
cop ferraris with navigational screens
guide us through your hood and any locality head back to queens
piped out seats oakwood mb cord speakers
bumpin out old shit
that made me think of old easters 86 in a le tigre short sleeves
lees flip the cuffs up gettin fucked up
from old e fresh fest niggas got hurt
100 niggas rush the door with queensbridge tournament shirts
back then nobody wore a vest
pull out razors you had to put your hand skills to the test
get your pumas took come home barefoot willin
look at the chain i snatched with a medallion worth a thousand
cops rushed the garden made it home smilin
half of the crew probably on the island
project call play puff ball the hoop was made out of a hanger
playin corners stick the elevator never thought
project life was promised nothin but to die trife
for steppin on the next mans nikes my motto look for tomorrow
today is yesterday look at the hood now im mad that it turned out that way
gats spray these shorties is killers
the older gs taught us well whats wild now is that theyre smaller
and they look at me like im on the outside lookin in
like whos you when i cruise through
i call shorty took him in watch your friends get ends
be clever realize that todays the first day that begins forever

everything will eventually come to an end
so try to savor the moment cuz time flies dont it
the beauty of life you gotta make it last for the better
cuz nothin lasts forever

everything will eventually come to an end
so try to savor the moment cuz time flies dont it
the beauty of life you gotta make it last for the better
cuz nothin lasts forever

nice cars livin like a star club hoppin
poppin bottles at the bar love shoppin
gucci iceberg coppin two three nice furs
one for your wife one for your freak silver spurs
rolls royce too good to be true houses worth 22
pool parties beautiful view
you made it in life forbes magazine style baggy jeans style
pass the green while hoes wit meanwhile
asses pretty mommies illest bodies pass glasses
louis roderra with peach schnapps you just relaxin
thinkin damn wish my niggas could afford this
on the sand at your malibu house holdin a cordless
talkin to lawyers accountants investments
money doubles triples protected hard work you manifested
worries of failure when you buried will your familia
keep your name prosperin to the maximum
you should live theres only one life thats the physical
rich or poor in jail why the fuck should you be miserable
things happen for reasons the clock keeps tickin
love could have your heart beat skippin thugs turn to religion
the bitch you love could start to hate you the shit you use to do escape you
things that make you laugh represent the past
reminisce the block gamble gees on the floor
niggas use to be the man you dont see em no more
your favorite restaurants and favorite stores they tore em down
turn em into shopping malls the hood is like a ghost town
haunted by souls who thought that time stood still
just live your life to the fullest never look back its real

everything must eventually come to an end
so try to savor your moments cuz time flies dont it
the beauty of life you gotta make it last for the better
cuz nothin lasts forever ya know

i said everything eventually comes to an end
so try to savor your moments cuz time flies dont it
the beauty of life you gotta make it last for the better
cuz nothin lasts forever
ya know ya now nothin lasts forever ya knowuhh uhh

what you base your happiness around material women and large paper
that means you inferior not major

[nas]
if niggaz could look inside my mind youll find
where bodies are buried first look past the hotties who dimes
go to the center enter with caution past the braincell graveyard
where weeds responsible for memory loss
lets witness the horrific the stenchll make you nauseous
see what i seen every day i live with this torture
lightin spliffs up to stay high like 24 hours
sleep with my heat wash with my gun in the shower
my tongue is power it thrills women kills demons
long as im still breathin im still winnin ill teach em
the hood converted from trey bags to 20s a girl
everybody had money every summer was real ill
four-finger rings dope dealers caine/kane
no half steppin with flat tops when rakim reigned
radios on card tables benetton the gods buildin
ask for todays mathematics we allahs children
and this was goin on in every new york ghetto
kids listened five percenters said its pork and jell-o
we coincide we in the same life maybe a time difference
on a different coast but we share the same sunlight
your part of the world might be like colors and gangs
while on my side brothersll murder for different things
but it all revolve around drugs fame and shorties
stuck for your bling stripped for your chain the same story
from czechoslovakia to texas metropolis
them treacherous rocksters in the mexican mafias
be scrappin with tats on they back violent wars
nothin less than a lethal injection if ever caught
courtrooms eagles and flags american style
while in our world the ghetto stays incredibly foul
watchin for paint chips dont want no led in yo child
but them gangstas put lead in yo child the bezzy be out

si-rens wide awake whyd i think it would change
cant hide when you famous or even try to do the same things like

poking out their chest like they tall as sky scrapers

8 slug im bustin no discussion or waiting
cause now instead of coke rhymes its laying
no analog its digital criminals turned rapper times is changing
niggaz get flashier houses more plusher 
bitches giving ass up at ages more younger
hands on the clock keep turning hands on a glock they keep squeezing
bullets stop in your sternum they stop you from breathing
im light year far your mouth get all white
when im near you i frighten your heart
i want you to watch me notice stare look closely
feel im who you posed to be real i know it hurts you
soldiers approach you you want to squash it you older than most dudes
although nas did you and your whole crew but

[hook]

[nas]
i know where niggaz sleep; its too many schemes too many plots
war plus money man i got too many spots
hungry niggaz get tutored to thinking new shit to come up
killers fuck with killers you sleeping you getting stuck up
not me your not ready im low but i be watching
we all connected so your man know my man
your man knows my fam they was cool when they was locked up
beat cases and now niggaz back on the block what
bothers is taking secret routes when they drive
tinted windows ears to the street stay on their job
peep niggaz that go t prices on their head so high
their own my will take the contract surprise
so we play a mental game intimidation 
got pussy niggaz get pressed up on and paying
i wish these niggaz would step up wait for the day an
since im famous they thinking assault rifles wont be spraying
who ever thinking coming to my vault for the safe
i got some niggaz with acid get it thrown in your face
play dirty catch your moms in j-30
whatever whodie we all crazy we all 730 now

[hook]light it uhh
light it up uhh

[nas]
the whole city is mine prettiest don
i dont like the way p diddy did shyne with different lawyers
why its mentioned in my rhymes fuck it its just an intro
hate it or love it like it bump it or dump it
writing across the stomach spell god son
life is like a jungle black its like the habitat of tarzan
matter of fact its harder than most can imagine
most of my niggaz packed in correctional facilities
half of them passed on mack strong couple of shots
may the ghost leave a body now they hauntin the block
where they used to stand at somebodys takin they place
a younger man perhaps hand slaps cant understand that
same walk same talk i wonder can that be possible
a thug dies another step inside his shoes
and they will hurt you layin low with a bottle
im blowin circles my state of mind purple

light it light it uhh
yeah light it up light it up uhh

yall just wanna deal with drama
talk about niggaz who got things yall ready to kill his momma
everything you went to is underworld related
you sell your man out not even your girl is sacred
you dont trust a soul hold up you moldin soldiers
to pull guns quick and always look behind his shoulder
think of how many dudes died tryin to be down with you
everybodys under six feet of ground but you
still standin still roamin through the streets thats real
you a survivor knowin all the beef is ill
youve got a bunch of thugs witchu even now thats ready
trustin your judgment quick to put it down they deadly
the hood love you but behind your back theyve prayed for the day
a bullet hit your heart and ambulances take you away
that aint love its hate think of all the mothers at wakes
whose sons youve killed and you aint got a cut on your face
unmarked police cars roam the streets hard the heat is god
somebody tell these shorties reach for the stars
instead they tell em how to reach through the bars holdin a mirror
lookin down a tier in jail makin weapons that kill ya
weed smoke three tokes nigga pour more henny
he sighs with eyes that seen a war too many
cold-blooded murderers universal
hood to hood blowin circles my state of minds purple

light it up light it up light it up uhh
light it up light it up light it up uhh
uhh uhh uhh light it light it uhh

these hot-headed youngsters always get into trouble
reactin before thinkin they easily irritated
and murders premeditated its a fact that we sinkin
when we should be climbin in a nutshell its just jail
drug sales liquor and diamonds niggaz rewindin
instead of movin forward to blow up so whats the science
people shoutin police pushin the crowd
and on the grounds a young soldier with meat hangin out him
am i hallucinatin off the hazin
or did i just see a nigga shoot another niggas face in
its a ugly nation cops circle the block with mug shots
photograph pictures of suspect faces
its usually two or three niggaz who innocent
but if they lock the wrong ones up then someonell snitch
a divide and fall strategy they arent fair
i dig in my bag of weed thats covered with orange hair
this color purplell make whoopi give me the pussy
or celie oprah and danny glover gots to feel me
this is how i escape the madness too much of anythingll hurt you
so my state of minds all purpleuhhuhh where am i going
where am i yo its ill

[verse 1]

yo my wifes tired of fucking me
life tries ducking me
luckily i find em just at the right time
mack in my right arm tequila bottle in 
my left arm like cristian
watching my life go keeping myself in
wolves in the night yo hells men
two revolvers i can let twelve spin
hop in my benz push it to the limit
buck-sixty who wit me my  to well 
twisted blunts and inner conscience
telling me that i aint shit
no matter how much cash i sit with
still gotta ask the lord for forgiveness
my precious baby girl came like forty nights of rain
to replenish my adolescent brain
blessed be her name before her birth i was insane
so i drive the cooler pressure down delay the pain
i ate from these poisonous fucked up streets
tasted larceny it was sweet i starved for more to eat
though i took that was to live hope god will forgive
as odd as it is the more i gain the harder it is
to maintain bitches playin games
niggas snitchin i aint saying names
but yall niggas better watch how yall slang
lost so many close niggas drunk almost crashed
im going too fast highway patrol will just flash
lights in my rearview if they stop me i hope they lock me
instead they speed ahead
yo nigga watch me

[chorus]

im drunk by myself gun under my seat
i dont want none of my peeps caught up in none of my beef
im a ride to the end of the road if i have to
praying no car speeds by for me to crash to
steering wheel in my hand
trying to hold it steady
anything in my way is dead
cause thats the way i feel i am already
when im drunk by myself alone in the zone
drunk by myself

[verse 2]

heard niggas hate me but i hated too once
been in the shoes of a wolf in the night when he hunts
for every shell niggas bust we bust at ourselves
cant tell them niggas nothing though bullets wakem up well
take them to hell
stick up niggas once ran up on me
my deckited lifestyle attracted sharks on me
i aint your mark homey
its hard to look straight my foot on the brake
spilling my bottle not even shook of the jakes
could hardly look both ways put out the hayes blurry vision
think about the time in my life before i was in televison
hella women jealous niggas up in my vision
since we all hood niggas expect kilos
for what they not seeing is police expect rico
only if i could take care of everybody intoxicated
windows up blastin ac going wherever instinct takes me
i hate it when im like this
the bottles my accomplice

[chorus 1x]

[verse 3]

the reason that i want to be alone 
tired of all the things that went wrong 
that would have went right if i would have did it on my own
take another swigg
the more i drink the more i think bad thoughts
fake friends who hung around who wanna bring you down
not knowing who to trust runors about niggas coming through
supposedly to shoot at us not knowing what was true
or what to believe thats why im on the low lately
choosing a henny bottle over a friend lost again
to keep my mind off that weak shit
theres love through it all things to live for
i swerve almost crash into a wall
think about the good find myself laughing
turn the cell off no way to be reached
know im near my crib trying to see my way through the streets
reminded of the positive i take my drunk ass home
start feeling out of it cant wait to get out of this whip
bring my ass to the crib
im tired

[chorus 1x]uhh

[nas]
yo you believe when they say we aint shit we cant grow
all we are is dope dealers and gangstas and hoes
and you believe when they be tellin you lie all on the media
they make the world look crazy to keep you inside
why you listen when the teachers at school
know you a young single parent out strugglin they think you a fool
give your kids bad grades and put em in dumber classes
killin shorty future i wonder how do we last it
underground in they casket ancestors turnin
im learnin somethin every day there is no lazareth
words like god is greek or latin
so if you study egypt youll see the truth written by the masters
my niggaz is chillin gettin high relaxin
envisionin ownin shit yo it can happen
what do we own not enough land not enough homes
not enough banks to give a brother a loan
what do we own the skin on our backs we run and we ask
for reperations then they hit us with tax
and insurance if we live to be old what about now
so stop bein controlled we black zombies

[chorus sung]
walkin talkin dead though we think were livin black zombies
we just copy-cat followin the system black zombies
walkin talkin dead though we think were livin black zombies
we just copy-cat followin the system black zombies

[nas]
aiyyo we trapped in our own brain fuck behind bars
weve already gone insane
theyve already gave up cut our own heads offs
stab our own backs and dream too much
without fulfillin reality; too greedy and
cant have one or two chains we need three of dem
cant have one or two guns without squeezin em
on our own people and fuck black leaders
cause whites aint got none leadin them the rhythm is cosmic
nas is divinity the deitys prophetless
all get down and get up
victims walkin round with downs syndrome all stuck
faintin shoutin catchin holy ghost in church
scared to do it for ourselves less we see somebody doin it first
we begged we prayed petitioned and demostrated
just to make another generation - black zombies

[chorus]

[nas]
you scared to be yourself cause you in a trance
feel free hear the music and dance
if you cared what they think why wear what they wear just for you
dumb niggaz with long beards like they arabs or jews
or from israel bishmeal allah el-rachman el-rahim 
islams a beautiful thing
and christian and rastafari helps us to bring
peace against the darkness which is ungodly
so whats the black mans true religion who should we follow
use your own intuition you are tommorrow
[roaring]  thats the sound of the beast
im a columbia record slave so get paid
control your own destiny you are a genius
dont let it happen to you like it did to me i was a black zombie

[chorus]

[nas]
wake up black zombies in a spell for more than fo-hundred years
ghetto niggaz wont have it no mo can i get a witness
why listen to somebody else tell you how to do it
when you can do it yourself; its all in you do it do it
do it niggazto my nigger who brought me in this world
taught us right nigger

my old dad imported to the family structure
provide her god
my moms a queen at university civaliza
my pops maybe was late but always came home
my moms would put us to bed and she would wait on
soon as he walk in the door she barking
i turned out the jonny carson
jumped out the bed
we grabbed both his legs
me and my brother
not knowing the pain he gave my mother
night after night fighting yelling at each other
my papa played the street all day
mama was either home at work while we played inside the hall way
she sacrifices all she got to feed us
when she was alone she cried by the phone pepping out the window heeding
but still i didnt see it
mama hid it from us
we was kids younger
till we got bigger on to
bigger things that we knew what the time was
that daddy was leaving the crib and moms love

papa was player player wasnt papa 
papa loved the ladies
never got enough of
pretty brown round
running round town shhhhh
dont tell your mother whats going down
[repeat 2x]

so many kids i knew never knew what pap was
thats why i show my pop love
he was still around when i fucked up
he could have left
my moms pregnant shock to death but stayed
watch me crawl till i took my first step to the first grade
to my first fist fight
right behind me he would stand
no matter how big or tall he made me fight you like a man
throw dirt in your eye swing my right scoop your ass and slam 
he watched me so i wouldnt get jumped by shortys fam
roaches and weed all over my crib him and moms relaxing
next thing you know he packing
so then i asked him
whats this white shit on that plate and your facing
papa why you butt ass from the waist
and whos this lady im facing
dark skin youre not my mommy
he grabbed me up to run some smooth words by me
promise things that he would buy me
if i kept my mouth close and dont tell mommy
he said one day ill understand little me
was in you to side me

papa was player player wasnt papa 
papa loved the ladies
never got enough of
pretty brown round
running round town shhhhh
dont tell your mother whats going down
[repeat 2x]

pops told me hold my own
pops told me value home
could i help it papa was a rolling stone
who loved the pretty brown round
out of town bound 
jumping in his jazz benz he touring
at home i play his latest recordings
and its strange now how i do my thing now
im in the game now
and heard of it his brain pow
to pull strings and gain power
from weed habits are same now
no white lines to trumpets to tight rhymes
and beats that be pumping
before he left he taught me something
a childs young years the most important time to be there
thats why he stayed till we grew up respect is still here
im older now see what having a fathers about
one day they can be in your life next day they be out
its not because of you you know the deal
him and your moms feel
if they stay together then someone will get killed
i love you still
always will
cause thats my nigger
although you felt you was wrong
i still feel you kid
life goes onyeah
i want all my niggas to come journey with me
my name is nas and the year is 1973
beginning of me therefore i could see
through my belly button window who i am

i existed in a womb just like an abyss
came straight from spirit land my hands balled in a fist
punching on my moms stomach kicking on her cervix
twitching cause im nervous
thought my intended purpose
was to be born to reign not in scorn or vain
but to take on a name my pops chose for me
bloodstream full of indo
developing eyes looking out my belly button window
my fathers face wears a frown
and im wondering if they even want me around
cause ill go back to spirit town
so i could rest longer before i come back down
the chute again in the near future when
my moms and pops can agree on this
was here before but my moms saw her gynocologist
he dumped me off first they want me then turn around and they dont
you got a 120 days do what you want
but as for me coming back this be my last time
abort me keep me give me away make up ya mind

[nas]
i shot my way out my mom dukes

i shot my way out my mom dukes

they must wanna keep me cause 4 months past and im still alive
guess i got what you call an ill-will to survive
when i look hard the lights is killing my eyes
i know when moms is laying down cause i get bored and start to get live
move side to side hear loud music and vibe
all black babies are born with rhythm thats no lie
solar energize mineralize food through my mothers tube
im covered in this thick layer of goo
month two was the least most comfortable
my umbilical cord choking me
but month 3 was closer see
thats when pops took moms to see the doc at the clinic
but i was saved cause he changed his mind in the last minute
watching em yell heard my moms voice well
feared fist fights so terrified when we fell
while they broke up furniture and smashed plates on the wall
i wondered if i am born will i be safe at all
this place they call the world though my view was so large
couldnt wait to get up grow up and take charge
month 5 month 6 went by hoping im born in july
but the lord already figured out a date and time
septemeber 14th 73
get ready world doctors in the front waiting for me
arms open cause they know when i drop alot of shits gonna stop
see how the goverment will start re-training cops
month 9 im a week over due the labor induced
pops told my moms to push and take deep breaths too
said stay calm holding her arm im trying to hold on
surgical gloves touching my scalp my head pops out
everything blurry my first breath screams out
tears pouring down my pops face hes so proud
wanted to hold me but i was so bloody
they washed me off and he said at least that nigga aint ugly
placed me in his arms snuggly laid me on my mother
finally i got to see who held me in her body
she loved meand i plan to over through the devil
yall bout to see this world in trouble
motherfuckers[intro nas]
yea uh uh real niggaz dawg ya heard
yea journey to the life just journey

[verse one nas]
im the nigga that aint loud
throw c-low never ace out
only move out wit a particular crew i hate crowds
the observer money and murder the hood praise it
i was raised in it early age
was presented with the ultimatum
be a boss with a army drop the atari games
hard cocaine that had my neighborhood strung out
brains numb out guns out
i was smart high hopes in my heart
but dope cartels would emerge
bloody shirts on niggaz while they hollerin
til their lungs dont work
figures i end up with a scarred memory of my youth
with dudes in the drug loot feelin henny shoot
my nigga will still here man i wish it was truth
buried in his favorite shit fila sneakers and fila suit
my eyes are the window of my soul
my niggaz let the indo roll
thinkin time flies we gettin old
thats the words of my right hand man my main dawg
we been rollin since day one he down for the cause
all he talk is extortion kidnap shit big gat shit
im like - yo think positive but he act sick
he only think about lettin his mac spit
he like fuck who he hit
me it bothers cause he know im rent em it regardless
if he keep wildin out hes makin both of us targets
so i pull him tell him on some deep shit try to school em
we already lost niggaz by how we was movin
we still livin but our lives need much improvin
i think im gonna lose em

[chorus nas]
i was blind in this world
all i thought about was diamonds and pearls
i had beef wit a nigga then im clappin his girl
nappin his kids ransack and run through his rib
blow up his moms crib theres no way he could live
its gettin clearer starin at the man in the mirror
like all this time its just a fragment of my mind
come to find out shit wasnt what is made to be
in reality +my worst enemy+ was me

[verse two nas]
feelin like i got the dons clout
trigger pawn cocked glocks spray up your moms spot
i aint playin wit you war fuck pistols
bring machines icy bell buckles ten guns m-1s with ice muzzles
lifes a struggle get your wifey touch too everybody involved
homicide doctors patchin up your war scars
task force chargin at us news flash thug crews blast at officers
coroners pick you up from the grass
livin fast til somebody tries meltin my chest
im high loosin it could of hit my own self with the tec
refuse to quit but i tried tellin me to relax
its like i cant hear my words til im trapped to the max
even then i blame everybody else except me pops left me
i was just three i cried for help moms was busy
that dont mean niggas stupid
but i got a habit wit - makin up excuses
was born ruthless hated school they aint teach me im a bad seed
planted in this ghetto where my niggaz cant read
multiply subtract; only knowin how to count cracks and count stacks
now what yall know about that
one side of me wanted out of this life
glue traps on the floor for the mice
til the nigga saw the light
i wanted money when i got it i would spend it
i wanted jewels but when i heard it yo i wouldnt listen
all of the drama in my life i got my self into
all the toxins my body took in faded my mental
i let these niggaz words get to me
but im tired of my ice tired of bentley
its the end of the century
i recognized the world is a beautiful place
niggaz opinions ruinin my musical taste
cause everytime i caught a case could of got me in jail
if you wasnt scared of jail you more likely to fail
i thought the whole world was cursed from the hand i was dealt
and +my worst enemy+ was my self
word to my selfword to my selfword to my self

[chorus nas]
i was blind to the world
all i thought about was diamonds and pearls
i had beef wit a nigga then im clappin his girl
nappin his kids ransack run through his rib
blow up his moms crib theres no way he could live
its gettin clearer starin at the man in the mirror
cause all this time it was a fragment in my mind
come to find out shit wasnt what is made to be

girls i got em locked so similar to a prison

im homicidal pointin the pump scope to shoot you
street connects mob ties on east and west
we gouge out your eye balls if you seen too much
hopin out drops wit blings and stuff
wit ball players wives mercedes 5
dangerous lives and haters die rollin with convicts
conscience who tolerate no nonsense
fake rappers in doo-rags get shot-up at their concert
your bitch bleed bitin her nipples with my chipped tooth
i drink her blood like im dracula mack in the 6-coupe
the sky becomes red heard yall niggaz work with the feds
doesnt matter bloodll splatter everybody must dead
i got urge for self-reinvention but im old-fashioned
from the corners with the winos laughin
dealers and five-o blastin
capitalist thoughts like presidents
im burnin bushs nas the realest its nuttin to fuck wit

[chorus uncredited female nas]
you think you know me but i tell em ma
dont think so dont think so

	and what you dont know will get yourself killed
about me
	see what you dont know me youll never will
	and what you dont know will get yourself killed
youll never know

[verse two nas]
i smoke weed like them sixties rebellions hippies on heroin
spliffs inhalin what i speak strictly for felons
dippin in their 6-4 hittin the switches
or sittin in their bentley azures feelin the riches
or just ridin truck drivin impalas denalis
i fuck with those but i lust for silver ferraris
i fuck hoes with the ceilings have mirrors to watch me
my bed shaped like a pyramid feelin the dry heat
spillin courvoisi im half slave-master
half apache half african much is what i call us black men
lead astray drugs and cups of alcohol cause back when
they let us off ships; the soul of man was lost or trapped in
but every ghetto every hood no matter where the town
its all haunted all on top slave burial grounds
dead cooks workers and maids under this earth in rage
ancient whore houses that explain my sexual ways
money and murder interprets the american dream
the world loves a gangsta i found my place in this thing
royces diamonds and bosses woman whore gorgeous
traitors killers and enemies remorseless we live this

[chorus uncredited female nas]

[verse three nas]
gypsies preachers choirs churches liquor stores
the world is full of liars curses people rich or poor
without god to worship see we would be more lost
gotta believe in somethin or their would be no laws
a ghetto child occasionally blunted in mansions
my cup overflow with cristal hundred exotic dancers
niggaz is plastic ass gets jealous and passive
my pistol blast at; cowards leechers and rappers
niggaz i fuck with is bravehearts make gs
before rap music to me was wind blowin the trees
birds chirpin rain fallin perfect and free
but bitches saw my video and think they know me
these niggaz bad talkin claimin they gon do me
stay out my path homey you fuckin wit a true g
bitch +you dont know me+

[chorus uncredited female nas]get-get get down

pushin cars nicky barnes was the 70s
but theres a long list of high-profile celebrities
worldwide on the thorough side of things
livest kings some died one guy one time
one day grabs me as im about to blast heat
40-side of vernon i turned well he asked me
whatchu up to the cops gon bust you
i was a teen drunk off brew stumbled i wondered
if god sent him cause two squad cars entered the block
and looked at us i aint flinch when they watched
i took it upstairs the bathroom mirror brushed my hair
starin at a young disciple i almost gave my life to what the dice do
yeah man throwin them bones
hopin my ace get his case thrown
his girl aint wait for him she in the world straight hoein
while he lookin at centerfolds of pretty girls
showin they little cooch gangstas dont die hes livin proof
the da who tried him was lyin
a white dude killed his mother durin the case
hung jury now the da is bein replaced
pre-trial hearin is over its real for the soldier
walks in the courtroom the look in his eyes is wild
triple-homicide i sit in the back aisle
i wanna crack a smile when i see him
throw up a fist for black power cause all we want is his freedom
he grabbed a court officers gun and started squeezin
then he grabbed the judge screams out - nobody leavin everybody

[nas]
yall dont know about my biggie wars
who you thought kick in the door was for
but thats my heart yall still trippin of this jigga shit
real niggas listen up and imma tell you how the whole thing start
off top i brung queens up from hard times
rockin at the fever streets was all mine
it was my version of the blues droppin our schools
the crack epidemic had rap representin new rules
so i got in em shoes tried em wore them
wasnt a perfect fit so i couldnt sport em
young murderers ride i knew all them
jungle got shot will died we was warring
i wrote it in my album
i was 18 when lake seen the island
and lord held me down and
my surroundings started changing
i had a baby i was making my rounds with az
niggas started noticing my flow and was open when
the golden child closed em in with more style than them older men
puff tried to start a label prince rakeem had formed wu-tang
snoop and dre had a new thang
so puff drove his new range through queensbridge projects
he let me drive it before ready to die hit
big and i hit blunts performing at the arc
next thing you knew big blew and all the balling starts
he had kim and his crew i found fox only niggas in new york with number 
one charts
big was ahead of his time him and raekwon my niggas
but dig it they couldnt get along
thats when ghostface said it on the purple tape
bad boy biting nas album cover way
big told me rae was stealing my slang
and rae told me out in shaolin big would do the same thing
but i borrowed from both them niggas
jigga started to flow like us but hit with aint no niggas
had much versace swagger
big admired the brooklyn knight and it took him in as iceberg the rapper
today dont know nothing about this bullshit
theres more shit than wanting to be this king of new york shit
[chorus 2x]

[nas]
rap became a version of malcom and martin
rest in peace will queensbridge live on
theres some ghetto secrets i cant rhyme in this song
theres some missing pieces i had to leave out
i had lot trust for steve stoute
at some point till i got to know him
we old friends but whats loyal
puff soaked interscope offices
with champagne bottles on steve and steve thought the drama is on me
cause previously it would have been against whoever
friends forever
however i learn with some niggas its all business
but im a street dude with morals
to diss niggas with jigga too much he used to say jay wanted my spot
i laughed stayed home never hung a lot
a quiet man who used to be alone planning
baby moms thought i was too quiet couldnt stand it
she hit the streets later on she hittin the sheets
with a rapper who wanted me on his songs thinking he strong
i taught her how to watch for cars that might follow
tauht her street shit that i know
her weakness was shine yo
but thats her i aint mad baby it made me stronger
now i get my paper longer
illmatic i was boss
it was written i flossed
one of the most creative lps ever to hit stores
in the firm i learned i am nastradamus
qbs finest oochie wally faced more problems
i gave it all up so i can chill at home with mama
she was getting old and sick so i stayed beside her
we had the best times she asked would i make more songs
i told her not till i see her health get more strong
in the middle of that jay tried to sneak attack
assasinate my character degrade my hood
cause in order for him to be the don nas had to go
the gam-b-i-n-o rules i understood
what you want see i already had
the gift and the curse fuck that shit the first shall be last
im the mans man a rappers rapper
g-o-d s-o-n theyll be none after
i was scarface jay was manolo
it hurt me when i had to kill him and his whole squad for dolo for dolo

i can be what you said
that you need i can beall that
i can be i can have your back babyi know i can
be what i wanna be
if i work hard at it
ill be where i wanna be
[i know i can] i know i can
[be what i wanna be] be what i wanna be
[if i work hard at it] if i work hard at it
[ill be where i wannna be] ill be where i wanna be

b b boys and girls listen up
you can be anything in the world in god we trust 
an architect doctor maybe an actress
but nothin comes easy it takes much practice
like i met a woman who was becoming a star 
she was very beautiful leaving people in awe
singin songs later on but the younger version
hung wit the wrong person got her stunger than heroine
cocaine sniffin up drugs all in her nose
couldve died so young now looks ugly and old
no fun cause now when she reaches for hugs people hold thier breath 
cuz she smells of corrosion and death
watch the company you keep and the crowd you bring 
cause they came to do drugs and you came to sing
so if you gonna be the best ima tell you how
put your hands in the air and take the vow

i know i can i know i can
be what i wanna be be what i wanna be
if i work hard at it if i work hard at it
ill be where i wanna be ill be what i wanna be
[i know i can] i know i can
[be what i wanna be] be what i wanna be
[if i work hard at it] if i work hard at it
[ill be where i wanna be] ill be where i wanna be

b b boys and girls listen again
this is for grown looking girls whos only ten
the ones who watch videos and do what they see
as cute as can be up in the clubs with fake id
careful fore you meet a man with hiv
you can host a tv like oprah winfrey
whatever you decide be careful some men be 
rapists so act your age dont pretend to be 
older than you are give yourself time to grow 
youre thinking he can give you wealth but so 
young boy you could use a lot of help you know
ya thinkin lifes all about smokin weed and ice
you dont wanna be my age and cant read and write
beggin different women for a place to sleep at night
smart boys turn to men and do whatever they wish
if you believe you can achieve then say it like this

i know i can i know i can
be what i wanna be be what i wanna be
if i work hard at it if i work hard at it
ill be where i wanna be ill be what i wanna be
[i know i can] i know i can
[be what i wanna be] be what i wanna be
[if i work hard at it] if i work hard at it
[ill be where i wanna be] ill be where i wanna be

b before we came to this country
we were kings and queens never porch monkeys
there was empires in africa called kush
timbuktu where every race came to get books
to learn from black teachers who taught greeks and romans
asians arabs and gave them gold; when 
gold was converted to money it all changed
money then became empowerment for europeans
the persian military invaded
they heard about the gold the teachings and everything sacred
africa was almost robbed naked
slavery was money so they began making slaveships
egypt was the place that alexander the great went
he was in shock that in the mountains were black faces
shot off their nose to impose what basically
still goes on today you see
if the truth is told the youth can grow
theyll learn to survive until they gain control
nobody says you have to be gangsters hoes
read more learn more change the globe
ghetto children do your thing
hold your head up little man youre a king
young princess when you get your wedding ring
your man is saying shes my queen

i know i can i know i can
be what i wanna be be what i wanna be
if i work hard at it if i work hard at it
ill be where i wanna be ill be what i wanna be
[i know i can] i know i can
[be what i wanna be] be what i wanna be
[if i work hard at it] if i work hard at it
[ill be where i wanna be] ill be where i wanna be

but wait a minute we both need ya mothers attention

kinda crazyi want you to close ur eyes n invision 
the most beautiful place in tha world
if you in the hood the ghetto street corner
come on this journey the best journey its a mansion
acres of land swimmin pools and all that check it out

[verse 1] - nas

im capable of anything my imagination could give me wings 
to fly like doves over the streets watchin many things
kids walkin home from school on drug blocks missionaries
pass out papers that read love god
i see faces cases judges n jurors masons lawyers n cops 
i watch cuz every thugs face is my mirror
but this was one imparticular
this kid he was the vintage stick em up pro
16 years old did his jail since there was no where to go
every mornin calls his commrad to come n get em a smoke
he insane already gone mad blames himself for his setbacks
dangerous street corners where his sets at
sling from dusk till dawn detectives act like they maniacs
chasin him his ass was flarin
smokin like a chimney on remy of course he not carin
he needs a place to go to keep his mind expandin
i give em a helpin hand bring em out to thugz mansion

[hook]

every corner every city theres a place where lifes a lil easy 
lil hennesey lay back and cool every hour cuz its all good
leave all the stress from the world outside every wrong done
will be alright nothin but peace love n street passion
every ghetto needs a thugs mansion

[verse 2] - tupac

dear mama dont cry your baby boys doin good
tell the hommies im in heaven and it aint got hoods
seen a show with marvin gaye last night
it had me shook drinking 
peppermint schnapps with jackie wilson and sam cook
then some lady named billie holiday sang
sittin there kickin it with malcolm till the day game
lil latasha sure grown tell the lady in the liquor store that shes forgiven
so come home
maybe in time youll understand only god can save us
where miles davis cutting lose with the band
just think of all the people that you knew in the past that passed on
they in heaven found peace that last
picture a place that they exist together
there has to be a place better than this in heaven
so right before i sleep dear god what im asking
remember this face save me a place
in thugz mansion

[hook] wanna gowanna go

[verse 3] - nas

a place where death doesnt reside jus thugz who collide
not to start beef but to spark trees no cops rollin by
no policemen no homicide no chalk on the streets
no reason for no bodys momma to cry
see im a good guy im tryin to stick around for my daughter
but if i should die i know all of my albums support her
this whole years been crazy asked the holy spirit to save me
only difference from me and ossie davis grey hair maybe 
cuz i feel like my eyes saw to much sufferin
im just 20 some odd years i done lost my mother
and i cry tears of joy i know she smiles on her boy
i dream of you more my love goes to afeni shakur
cause like anne jones she raised a ghetto king in a war
and just for that alone she shouldnt feel no pain no more
cause one day well all be together sipping heavenly champagne
where angels soar with golden rings in thugz mansionchorus
a mastermind
sees it coming before it comes
a mastermind
before he go to war he count his ones
a mastermind
everything planned out perfect-incase you niggas got to get murdered
a mastermind
sleeps at night real easy
a mastermind
cause everything he does is by the book
a mastermind
never do a thing irrational-live forever these tales are classical

verse1
velvet bowtie
bulletproofs in the tux when i roll by
in the car similar to osamas
in my diamonds and my principle is to study drama
look what happened in manhattan a couple of years ago when guns started clapping
two of my dogs fell
two of my niggas ran
they were amateurs in beef with a grown man
they taught me the lessons of how the strong stand
and how the weak end up in the coffin
play it cool thats the old school rule man
keep your ears to the street youll never loose man
make you enemies believe theres love there
because in war believe its all fair
rock em to sleep
shots in your jeep
and you aint never know the plot was for me
its for my masterind

chorus

verse2
it aint a game its the life
think its a game you lame and im nice
on the blackstone marlowe

weather below zero-gave the keys to kelis
whispered in her ear lobe drive home
cause she the wife and they the freaks
they underneath my girl calliber
they smiled at her said goodbye with niggas
they thugged out they wild as us

chorus[nas]

look dumb but massively notice the weakness in all them
gotta shoot only if necessary 
homey vest is very real if enemies carrying heavy steal
beware the thugs who aint scared of blood or jail time
where arian nations aint having integration we so blind
the beauty of life was when my mom said nigga you could be christ
i wasnt old enough to hold my dick and pee right jesus
what is he like i picture him standing with diamonds on him
little different from the way my mommy saw him
practice your aiming physical training in difficult terrain and
test your endurance try to keep your stamina banging

teaching smart ways to kill im thinking ghandi was a fool
but chronics a fool; got me thinking out loud fuck it
sleep on my drunkenness ill blow your brains out 

[chorus]

[lake]

fuck the beef ill snatch your seed from chuckie cheese 
and feed him to the rats in the back of the ps 
black fatigues and r15 on the sofa
50 inch flat screen louie vitton holdsters
my motions dont appeal to repel at divisions
i did it strong for 7 long years in prison fuck the system
im like a modern day hitler black gorilla crip and blood in one nigga

chorus x2i dream of the day i can go back to when i was born
laying in your arms wishing you was here today mom
wish youd appear just for a second from heaven 
my tears would be gone i wouldnt be rapping this song
id be happy driving up to your eight bedroom mansion
up late laughing bout the hard times we faced
the galaxy is so enchanted beyond 
galileos understanding pass the milky way and all the planets 
theres something out there greater but only god knows
scientists claim we came from apes but they lies tho 
that was part of our conversation 
a spark when up and start blazing thinking of how amazing she was 
an angel gave me love
im thankful to ever know a woman so real
i pray when im married my wife 
i have one of your skills but mom you could never be replaced 
i give my life up just to see you one more day and to have 

one more dance with you mama *if i could only have*
one more dance with you mama *pray wishing i could have*
one more dance with you mama *if i could only have*
one more dance with you mama 

i wish you were here i miss you more each second i breath
you resting in peace forever i accepted you free 
a blessing to me
i see you dressed in all white smiling at me 
happy knowing everythings alright
if only i could hear your voice and your laughter just one more time 
my chest would be filled up with sunshine
april 7th 02 that when the gates of heaven opened up for you 
to stroll through
beautiful ann jones 
job is done raisin ghetto kids in the hood 
you was my strength to carry on and now im good 
job well done you lived through your sons and grandchildren 
jesus finally got his bride mommy dance with him 
and you been my guide through all the trouble i face 
they playing our song the light be 
my hand on your waist
i grab your other hand trying not to step on your toes 
spin you around with my eyes closed dreaming i could have

one more dance with you mama *if i could only have* 
one more dance with you mama *pray wishing i could have*
one more dance with you mama *if i could only have*
one more dance with you mama i love you forever ma

you have always lived through me
alwaysif heaven was a mile away
would i pack up my bags and leave this world behind
if heaven was a mile away
or save it all for you
if heaven was a mile away
would i fill the tank up with gas and be out the front door in a flash
before reconsidering this hell with you
it aint you its the things you do do
its tearing my heart in two
i would of fell with you
to hell with you

[nas]
if heaven was a mile away
and you could ride by the gates
would you try to run inside when it opens would you try to die today
would you pray louder finally believing his power
even if you couldnt see but you could feel would you still doubt him
how would you start acting
would you try to put the kis down
thinking every drug sell that you make in the streets he can see now
would a fiend even want to get high would he stop smoking
if he knew on his own two feet he could just stroll in
to get away and escape from the craziness
and i bet you theres a heaven for an atheist
its hard taking this
racist planet where they take another brother in a handcuff
even if he innocent nigga get on the car put your motherfucking hands up
thinking im a lose it
my moms in chemo
three times a week yo keep trying but people
is hard and god your young soldiers not so bold
but need you
this worlds my home but world i would leave

if heaven was a mile away
would i pack up my bags and leave this world behind
if heaven was a mile away
or save it all for you
if heaven was a mile away
would i fill the tank up with gas and be out the front door in a flash
before reconsidering this hell with you
it aint you its the things you do do
its tearing my heart in two
i would of fell with you
to hell with you

[nas]
nigga what you think ima stop building
ima stop feeling like im amistads great great grandchildren
how im not gonna want to make millions
since the quarter water days in the hallways making fake coke
pass with the reeses pieces wrapper in my mouth all day
but then my style has quite a while that same type as ill and al skratch
game time to them cats never looked back cristal blowing dub sacks
thats when it all just hit me
you see the broads and bentleys is nothing less my nigga spend it all with me
id give it all away quickly
just to hear them all id buy some new kicks free of any autographs so
not to be recognized forgive me
its becoming unbearable 
making hits is easy
put a famous bitch on the hook there you go with a platinum cd
i know you heard the noise
preachers touching on altar boys
sodomizing not realizing god is watching before the lord
how can they do the devils work
a man giving another man head in church
hell it hurts just to fathom the thought wishing that i fled the earth

if heaven was a mile away
would i pack up my bags and leave this world behind
if heaven was a mile away
or save it all for you
if heaven was a mile away
would i fill the tank up with gas and be out the front door in a flash
before reconsidering this hell with you
it aint you its the things you do do
its tearing my heart in two
i would of fell with you
to hell with you[verse 1]
yo my man was regulatin on niggas he used to thug with
older niggas in this murder game drug czars
bm jaguars they cash was large
since he was wild they let him in

to put himself deeper under they wing

studied they movements - who would kill who was strong
studied like a student got it bloody he was shootin

cause the streets move fast you blink you could miss it

real relaxed readin real loves stories like
ceaser and cleopatra we need another actress to play her
cause liz taylors hot but the egyptian queen
on the movie screen needs to be portrayed in a proper flava
hopped in the shower threw on the boxers with the baby oil
baby powder night owl movin to later hours only
fuckin with kings niggas official
if you phony come in the circle niggasll diss you
we converse on the state of hip hop
we share the same views and feelings

he pointed to the front row thought he was losing his mind
she was supposed to be with her sick mother
left for the weekend stress when she was leaving now she next to some nigga cheesin
hes having trouble breathing breathing
he pictured them making noises grindin em and kissin em
yellin aint no telling where her lips have bin
left her foul messages she came home no lesser then
ten minutes later and they start wrestling and screamin
she said she missed her flight that evening
she never left she wasnt at the fight u speakin
thats vegas this is new york you bugin
i held up my hand for dat but he wouldnt touch it
i was like when u started actin like that this is dumbness
gave me a crazy look and started swingin punches
i ducked couldnt believe it the niggas so wet 
he got his gad and started squeezin hit two police men
neighbors dialed 911 they heard the thumpin
wounded cops kicked in the door and started dumpin
me and his wife hit to the floor she smelt strange
my comrade was breathing no more they killed james

[verse 2 nas]
a message to those who trapped us up from federal guys who backed them up
we never will die we black and tough lead in your eye we strapped to bust
half of us been locked up inside the beast look at the time we see
brooklyn to compton streets queens even the congo needs dreams
our bullets and triggers our enemies pullin on innocent women and children
it wasnt no ghetto killers who mixed up the coke and put guns in our buildings
but im not gon cry and im not gon just stand and watch you die
ima pass you a 9 ima grab your hand -- come on lets ride
a message to those who killed the king who murdered the christ
the same regime what god has built you never can break
what god has loved you never can hate man makes rules and laws
you just a ruthless dog your kennel is waiting
you devils will run back into the caves you came from
whenever that day comes forty-acres plantations see every race won
sincerely yours streets disciple revelations[man laughing]

but who are we to blame not the dames

im bored so i followed him
nikki beach heres where the scene begins
he put me on to don nice ass with a set of mean twins
had a pocket full of cash sekou wasnt lettin me spend
i was there for the weekend packed and prepared for anything
then he brings me to his castle in coconut grove

whole room will quiet down just to hear my last words
tears fall down my facial why fear anything its now too late to
im dreaming of a time i was silked out at the peak of my career
but i always choked out leaving mad money on the table at crazy amounts
i would hit the scene for a second and bounce
admit i did live a little bit sweet pickle dick
freaks licked on it lips i dripped on it

traveled half the world wish i traveled the rest of it

a stand-up dude held me down after sekou
need more brothers like you in the hood would have wifed you if i could
but the white cells in my blood were no good
said i had it ten years but i was just a carrier
i thought me a victim could never be my character
its ill se passed the way he did didnt know how to tell him
just happy it didnt get in our kid
but all the things i did was the flyest experiences were priceless
remember days of diamond cuts
nugget rings clubs in queens jetta cars
used to love them things barbados belize
i stayed over seas shopping sprees credit cards
pockets of gs left the hood phattest cribs
to platinum from silver came back bitches calling me the black liz taylor
imagine that rob me my nigga would kill ya they knew the rules
all the planes i flew niggaz i ran through
lot of unprotected sex dont know where it came from
grimy niggaz rich niggaz damn it aint a game son

and most of all you gotta live now

so i would go to school and try to get good grades
teacher wrote mommy and kicked me outta school for havin braids
so she cussed them said my son aint no motherfuckin hoodlum
they judged us thinking that we dumb cause where we come from
got a little older and now i see
young niggaz wanted by the powers that be powers that be

[verse 2 nas]
uh picture a black nanny and a baby in a basket pushin down 5th ave
she never had it its not hers to begin with
she gives it breakfast baths and dinners
treats it so tender while her own kids live alone at home with no phone on
aint had a good meal in so long but so long as mommys a maid
cookin and cleanin she wanna feed her kids and her kids are dreamin
wheres my daddy whos my daddy have you seen him
i could imagine them askin what type of human be-ing
could leave his family go back to the carribean
was he locked up shot up does he have freedom
mom said wipe your tears keep readin
but daddys somewhere spirit broken feelin defeated
a man feels he has to conquer all
the world is his oyster his pearl so yall know

[chorus woman singing]
i cant find no reason why we cant all live in peace

yeah yeah yeah
you was born in the eighties pops drove a mercedes
did a bid coming home to some grown ass kid
crack baby turn to young thug description might fit you
look around it might hit you
no joke i wanna pistol fight with you
shit comes around faster than you think
blood and white chalk makes pink so whats that make you
become a creature of habitat the average cat
wont see where its at or where its going
the hood waits for no one
ive been through it from ewings to buicks to body viewings
car chases to court cases to fly vacations
from wanting it all to being the object of your admiration
imagination is what they lack
it stops niggaz from getting stacks
feeling trapped on the block with loose cracks
wisdom is vital for the survival of the streets disciple

[chorus]
from the day you were born olu daru sample

moonstruck stuck slow as molasses in my actions
thats compliments of a fast spliff in the night life
in my flight jacket adrenaline heightened mimickin tyson
after watchin him cut up razor ruddock
in the gutter which was once ghetto prophecy is now ghetto scripture
lookin back at it blowjobs from pretty crack addicts
older gods wantin no static told some lil niggaz they can have it
coke baggin and toe-taggin
they took will let me describe him a live one
i think that he was the true +gods son+ - not jesus but fearless
his ear was up on them sounds too hed hear somethin
not to his likin and say son they bitin you
he never got to see my debut wild-mannered
but wild with them hammers niggaz frontin couldnt stand it
took him off the planet left us in 9-2
with the philosophy of what arms do a true streets disciple

[chorus]

[nas]
plug the mics up im ready to rock knocking
reminiscing of measuring pots of pyrex cook in the kitchen
captain hook to these infants
its like my folks is still on the benches
surrounded by villains and henchmen was a killer convention
1991 son gold fronts on the facial gun buck by the naval
disciple could blaze you we laced it with embalming fluid
rhyming to music all this time
fighting bout how kane and rakim would do it
seemed impossible to us that we could ever leave
from the block where the world was forever freezing
hell if i ever let them shovel me son in this cell again
fuck these devil policemen plush leathers i need them
risking my freedom burners in bubble coats
fuck a sermon from the neighborhood pope
hes sexing hos old fart hes busting ones when he stroke
multi-colored pelle pelles young stretch mark bellies
babies born in a cycle future disciples

[verse 1]
january 28 1968
born into this world as william griffin the great
chapter 1 wyndanch long island
scientific rhymin invented a new sound when he met with
eric barrier from east sandhurst
the melody they created was the first
burst on the scene 1986 with clap to this
87 dropped a classic disc
the facts is the tracklist was like four
the vocals the beats -- according to marly marl
recorded in my hometown queensbridge
thats why its so relative
this biography was unauthorized
i spit it how it was given to author nas
william changed his name at sixteen to rakim allah
cause clarence 13x had new york on lock
gods on every block jams in every park
i remember hearin curtis blow saying
it cant get better than this
til run dmc blew my brains to bits
from leather coats to shell toes to the stan smiths to dapper dan kicks
first million-dollar deal ever in rap 18th letter did that
from 41st &amp; broadway to uni to mca
we followed the leader to harlems apollo theatre
supreme rapped and the 50 that dont rap
forte green queens long island wolfpack
paid in full posse hot they was on
and ra had his firstborn
with the next line ima be easy
his wisdoms name is fifi
epmd put a record out was dope
tension spread and i quote smack me and i smack you back
sounded like the answer to the i aint no joke track
for a second it aint look good
little tension buzzin from wyndanch to brentwood
misunderstood all forgot by sixteen when i met freddy foxx
totin burners the whole coasts most concern was
how was rakims flow made christians convert with islamic ways
let the rhythm hit em was the third lp
a sophisticated mean one before similar voices were king son
a few others but sooner or later the game was ras kingdom
at sixteen son was watchin him mesmorized
respect not jockin him was so amazin besides
he came on the stage with lasers in his eyes
walk with me now

chelsea used to tell me choke her while i stroke her
stuck a heineken bottle up in the ass a real joker
used to run my bubble bath tons of laughs sexy chick
mad skills she used to try to eat my excrement
used to play atari 1200 baby-sitter made me kiss her
put hickeys on her stomach
toya was a tomboy til we played catch a screw
had her out past her curfew sheila had this perfume
that drove a nigga wild was a child then gertrude
used to put my face in her crotch
spun my tongue around in a circle while she watched
eiserea knew i was a player brought fatima loud screamer

while marvin gaye pumped from the speaker

the weather was cold and loretta would throw on nothing but a thong

in slippers and a sun dress for me to arrive
kept a freak in the ride with her head in my lap the steering wheels high

[nas]
a ghoul at night i role like jack the ripper trying to choose my wife
i need a ass of a stripper fat lipper
mad niggaz in this one predicament
you try to choose a loyal one and stick with it
my stupid dick again searching for something to jump and then start humpin
convincing me that the history of a woman is about leaving a nigga with nothing
so my experiences taught me how to come up with a plan to make a right one for the man
a toy for the boy the one that righteously will understand
and since i cant find her i guess i gotta make her
i creep in the night like a kinky undertaker
i think im on a caper to abduct a nerd from the ivy league
next stop at the strip club snatch a bad one and flee
whats next im stakin out a five star restaurant to kidnap the chef
say goodbye to the stress

[chorus]

[nas]
i stitch em together then i kiss em forever
these surgical gloves are made of love couldnt be better
four cycles of blood child birth first
men-e-stral cycle last men-e-stral cycle then death
thats four so i guess rebirth is the fifth
put em together thats a genius a slut and a chef
holdin the scalpel while cutting the flesh
heavy bleeding so i need suction its such a mess
if she survives shell be sucking me next
dark nipples on her d-cup breasts so i could titty fuck while she do
my taxes for the irs
so i could just relax shit by now im blessed
im her daddy im her messiah im god
cause i injected obedience and loyalty in her heart
know you mad cause you with a bitch that nag you to death
i smack mine on the ass and she breathe her first breath

[chorus]

[nas]
gimme sades mystique she gotta know her way in the streets
like billie holiday in harlem
body from ketoi johnson and kenya moore and apple bottoms
maya angelous brain and some groove from terry mcmillan
them angelina jolie lips angela davis sista souljahs wit
helping me load clips
some words form a pimp was nas it just dont exist
but homes is twisted a home aint a home without without the misses
all the girls that i named are queens no disrespect
but i need me someone to disappear reappear like i dream of jeannie
whenever i want i think i met her its on forever ill flaunt

[chorus][chorus]
say hello to the man goodbye to the gigolo
it was difficult for me to find a chick i want

[nas]
this aint no sucka for love shit
this aint no huxtable kisses and hug shit first night we fuck shit
and dont call the next day this a thugs wedding day
in love will we make it let us pray
in a limo my niggas my father my brothers
everybody in tuxes gettin blunted
hard bottasmov costumes this aint no act though
factual the pimp shall scoop no more
yes im absolutely sure

we spoke on a prenuptial agreement cuz will and jada aint need it

cuz she deserves cinderellas ball and the whole shit
but know this you fuckin wit a slit ya throat quick
vehicular explosions cigar smokin
dark-minded chart climbin well-spoken
safer world of broke men to rich ones
throw them phone numbers away cuz this is it hun
headed to the chapel my niggas laughin

its weird though i knew id get married
to who i knew not thought of snatchin halle up from the dreadlock
pumpin sade my head knot
finally i met the perfect bitch pardon my french rephrase that 
someone who made my heart stop couldnt wait to blaze that
tired of hoppin from honey to honey
hiv spreadin everybody bump the same bunnies
the gamell put niggas in they graves right before they part ways with the street
i want a son to greet every mornin
daughters and more sons tickle my feet
wife smilin tellin me its time to eat
im gettin married

[chorus x3]

[nas]
it was my dream for my queen to put the ring on the ride
even martin luther king had a fling on the side
thats what the negative ones say
knew my wedding would be one day but quickly is this day
i know the hoes gonna miss me
lookin at old photos sayin damn he used to twist me
start chokin up since i woke up
bachelor party was crazy tryin hard just to sober up
father saw me in a daze knudged me with his left arm
told me how him and moms went to city hall dressed norm
said she would love me oswald boateng
customized in london by guys who suit up kings
gov you got the ring jung you behave
maxwell he gon sing invited lauryn hill and the gang
baltimore north cacky mississippi
family packed in my nigga l is crazy tipsy
spilled pepsi on the cufflinks ginger ale got it out
walked in the church just all big to thug it out
my girl walked in glistenin different stones
bout to go from my fiance to mrs jones
thats a union that nobody can touch
i gotta be cool wit ya crazy aunts and uncles
cuz i love you muchcuz you put up wit my shit
court cases baby mommas

[intro olu dara singing]
see i come from mississippi
i was young and runnin wild
ended up in new york city where i had my first child
i named the boy nasir all the boys call him nas
i told him as a youngster hell be the greatest man alive

[verse 1 nas]
lets go hey-hey-hey-hey -- 
tribrary of these rap skits styles i mastered
many brothers snatched it up and tried to match it
but im still number one everyday real
speak what i want i dont care what yall feel
cause im my own master my pop told me be your own boss
keep integrity at every cost and his home was natchez mississippi
did it like miles and dizzy now we gettin busy
bridging the gap from the blues to jazz to rap
the history of music on this track
born in the game discovered my fathers music 
like prince searchin through boxes of purple rain
but my minneapolis was the bridge home of the superkids
some are well-known some doin bids
i mighta ended up on the wrong side of the tracks
if pops wouldntve pulled me back an said yo
[olu dara singing]
greatest man alive nas yeah turn it up
gre-gre-gre-gre-greatest man alive

[verse 2 nas]
the blues came from gospel gospel from blues
slaves are harmonizin them ahs and oohs
old school new school know school rules
all these years i been voicin my blues
im a artist from the start hip-hop guided my heart
graffiti on the wall coulda ended in spoffard juvenile delinquent
but pops gave me the right typea tools to think with
books to read like x and stuff
cause the schools said the kids had dyslexia
in art class i was a compulsive sketcher of
teachers in my homeroom i drew pix to mess them up
cause nonea them would like my style
read more books than the curriculum profile
said mr jones please come get your child
cause hes writin mad poems and his verses are wild
[olu dara singing]
greatest man – the great-greatest man alive

[verse 3 nas]

madagascar paris greece

yo im hot like 95 fahrenheit
on a summer night tight spot where bodies rot
rats drink from water drops in the streets niggaz
little kids scared cops wit red dots
philosophical gangsta where violent priors
goin back like black and white tvs wit pliers
leanin on broke down cars wit flat tires
flash iron or anybody tryin on the blocks im supplyin on
mighty call my peeps tie ballons up
and swallow em and the penal got goons lots of em
cops see them and run dont want no drama
certain parts of the streets the beast dont want a part of
mortar hood haunted like the dakota
where john lennon was shot up but he sang for peace
he begged for freedom hanged wit wild jamicians
from kingston who drink irish moss

got ill up on the train twistin off a cap
of a english in my vain might of pushed you on the tracks
death crack fiends who cant speak scream noises
cause you bought a drummer sooked from one of my boys its

warehouse crime rate mans throw they vans up
bang job freeze everybody put your hands up
cash is nightmare gun in ya faceplate
its not even ya money dont make me put one in ya face mate
thieves running this place world trade eight fare
slave rift flashbacks; bush killer hate blair

on a skyway railroad to stick you from my tray fair bitch

and for that we not takin it lightly
if hip hop should die we die together

cant clean my act up for good too much thug in em 
prolly end up back in the hood like fuck it then 

huddling over the oven we was like brothers then 
though you was nothing another then the son of my mothers friend 
we had governin who would have thought the love would end 
like ice cold albums all good things 
never thought wed sing the same song that all hoods sing 
thought it was all wood grain all good brain 
we wouldnt bicker like the other fools talk good game 
never imagine all of the disaster that one could bring 
could bring should blame the game and i could 
its kill or be killed how could i refrain 
forever be in debt and thats never a good thing 
the pressure of success can put a good strain 
on a friend you call best and yes it could bring 
out of the worst in every person even the good saint 
but though we rehearsed it it just aint tha same 
when ya put in the game at age sixteen 
then you mix things like cars jewelry and this thing 
jealously ego and pride and this brings 
it all to a head like a coin chit ching 
the root of all evil strikes again this could sting 
now the team got beef between the post and the point 
this puts the ring in jeopardy it definitely

i feel like a black republicanmoney i got comin in 
cant turn my back on the hood i got love for em 
cant clean my act up for good too much thug in em 
prolly in the back of the hood im like fuck it then

cant turn my back on the hood too much love em

probly end up back in the hood im like fuck it then 

im back in the hood theyre like hey nas 
blowin on purp reflecting on they lives 
couple of fat cats couple of a is 
dreamin of fly shit instead of the grey skies 
gray 5s hate eyes wishin our reign dies 
pitch sling pies and niggaz they sing why 
guess they aint strong enough to handle their jailtime 
weak minds keep tryin follow the street signs 
im standing on the roof of my building 
im feeling the whirlwind of beef i inhale in 
just like an acrobat ready to hurl myself through the hoops of fire 
sippin 80 proof bulletproof under my attire 
could it be the forces of darkness against hood angels of good that form street politics 
makes a sweet honest kid turn to illegal for commerce to get his feet out of them conversethats my word 

i feel like a black republicanmoney keep comin in 
cant turn my back on the hood i got love for em 
cant clean my act up for good too much thug in em 
prolly in the back of the hood i fuck it then

first thing that happen when you make a little paper
you think the marriot is livin in a skyscraper
till you come across some even more flyer paper
realize that five-star tellies are even greater
terry-cloth robes elegance movie shit
heated-up marble floors with jacausezis in it
first-class flights diamonds in your crucifixes

how they sell blacks to bootleg shit infact
real millionaires spend 60 mil on paintings
whores charge niggas with raping
cause we come out doors of maybach cars
watch us make bets on race tracks smokin cigars
so they counter the laws to take whats ours
bout 500k on a lawyer to beat the charge
so you cant stop us from making a billion dollars

to a world of entrapment a good girl gone backwards

donny hathaway freefall from a balcony he sways

[verse 2] 
sam trusted womack with his main lady he tossin in the grave like this is how you repay me 
a change goin come wish you didnt trust me so much 
marvin said no mountains high enough fly stuff 
david ruffin was punchin tammy tyrell gave her concussions 
while the funk brothers was layin down the percussions 
when flow from the supremes died diana ross cried 
many people said that she was laughing inside why 

[chorus] 
as a blunt ash falls into the ashtray i can see my whole life fly past me

[verse 3] 
john f kennedys enemies dealt with treachery it interests me 
julie campbell in gucci sandals shes what a temptress be 
the death of anis cosby what a mystery 
all of chicago and herald washington someone is sabotagin him 
watch out for the traps larry troutman killed his brother roger troutman then he killed himself thats the end of zat 
and i wouldnt change a thing mistakes of the greats 
this is what came from they pain from they hurt we gain an unfair exchange

let there be light 
no gangbanging in new york tonight 
just murals of biggie smalls bigger than life 
turn up the kid mic because yall aint listening right 
whats all this talk that nas got brought
id rather outline my body in white chalk 
aint nobody been where i been they at standstill 
this is all overseen by my man will 

hook 
as i walk through the valley of shadow of death
i know that i aint got much time left
and they dont really wanna see the good in me
aint satisfied until they see the fool in me
 and all my business all my sin is straight 
and thank the hood for all the love they gave
 forgive em all for all they did their best to hate 
ohhh let their be light

verse 2
this aint to glorify just painting a street picture 
theres no goddess or bibles just blunts and swishers
gillettes cut caine in the kitchen
now every rapper wanna claim he hang with kenneth supreme griffin
its like the same difference except when niggas get arranged 
they dont want the same sentence niggas get to snitching 
if i could reverse the minds and turn falls to rises and bring back niggas who livest 
old hustlers reminiscing on better days they home 
doing nothing might as well be in a cage 


hating on young brothers one foot in the grave 
they used to love us until we found our own way through the maze 
new york set trippin and flagging west coast laughing 
now escos asking what happened 
my home girl from upper manhattan she remembers the quarters thats latin
a lot of rat-a-tat-tatting 

hook 

verse 3
the son of the audio cassette era tech wearer 
bullets and burgettes benz bo speak a terror 
demand i get mine till im dead so i can drop something red 
like that horse standing on its hind legs 
since arnold and willis in there bunk beds
i went and bread like wonder 
not ned the wineo like the parents of lionel 
nas is the ghetto american idol 
no matter what you do your never getting my title 
i cant sound smart because youll run away 
they say i aint hungry no more and i dont talk about yay 
like theres no other way for an ex hustler cake getter
ex rich splitter to touch ya 
i beg to differ
when your fours years in the game we can have a conversation 
eight years in the game ill invite you on vacation 
ten years in the game
after ive enjoyed my fame
only then ill let you pick my brain 
niggas[verse 1 nas] 
uh light somethin stop frontin
how much moneys enough think maybe like the trillion figures
pray my daughter dont wild like the hilton sisters
thatd kill me yo filthy rich
my daughter pass it on to the next generation
throwing carnations at my tombstone
in my new home
meet moms in my yves st laurent suit on
then we do a dance like my man luther jam
but my verse came first
i stole change out her purse
now i wanna dig her up outta the earth
too morbid lean forward toward a new paragraph
blue carats d-class
strictly that cush in the weed bag
tryna figure out what berry gordy had put in production
studio smoky now hard like david ruffin
hit a spliff through a séance and i play on playa

[hook snoop dogg] 
finest females i spit game on i sprayed her
gotta get your papes on play on playa
before its all gone sip dom tip waiters
do the yacht thing ménage swing baby
spendin dubs on your buzz gotta live crazy
finest females i spit game on i sprayed her
get your papes on play on playa
get your papes on play on playa
get your papes on

[verse 2 nas] 
ruby red grapefruit juice with grey goose
rubies in hey-zeus piece
pimped out like snoop be but an east coast thing
my girl stock-ing tied up in a knot top of my bean head
billion dollar dream hear
went from triple beams to digital
serving fiends the minimal
60 gs no criminal
no mo just mo doe
mimosas pouring oprahs earrings on fingers
while your girl performs cunnilingus
cause this big money aroma lingers
barber cleans his blade then he give me a fade
hot towel on the face
hot models who vomit after they eat so they can stay lightweight
swallowing my protein like an ovaltine shake
come through like moe green from godfather so clean


where i step i clorox it
keep 20 gs on both sides of the thighs thats four pockets
eighty thousand browse for the nicest price
but we aint into buying conflict ice
thats the shit they stole from the congo and other black soil
true mack for you
nappy hair just spinnin
honey gave me a massage with the happy ending
finest females i just came on and sprayed her
gotta get your papes on play on playa
[hook snoop dogg]
finest females i spit game on i sprayed her
gotta get your papes on play on playa
before its all gone sip dom tip waiters
do the yacht thing ménage swing baby
spendin dubs on your buzz gotta live crazy
finest females i spit game on i sprayed her
get your papes on play on playa

[verse 3 snoop dogg] 
its kinda hard for a playa like you
but let me show you how a nigga like me get revenue
what you never do

never let the game get ahead of you
get a better view
better yet a better crew
praise god ima marry you
get your homie carry you bury you
slowly roll me another blunt stuff it
lick it puff it tuck it - fuck it
that man that gang that bang it was

right before he blast all you heard was two clicks blaw
end of existence for instance
rewind it replay it re-chop it remix it
re-twist it god damn d-o double g cause we missed it

ladahdah be dahdadah

the king from queens mr escobar
connect with the best from the west yes yes ya are
oh my god its snoop dogg and nas
playa play onnas
there comes a day in your life
when you want to kick back
straw hat on the porch
when you old perhaps
want to gather your thoughts
have a cold one brag
to your grand kids on how life is golden
so ima light a cigar in the corridor of the crib
pictures on the wall of all the things that i did
all the money and fame 8 by 10s
of the whole rap pack inside of a big frame
colliding with big names that couldve made you career stop
all that and your man is still here and im still hot
wow i need a moment yall see i almost felt a tear drop

when was the last time you heard real anthem
nas the millionaire the mansion
when was the last time you heard your boy nas rhyme
never on schedule but always on time

chrisette michele
these streets hold my deepest days
this hood taught me golden ways
made me truly this is what made me
break me not a things gonna break me
these streets hold my deepest days
this hood taught me golden ways
made me truly this is what made me
break me not a things gonna break me
oh im that history im that block
im that lifestyle im that that spot

thats my past that made me hot
heres my lifelong anthem
cant forget about you cant forget about you

nas
cant forget about the old school
bam cas mel lie mel flash 
rocks steady spinning on they back
cant forget when the first rap grammy when to jazzy
fresh prince fat boys broke up
rap hasnt been the same since
so irregular how it mess you up when mr t became a wrestler
cant forget about jordans retirement
the shot robert horry hit to win the game in the finals kid
some things are forever some things are not
its the things we remember that gave the world shock
they stay in a place in your mind so snug
like who the person was with whom you first made love

when was the last time you heard real anthem
nas the millionaire the mansion
when was the last time you heard your boy nas rhyme
never on schedule but always on time

chrisette michele
these streets hold my deepest days
this hood taught me golden ways
made me truly this is what made me

nas
unforgettable unsubmittable i go by n now just one syllable
its the n cuz the game tied is the same vibe
good times had right after james died
thats why the gangsta rhymers aint inspired
heinous crimes help records sells more than creative lines
and i dont want to keep bringing up the greater times
but im dreamer nostalgic with the state of mind
the past the past enough of it aight then
nothing gives me chills like douglas and tyson
or mike when his talk was live
or when he first did the moon walk on motowns 25

when was the last time you heard real anthem
nas the millionaire the mansion
when was the last time you heard your boy nas rhyme
never on schedule but always on time

chrisette michele
these streets hold my deepest days
this hood taught me golden ways
made me truly this is what made me
break me not a things gonna break me
these streets hold my deepest days
this hood taught me golden ways
made me truly this is what made me
break me not a things gonna break me

thats why darling its incredible
that someone so unforgettable	
thinks that im unforgettable too[nas]

i love cape cod and watching fly bitches with gray eyes 
wrestle in a tub of ky to get my day by 
i like to celebrate why cause i can vision 
collages of images of my lives with no regrets or hate 
so every breath i take is all about the rules 
its hard for you to breath like you at high altitude 
so crack the patrone its own heavens 
the gods back hard body mr jones never leavin

ghetto niggaz struttin with nothin but dreams and queens broke 
mack-10s you can smell the pcp smoke 
mele mel told it real in the music he wrote 
those were the days i remember 
we used to be close then i was nine coldest winter i remember 
was slippin in december two feet of snow 
yeah thats the east coast that black ice 
symbolized the rap life 
it was slick and smooth 
i understood i had to come from the hood 
doin the pee wee herman the smurf 
before them phones chirped 
the blocks drugs flowin didnt have your own work 
you had to have somebody elses a small chrome on your pelvis 
starter jacket blue georgetown or green celtic 
your girls too expensive she wants shellfish 
red lobster was poppin standin on that line forever 
i wish somebody would step on my bally leathers 
now its whatever hip-hops forever 
kept my radio on 98 or bls 
had a pre-pubescent lyric gift but niggaz never hear me spit 
my little brother tried to warn em i was a tornado comin 
he knew from inside like the eye of a storm 
and told my pops about it 
he gave us tickets to that wild style flick 
double trouble retarded we was the proudest 
i never had a summer job 
sweepin leaves socks to my knees 
homemade shorts cutoff lees 
i aint work a day in my life 
wipin away eraser of the paper man 
im just tryin to say it right 
big radio tape slowin down 
lower the lights go battery dead 
i gotta freeze em til they ice cold 
in the freezer later im starin at the speaker 
sunk in them 808s deeper cleanin my sneakers 
wit the bristles of a toothbrush soap and water 
i let the shoe strings soak in water

they dug me out the soil in the mines of the motherland
now im misplaced one hand to another hand
illegal smugglin people strugglin
wish they could just throw me back in the mud again
yeah guess thats how we got here
slave trade then the diamond trade
every childs afraid
when his mother and father get sprayed
forced in the army young killer brigade
gets a new name and then he give his nose glue
til his mind cant take what hes gon through
lookin in that dirt for that ice so blue
then the royal family the ice goes to
and this thing has to change feelin half-ashamed
as i rap with my platinum chain
when you shop for a gift for me
you think about the misery
the same way we made apartheid history
we can do the same thing to the conflict ice
but everybody wanna shine right

[hook nas]
everybody wants heaven but nobody wants dead
everybody wants diamonds without the bloodshed

[verse 2 nas]
my vvs glimmers on my chest
200-thou-encrusted watch on my wrist
i wonder how people starve to death
when god bless the land that lacks the harvest
the stones equality but they homes are poverty
and the whole world ignores the robbery
bought my girl pretty rocks when shes mad at me
tear-drop shaped uh perfect clarity
it shocks so many are killed annually
cause of greed lust and pure vanity
stop talkin and do somethin about it
every holiday season jewelry stores crowded
kids snatched from their homes mutilated alive
husbands separated from wives keep a jesus piece to be fly
but back in the day there was a time when they called us shine

[hook nas]
everybody wants heaven but nobody wants dead
everybody wants diamonds without the bloodshed
everybody wants heaven but nobody wants dead
everybody wants diamonds without the bloodshed
they wanna shine on em

caked up trying to take what im eatin
came up a dismissive kid
you lucky if you allowed to witness this
savvy mouth while hardly a mans man
who woulda knew the beach houses and wild parties
jezebels and stella mccartneys
for years all that how can i not be dead
this old german said i was a thug with a knotty head
looked at my benz and called that a nazi sled
with a face like he wondered where i got my bread
probably all the stones he see from my shows overseas

we were scholars long before colleges
they say we n-i-double-g-e-r we are

the obvious we are the slave and the master
what you lookin for you the question and the answer

we trust no black leaders use the stove to heat us
powdered eggs and government cheeses
the calendars with martin jfk and jesus
gotta be fresh to go to school with fly sneakers
schools with outdated books we are the forgotten
summers coolin off by the fire hydrant
yeah im from the ghetto
where old black women talk about their sugar level - its not unusual
to see photos of dead homies funerals
aluminum foil on tv antennas
little tv sit on top the big tv eating tv dinners
girls dye their hair with kool-aid
they gave us lemons we made lemonade
but this niggers payed ancestry of slaves
descendant of kings its necessary i - bling
put rims on everything where timbs on every scene

they say we n-i-double-g-e-r we are
much more still we choose to ignore
the obvious man this history dont acknowledge us
we were scholars long before colleges
they say we n-i-double-g-e-r we are

the obvious we are the slave and the master
what you lookin for you the question and the answer

do i mean it like a slave master nigger
no im gangsta gotta eat rappers
my abbreviation was young when i caught the cases
that should mean the court could see my changes take off the bracelets
savers went broke smokes our diesel need no bowflex
my chest still cut up like a bag of dope
thought patterns consist of boss matters
spit moses lost commandments like a growth sandwich out my mouth
toast to government cameras peepin us every week i must
have my cars homes and phones squeaked for bugs
but this is what i was dreamin of
between cuttin hard coke with new razors slicin my fingers up
they used to string us up we wanted everything
but the one bringin us cake be the snakes like the

so now my enemies are at my front door
cause anytime we mention our condition our history or existence
they callin it reverse racism
still to this day the streets torn - my brother jung
ill always have a seat for him - not behind me beside me
youll always know where to find me
they say the close ones will hurt you
so lets keep a small circle
on the road to riches and diamond rings
in the land of the blind the man with one eye is the king

they did not have the power to stop louis farrakhan
they were trying to touch on and thieve envy within the leadership
but as a general and a man that rose through the ranks through discipline
his presence inspired those men with the discipline he imposed on his own life

no revolutionary gets old or so im told

wondering who plotting to get me
alphabet boys still plotting against me
to hush me and stuff me in the pockets of history

when time go by youll soon forget me
they say he was the king of bling jewels and bentleys
then i use one of my lines just to prove im guilty
dont let em kill me

verse 1 nas

mmm fried chicken
fly vixen
give me
heart disease
but need
you in my kitchen
you a bird but you aint a key
got wings but you cant fly away from me
driving in your bucket seats
all the way from kentucky
to f**k with me
look what you done to me
was number one to me
after you shower
you and your gold medal flour
then you rub on with hot oil for half an hour
you in your hot tub im looking at you salivating
dry you off i got your paper towel waiting
lay you down cause youre red hot
louisiana style you make my head rot
then i flock
to the bed then plop
when we done i need rest
dont know a part of you that i love best
your legs or your breast
misses fried chicken you gon be a nigga death
created by southern black women
to serve massa guest
you gon be a nigga death
misses fried chicken
you was my addiction
dripping with high cholest
like greeks with his falafel
or italians with his to-mato
pasta
or roti is to a rasta
trapping me
you and your friend mac and cheese
candy yams collard greens
but you knocking me to my knees
its killing me when i miss ah
nothing i need more than a fish fry

verse 2 busta rhymes

shit it taste good i cant lie
its like youre walking out a tanning saloon
when i pull you out the oven from baking i got you on my mind
rubbing that sun tan lotion all up over your body
so amazing how you sparkle when i glaze you swine
hey my pretty hand hot its so feminine
the way you submitted
and how you gave me power
to massaging me to shower
you with lemon water
marinate you with season you dipping you in chowder
baby
its like you at the spa
the way you gently
lay in the pan
while you enjoying you butter milk treatment
i sit and watch the grease sizzle bubbling
on your skin
despite the funny fragrance
still i lick my finger frequent
in any event
im reflecting on all the signs saying that i got i shouldnt f**k with you
but the way you taste made it hard to resist when i put my mouth on you
but thats another issue
butterflies up in my stomach when i laid eyes on you
was it infection manifesting
confused over the feeling impatiently eating you
intestinal worm chewing on the walls of my intestine
ima eat you until theres nothing left
til my very last breath
you gon be a nigga death
despite your good appearance
cooking swine as a chef
you gon be a nigga death
who cares if the swine
is mixed with rat cat and dog combined
yes i eat the shit to death

outro busta rhymes

aint that some shit
ima eat some shit
until what im eating kills me

and i choose to do that
why
cause thats just what niggas doman talking
it is absolutely silly and unproductive to have a funeral for the word nigger when the actions continue we need to have a movement to resurrect brothers and sisters not a funeral for niggers cause niggers dont die


verse 1 [nas]
ugh yeah yo im creepy and crawling
in your sink and your toilet
ill be drinking from your spit
anything cause im more less an insect with 4 legs
people come and i fake dead
correction i got 8 legs
climbin on top your plate bed
where ever i smell food
it could even be jail food
stale food thats molded
a roach is what i am fool
the ghetto is my land fool
im a never be able to fly like a bumblebee
[project roach lyrics on http//wwwelyricsworldcom/ ]
try not to be underneath
your sneaker
pitiful creature
im not afraid of your pesticide
or raid
cause in heavens my creator
i love it when the lights off
eating from same knives forks
from any mans dinner
see my antennas
you cant win
you cant stand the crunchy sound i make if you squash me
learn to live with me
how much your roast  costing
you and the city
but yo we everywhere
check your house cause i bet we thereverse 1
find a room to lock yourself in and close the door
its some heavy concepts that we gotta explore
we gotta strip the word down rugged and raw
the rhetoric of martin king just aint around no more
dave bowie aint here james baldwin neither
they all were leaders
but they aint help me get this porcsh two seater
a lawyer left the hood he never looked back
to be a fortune 500 ceo it took rap
so what if my pants sag with my hat turned back
the same swag got our merchandise flying off the rack
marketing companies thats hiring blacks
fresh hip hop lingo for your campaign ads
the controversy surrounds who could say it and win
some niggas are full time some play and pretend
so fuck that no apologies on the issue
if it offends you
its meant to
its that simple

you could still feel chills from the team
on 118 my nigga ben fly by like its a dream

laced in a pinky ring in his black benz murking

and some accident murderers they act like they killed on purpose
liars brag they put work in
you aint mean to murk him your guns a virgin
better stay on point if not its curtains
bebo posse reincarnated through me probably
if music money didnt stop me
i never claimed to be the toughest
though im to blame for a few faces reconstructed
its the game that we was stuck with
now im the only black in the club with rich yuppie kids
sad thing this is the top but where the hustlers went
no familiar faces around aint gotta grab the musket
its all safe and sound champagne by the bucket
where them niggas i shouted out on my first shit

verse 1 nas
you cocked back
you thought you had it planned you thought you had your man
he saw you comin he ran when you tried to blast that man
you missed him by inches he sprinted
some of his boys on the corner was who your bullets entered
two of em pull through but one didnt sons finished
you took the life of him
the part about it thats crazy you was aiight with him
tight with him why was he in the way
why was he standin next to the enemy that specific day
his style never hollas loud stays reclusive
good dude got that look like he always about to do shit
side of his mouth toothpick one eyebrow raised
got into it with dude who still tried to live out his old wild out days
they never had no probs
somehow they rubbed each other wrong like a bad massage
these two different personalities had to collide
niggas could not aim and innocent niggas died
you ask why cause of a

hook- nas
accident murderer act like you killed on purpose
liars brag you put work in
you aint mean to murk him your guns a virgin
streets are full of them read the bulletin

how could i not protect her from this awful phase
never tried to hide who i was she was taught and raised like
a princess but while im on stage i cant leave her defenseless
plus shes seen me switching women pops was on some pimp shit
she heard stories of her daddy thuggin
so if her husband is a gangster cant be mad i love her
never for her i want better homie in jail- dead that
wait till he come home you can see where his heads at
niggas got game they be tryna live
he seen your mama crib plus im sure he know who your father is
although you real plus a honest kid
dont think im slow i know you probably had that chronic lit

shes on twitter i know she aint gon post no pic
of herself underdressed no inappropriate shit right
her mother cried when she answered
said she dont know what got inside this childs mind she planted
a box of condoms on her dresser then she instagrammed it
at this point i realized i aint the strictest parent
im too loose im too cool with her
shoulda drove on time to school with her
i thought i dropped enough jewels on her
took her from private school so she can get a balance
to public school they too nurture teen talents
they grow fast
one day shes ya little princess next day she talking boy business

they say the coolest playas and foulest heart breakers in the world
god gets us back he makes us have precious little girls

when she date we wait behind the door with the sawed off

this kind of love is a once in a lifetime cruise
reach out and touch the love that i have for you
i see you standing there so lost and all alone
i wanna take you in my arms
and tell you that youre home
i look into your eyes
i said i know you very well
i see a mirror of my life
a reflection of myself

verse 1 nas
345 am cant sleep cant dream
im stuck money problems pop up
how will i survive guess its best to decide not to decide
so thats my decision
whatever happens happens
i keep makin my millions
can see myself in presidential campaign dinners
but im gassin blunts around a bunch of gang members
when youre too hood to be in them hollywood circles
and youre too rich to be in that hood that birthed you
and you become better than legends you thought were the greatest
and out grow women you love and thought you could stay with
life become clearer when you wipe down your mirror
and leave notes around for yourself to remember
i like to teach and build
with brothers about how easy it is to reach a mill
all you need is some skill then its grindtime
imagination better than knowledge says einstein
its all in the mind
nasty the nicest im somewhat of a psychic
just one minute after its heard
you all excited you all repeat it
so call me a genius if you didnt
now that i said it i force you to think it
write in my little vignettes sipping moet
when you vision me you vision the best
when i was young they called me olus son
now he nas father i was the good seed
he was the wise gardener

beautiful life often i dream that i can bring my niggas
conservatives dont understand slang linguistics
the burbs talking like the hoodll change with quickness
love the skinny model chicks but i prefer the thickness
so what i rap about my riches and im ostentatious
get out of gangsta business seen in me you basic
try to compare what you live to the life i master
see the fly shit i wear you try to rock it after
big bracelets gold any different faces
white wine spritzers and switzerland on vacation
the strip club scene favors josephine baker
dope fiend neighbours growing up ive seen paper

this is reminiscent to all the parks in the project
when my bread is nice can rival your foamposites
dont make me pull my lottos out the closet

lies and the pain
betrayal; life

[bridge anthony hamilton]
in danger’s face
look what you’re facing gave your heart away
and all the remedies couldn’t ease the pain
all the hurt and betrayal; need to get away
in a world so cold
you gain your life just to lose your soul
never thinking twice bout what the future holds
all the lies and the games not worth fighting for

[refrain anthony hamilton]
the world is an addiction
serving up a fix
the world is an addiction
its way too much for me

[verse 1 nas]
snitches and rapists in the street crime to the fullest
asking niggas if they got any extra nine bullets
they deny me that
they know the bullets they loan me
be the same ones that probably had them lying flat stretched out

its better to dead a beef than let it breathe
then we dont succeed
cause then you gotta murder dummies
waste your time they allergic to money
im never squirmish to blood
we can thug and get out of hand
what’s the options
only conclusion is shooting
bullets popping hoodlums dropping
fear any day that the feds will come knocking
was young and nervous
asking myself what’s my purpose
in the back of a paddy wagon bracelets aching me
pigs ignoring im asking what precinct they taking me
these cops can’t relate to me
death to prison empty vacancy

[refrain]

[verse 2 nas]
thou shall not be selfish real nigga commandments
know a billionaire he has everything but a fam
guess how angry this man gets
had so many bad chicks in his bed
strange sex same sex
has addictions that are sadistic
chain of events habits
he puts cocaine on his prick and acts sick
self-esteem needs boosting alcohol consumption
nicotine fusion some athletes juicing
pastors quote biblical chapters psalms
all along he’s into bestiality porn
and it’s wrong so i keep the cali weed in the bong
and im strong but the female anatomy got me sprung
and these women need shoes and baddest cars and condos
fine clothes and these fiends needs to get high so they find dough
to mainline dope and yall know

[refrain]

[verse 3 nas]
so many vices habits
mine of course bad chicks
my response to any advice on what is the essentials of life
im just rebellious not selfish
guess we all share different definitions of what wealth is
i need the best things in life thats women that’s cars cigars
a vintage bottle on ice that’s priceless
the other night just in the emergency room
a patient said she needs to see a doctor soon
doctor busy operating on a lady whos sedated
he can barely concentrate cause he’s newly separated
his estranged wife likes entertaining her acquaintance
in the house they were married in mad people waiting
some young some old heads and stomachs aching
filling out an application cause they all need medication
but the doctor need love or a quick vacation
calling up his travel agent
same time premedidating murdering his ex wife
life savage aint it
some need xanax just to maintain it
we all need faith cause the world keep changing
let go of the illusion start some restraining

everything to go to your spouse when you end your vows

body language is off he’s soft
but soft niggas all a sudden start dumping fronting
cause he feel a way
my niggas say the eyes is a giveaway
one look could tell me if you really came to kill me
be the quiet nigga looking
laying with the milli
who that over there creeping
who homie by the tree

few machine guns close we could squeeze all three
be a cold day in hell fore they creep on me

it’s been so long
can’t remember how we begun this war
this is a ever-lasting thunderstorm
cause guns went off
i see your moms she still speak
she don’t know i ain’t cool with her son no more
it’s old shit see forever we holding this grudge
takes real men to squash beef
end it with hugs
we buried our dead been years
why should i worry bout him
constantly watching my back
plus niggas telling i dread
another day i put a family in black
though i be calm and relaxed
though i know somehow it will come back
even if i’m in the right
cause still a life is a life
what was it worth to see you covered in dirt
it’s quite redundant
whether you the hunter or the hunted
mother’s cry no statute of limitation on a homicide
just tattoos of my niggas’ names
i wonder will it change
let’s ride

[verse 3]
it’s rare i listen to niggas who never been in my position
a caterpillar can’t relate to what an eagle envisions
from the mind of a man who went at it with killers
sit down little man
let me school you in hood business
seen a lotta niggas blow
lotta dreams folded
some wasn’t humble ate too much got bloated
ain’t too much left to buy
bought it i’m loaded i guess
lear jets
i ask myself do i need love or success
they say the artist that truly suffers
his stuff is the best
cause his heart bleed on his sleeve
pain pistols and sex
remember spray painting the word fresh and then staring at it
older folks angry pointing swearing at it
buildings i sprayed nowadays drive the mclaren past it
same old man from years ago told me life is short
so from infant to geriatric
trust your own judgment
live with it and love it
