they say my father lives through me so this is just basically how my dad spit
i know my cash come quick when its sunny
you know a girl is special if i stick with her honey
if it wasnt for dummies chick would still have money
and if it wasnt for money nick would still have skummy

so guess its kinda like a gift and a curse

i guess you dont watch the news
you see theres a lot to lose
cuz we got a baby
and people are shady

[bridge drake]
my generation is changin
aside from the fact
the dealers have customers they provide with the crack
front of the buses taken
and we denied from the back
you can die where from or die where you at

[drake chorus]
dont put it past them
i dont think that they understood
my friends they dont even sit in the class when they should
he can come pick you up

[verse drake]
lately i dont know about the friends that i hang with
im nervous round my boys it depends on their anguish
depends on if they saving all the tops on pepsi
with dreams of seeing girls topless on jet skis
depends on what they do to achieve that
robbing r&amp;b singers specially if they know where the keys at
specially if they know where they girl live
get the info leave with ya money man thats how the world is

thats how niggas puttin they dirt down
streets are seedy i call em sesame berkstown
specially when these youngns get turned down for work opportunities
next week same placell get burnt down
coincidink not likely not a chance
how can we be so aware of these problems and not advance
at least start put a bid in its hard just to fit in
a lot of people only play they part when they spittin
but i dont think that they understood
they using this darkness for penetration in the hood
i took the ivory way in and yes im glad that keenan could
not bad meaning bad but bad meaning good good good

not bad meaning bad but bad meaning good

[verse 1 drake]
look
in this world of desperate housewives and freakin players
rappers they tend to be smilin
because they swimmin in women
most of em sick of favors
they come in secret flavors
thats why i envy omar
because so far

and thats some higher learning
trying ta excel with the brake on
ill have you stuck in the same spot
with the tires burnin
and im a liar turnin 19 jaded with no faith
in any female thats askin what i was earnin
i met this recent lady
she knew a piece of sadey by spinners
i guess in my southern eyes that she decent maybe
well second thought if we have it then she can keep the baby
cuz she aint give me the butterflies that aleshia gave me
its like im using some bread to sop up some decent gravy
now im out of both and ive been thinkin of aleshia lately
im all alone i got a feelin its on
cuz nowadays most of the thrill of chillin is gone and uh

[chorus]
loves lost
loves gone
love lost
love is gone

[verse 2 drake]
some dudes they turn purple with hurt faces
circling workplaces
and following girls on the assumptions of what the worst case is
they get to first bases
then they get to retreating cuz if she cheatin
he wanna know what the first trace is
now you like macgyver
cuz you sneakin around
and she dont know that you there when you standin right beside her
i cant relate to that
i had to take it back a couple a years
when some of the best kicked it with drake in fact

i bet that they knew it cuz in my mind i play through it
with [] and they lewis and a couple things that they true in
and in the end i listen but i dont see me as they do
cuz its my opinion my life my potentials for my wife
and i used to be eager to buy em the world
maybe im confused about what i desire from girls
either way im all alone got a feelin its on
cuz nowadays most of the thrill of just chillin is gone and uh

[chorus]
loves lost
loves gone
love lost
love is gone

[verse 3 drake]
check
and nowadays some girls are the type of person that
will tell they friends that they use him which is confusin
since i aint made them a purchase yet
but theres logic behind it
emotions double and they try to cover up
like a mansion with the projects behind it
i tend to freak with this
i get a girl and pretend that i love the spendin
and all she gave was a decent kiss
thinkin she been spoiled
but golddiggin is nothing when you can shovel for days
and come up with tin foil

we could dissect it see
you take a dominique or another freak in the sheets
and you picture that she just slept with me for nothing
gave her nothing
her reputations in jeopardy
cuz it aint take her 3 of that shopping to get her next to me
collectively i look for a proper chick thatll rep for me
instead of seeing something she wants and callin and textin me
for thinkin that exists i got a feeling im wrong
nowadays most of the thrill of just chillin is gone and uh

[chorus]
loves lost
loves gone
love lost
love is gone[chorus]
look
if you a girl with the aspirations
of being in the background witcha asses shakin
hittin clubs and skippin out on the class you takin

steady lightin cigars at the parties they sneak in
and look forward to being a star on the weekend
ya are part of the speech coz

[verse 1 drake]
im from the city where people be gettin lazy
litterin in the streets
and the club district is poppin like literally every week
and promotersll push flyers
money exchange hands
liars sell you they dreams
and dummies exchange plans
hustlers give you events
bouncers give you pass
directors give em a shot
so girlsll give up the ass

and groupies that would flock to hometown athletes
and start rolling together like snoopy and woodstock
daffy and bugs its all laughing and hugs
til the dude catch a plane
and she back where she was
right back on the bus
its ashame cuz now at his rental
she throwin bricks like shaq in the clutch
you can see thats shes colder
cuz he doesnt hold her
fall flat on the ground trying ta lean on his shoulder
know that he tried ta told her
that he couldnt mold her
if this the type of chick you wanna be when you older i say

[chorus]
if you a girl with the aspirations
of being in the background witcha asses shakin
hittin clubs and skippin out on the class you takin
i ask you to have some patience

[verse 2 drake]
now up north theres five artists deservin a listen
and im one of em the other four you know who you are
but if you gotta think through
chances are that it aint you
i singlehandedly carry out what you cant do
and see i take a couple of breathers
and then things come together on the spot like a couple thats eager
if you wanna pack a duffel and leave her
go ahead i couldnt give two damns like a couple of beavers
but uh the in &amp; the out
[]
whenever im out in memphis the man seen as trill
and every verse the man seem to kill
you can find him with black jays and socks like im andreena mill
japan and brazil the audience acreaming
and then you come around and all the fans seems to chill
advances to deals financing appeals
the hustles i have you feeling like you dancing in heels and uh

[chorus]
if you a girl with the aspirations
of being in the background witcha asses shakin

uh yea get in my slick rick mode
na mean im a tell ya a story real quick

[verse 1 drake]
look
she got a saying theres no alice without the tin man
crib was 2 mil plus i just bought a couch for ten grand
even if the house was ten grand
and there was no pool
would i still be witout my swim fan
the ceiling could be higher
she making requests
dont know if she feeling me or she be feelin what i buy her
and purses are light now
she use em all the time
so she smilin to the the point that it hurt when she bite down
and she simply a new model
stay spendin dollars
but she got less sense than a empty perfume bottle
at times she a solid chick
and im a sucka for the cuties
so she always lookin good when my wallets thick
chillin on the linen she all up in the closet so much
got a hunch thats shes feelin other women
want the diamonds on the face in the center
nice guys finish last so im winnin every race that i enter and she a

[chorus]
video girl
eh yo you have to listen
im in a bad position
i fell in love with a
video girl
i wouldnt call her name
i got the feelin that they all the same

and she a
video girl
to the fullest extent
so i wrote you a song
cuz i cant stay with a
video girl
and you betrayed your wealth
got a feelin you shoulda stayed yourself

[verse 2 drake]
youre all the same
look at vida guerrera
theres no need to compare her
i bet she smiles cuz she loves what she sees in the mirror
i bet shes out meetin directors instead
and frustratrated cuz shes already been addressed in they head
be a teacher open up shop if you can do nails fine
apply for a business loan and ill bet you that theyll sign
if you a real dime
poppin as if its your only option
girl theres things to do
other than jail time
look this aint a song dissing half of these rappers
or pasha and sasha esther baxter
melyssa ford or katy or anyone after
i just give my opinion for laughter
or maybe to think on
so next time you out at the club
and a brother offers the whole table something to drink on
you just take in effect he got a stack with a mink on
now he got you doing everything that you think wrong
look you tell your parents that its cash at an easy pace
ya dad screaming take ya ass outta jeezy face
and as ya man i wont back down first
but they got you doing soft-core background work
that messed up like an officer that pulls you over
and he ask questions later and pat down first
but you aint thandie newton and this aint crash here
the resolutions passed baby this aint last year
look i got a message ill say it
i got some beats still
regina hall and garcelle and alice neal
young girls these here women with big dreams
role models that you can watch on the big screen
if you refuse to change and you that chick still
respect yourself dont be convinced that these tricks will
you got an audience believe it or not
my cousin who cant speak know the lyrics to tip drill

[chorus]
video girl
eh yo you have to listen
im in a bad position
i fell in love with a
video girl
i wouldnt call her name
i got the feelin that they all the same
and she a
video girl
to the fullest extent
so i wrote you a song
cuz i cant stay with a
video girl
and you betrayed your wealth
got a feelin you shoulda stayed yourself

[drake speaking]
and i aint trying ta generalize every video girl you na mean 
say that ya all one way man its just that sometimes man you gotta 
accept the fact that theres times that you gotta better yourself 
you know as a person man i love to see my black women strong single 
independent doing they thing without popping they booty in some rappers 
video you na mean its a wonderful thing baby so uh dont hate me for
this one ladies just take my advice you na mean cuz its like uh
if she beautiful and honey dances
and you always downtown making money transfers
and anything the color of braces she get excited
she always showing up at these places she get invited
she a video girl[talking]
yeah this dedicated to canada man
the whole up north
a lot of people dont realize how cold it gets during the winter
but listen

[verse 1]
i met this new girl late june or early july
i called her a bunch of times but she barely replied
now its december im driving and shes like wheres my hi
i swear that i never called you cause i really get shy
see that was a segue i believe the matter
is what happens after the seaon where the leaves just scatter
where the timb laces get tighter and parka hoods flip up
drugs dealers standin and they parka hoods slip up
where girls become exes from summers caught hoin
the winter cars come out the summer cars go in
and some places is breezy and some it start snow-ing
and if you planning family vacations you better know when
but some mothers scared to send they daughters out the city
instead she get a sweater that she bought her out of pity
cause mom stays up late she seen them videos
where cancun college students pouring water on their titties

[talking over chorus]
yeah man its a funny thing going through the winter up here man
a lot of girls yknow wanna get close you might think they the one
but just wait nah mean take it slow

[verse 2]
forget to mention this girl that never gets to the beach
she lives just west of my street and so we destined to meet
since im driving i ask her how to get the suite
she doesnt answer opens the door and just gets in the seat
she throws her bag in the back and starts adjusting the heat
shes bold but i roll with it im impressed cause shes sweet
then she says i heard your song and im obsessed with the beat
i mean the lyrics are good but im obsessed with the beat
i love it when voyce sings and the chorus is good
theres a couple things in the song that i suggest you repeat
off this im kinda takin it back for a second 
i get her number she tells me to call her after this session
and so i do and its kind of awkward the surface hard to scratch
until we end up sexin and now my heart attached
im thinkin off i shouldve been more southern
and realizing all that she wanted was that indoor lovin and ho

[talking over chorus]
yeah uh i told yall i had a story for you right
uh ya man its what it is

[verse 3]
and now im proud to have her like montreal to the frizzench
she love to play hurt like carter did on the bizzench
but my boy say im actin different because i lay downtown
and i still i rush to pick her up from work and fizzench
she tellin everyone imma hold here down
tell everyone im the prince up in this cold clear town
and stupid me i just listen to her 
instead of wondering if this is really gon last me the whole year round
but then spring shows up and its dallas in this bitch
the weather starts to resemble the holidays she missed
when we were together it seeming like way back when
ball players hop on the plane and make it way back in
see she used to play piana and now she never wait for santa
instead of saving for marriage she saving for carrabanna
and its a shame she had me convinced that she couldve been a dime
i guess i lost another one to the wintertime

[voice + drake]
i miss you most of aaaallll myy daarling [beat fades out]
gimme a second to gather my toughts
[fades back in] strolling in the park ho
and watching winter turn to spriing such a beautiful day man
yeah man you know we had to switch it on em right
strolling in the park and watching winter turn to spriing
im still standing on two feet even after this tragic loss
man but i got something to else to tell ya baby

[rap]
i remember them encore pms breakfast and the wake up
now drakes committed we waiting on the breakup
so we can get back to them cognac nights 
with dress codes and light skinned girls that wont act right
and i laugh cause my previous lifestyle was quite wild
the winter came and blew his cold air through
back then light sweaters and a couple drinks might get her 
by the end of the week i would know that crew
and wed assembled a trio a whole new scene
with three ladies in the shot we never broke routine
at the end of every cut when the cameras are rollin
we had ladies hearts always gettin damaged and stolen
but this summer is different its a two man operation
granted the fact that we one man short
got love for him he can watch this new man stop a nation
cause handin them crack is a one man sport
instead of dress-up i walk in sweat pants and chomp clinkin
i find a girl we step dance and calm drinkin
the face the breast the bras the toes
im still solo and a long night draws to a close
cause its a fact if she come to the crib and i get some ass inside
well never talk again scary and true 
that song special i recorded with voyce well its like a classified
its what im lookin for to carry me through
yet i cant seem to find a heavy girl that possesses it
only wants a friendship causing me to forget the shit
and when they talk about they past and lovers
and you get mad at the though of it giving ass to others
yet you find peace with yourself now least theres some room to ride
theres also room for improvement as soon as june arrive

[voice]
strolling in the park and watching winter turn to spriing
strolling in the park and watching winter turn to spriing
strolling in the park and watching winter turn to spriingsouthern smoke

[speaking]
yeah ho 
its drake uh uh ho
do that dance do that dance

[chorus]
you special girl dont leave me baby
to find another just like you wont be easy baby
so at least i know where the ones at
baby just promise me if you go that youll come back

[verse 1]
look i ought to be thankful because for women i have plenty of love
and when it comes to relationships many is stuck
look at 50 you make love 30 you have sex
somewhere around the tender age of 20 you fuck
or maybe before im here waiting to score
its long gone like brothers having a tape in their car
instead these girls taking it raw
now they tell you to do whatever you want because its safe to explore
forget wait till its right now wait till its more 
wait till he get gets a deal girl wait till the tour
so they dance to attract me advance and attack me
to the point that drake compare me to anthony mackie
but once they have my pants and my khakis
i tell them im not one for commitment and romancing exactly
because i hate waking up undressed with a dame
and guessing her name i hope this shit is destined to change

[chorus x2]
because you special girl dont leave me baby
to find another just like you wont be easy baby
so at least i know where the ones at
baby just promise me if you go that youll come back

[verse 2]
i dont get it its like my fairy was sick
its like i meet the perfect girl and she put me through some various shit
its something that i can rarely predict
all i know is that i can never find the love that tyler perry depict
im guessing maybe shemar moore isnt really all pure
maybe i lie to myself and its like a small cure
i tell it all to her
i gotta feeling this feeling inside is something its like and cant be all sure
because really what is a window without a car door
why i cant settle for one instead of all four
mu mind is clouded this shit complex here
jason tell me ima have a baby by next year
psychic told me ima have three kids
i dont want my daughter making a song like teairra mari did
so ima change yeah this summer is gone
im running along before i raise one of my own

[nickelus f speaking]
niggas in the city hatin me man they trippin
when im the only one thats really spittin
my nigga lil lee the only one thats really grippin
why you deckme up actin like like we cool if you dont feel him nigga

uh im bringing back hip hop
me and my nigga drake
va toronto hip-hop

[verse nickelus f] 
aiight let me take my jacket off
unlace the timbs here again comes the jabberjaw
this time im blabbin on 
these rappers that feel a certain way but they get me yappin off
mad cuz the freestyle iller than they whole catalog
i got the gift like santa claus
flow got spring like a catapult
matter fact the flow supreme like diana ross
im at the do like a deer with the antlers off
niggas acting like scummy was they neega
wouldnt even give my man a 12 bar feature
i know who you are cause he wanted me to eat ya
i said nah lets keep it peaceful
my nigga was a true weed source
he gave it to us for a cheap cost for prices we all could eat off
a real street dog
the type of nigga that yall niggas be studying learning how to get street off
we have an impostor alert the doctor
bout to hit him up with the chopper like blaka
shock em like blanca from street fighter heat got a
hurricane kick murder everything quick
look my new ryu nine is stupendous
why do guys choose my crew to pick wit
my crew lie you guys into ditches
i said it and meant it the scorpios mind has many dimensions
ill say it in intent sentence indent on instant pimpin
hope your listenin to my diction
if you are then you now should be itchin
that its crack we placed in your stereo system
yea i be at your burial trippin
nickelus f from richmond
va 
the scorpios mind is not a game to play wit all day

[verse drake]
ive been hated by many wanted by plenty
disliked by some but confronted by none
since they dont show me sincerity i load up lock up
take shots at em i guess you could call it a parody
but compared to d
they one-fourth from watermelon to a quarter felon dude you a pear to me
if thats not how it is it aint how it appear to be
you got blind heaters in my sweats is a mind reader
and when the psychic get to touchin my palm
seein your physical the things that you never say to me visible
especially when one of your artist feelin threatened
cause im harnessin a weapon wont you pardon my reflection
mirror mirror tell me why they wanna get and scrimmage
to play around to perfection im the spittin image
my verbal camp is vivid i told you im spittin image
it seems we often want to start but never get to finish
my verbal campus is villanova and those of you feelin hova
and writing college rhymes but the thrill is over
let me assist you like a specialist
so you can pull it back and try catch the metaphors and the rest of this
its not a problem wit x i guess im a pessimist
which means if shit goes bad i say i expected this
and me and julien we never got the chance to communicate
instead of understanding its a tune of hate
the citys mine like oklahomas a sooner state
and were gonna have to cross paths whether soon or late
so why dont you walk up in the spot using less strut
you aint morris chestnut you lighter and less cut
and lets be honest by now you should be your own scholar
you still a protege thats the reason i dont holler
you got rappers being repetitive actors
you stay ahead of the game im ahead of the practice boisouthern smoke

[intro drake talking]
yeah ren mof haha 
its drake man its drake manyeah
ayo ren this that gritty shit here man
ima half to tell them about i been through on this know what i mean
ho  southern smoke

[verse 1 drake]
very few give you that truth its either they cant do it with lyrics
or cant do it in spirit they cancel what they doing
the samples that they using cant get through the clearing
ill handle it since they just cant get you to hear it
my fathers early careering forced my parents to split up
my mother was a teacher my father was kind of fed up
with just being a florist the choir sang his chorus
and he got back into doing what he was doing before us
because money is an issue your son he gon miss you
and plus you got a wife at home because mommy still exist too
now you looking for exes you aint never expect this
you end up doing time and me i end up with a step-sis
nobody passing judgment or question where the drugs went
you know i hold you down because without you id be a wasnt
and mommy ima support her i keep it all in order
see her with tears in her eyes or you arrested at the border 
but

[chorus nickelus f]
i got stress on my shoulders
trying to keep my heart pure but this world is making it colder
young black man dodge your bullets trying to get older
and you wonder why we turn to drugs and chain smokers
its stress my nigga
im just trying to live my life cuz
make a little money find a bunny
to make my wife cuz bo bo bo bo
im just trying to live my life cuz
make a little money find a bunny
to make my wife cuz bo bo bo bo

[verse 2 drake]
this is my life and so the rest is kinda been cool question what i been through
i write a verse addressing it and yes i might offend you
picture when i was in school
me being the closest thing to black and guess what rap music what i was into
rest of the kids were sheltered i never liked to fight
but when someone called me a nigger id punch them i couldnt help it
now im grown i can say what it is
its parents that got these black and filipino nannies raising they kids
and your daddy want it very right
i make you happy plus im jewish he dont approve i think he want you to marry white
he want sinatra at the wedding not barry white
because black is black honey even if hes very light
and so i never been for dinner at they places
always brutally honest and so i pin it to they faces
i live it so the case is whether drake is
way ahead of his time or inquisitive and racist

[chorus nickelus f]
i got stress on my shoulders
trying to keep my heart pure but this world is making it colder
young black man dodge your bullets trying to get older
and you wonder why we turn to drugs and chain smokers
its stress my nigga
im just trying to live my life cuz
make a little money find a bunny to make my wife cuz bo bo bo bo
im just trying to live my life cuz
make a little money find a bunny to make my wife cuz bo bo bo bo

[verse 3 drake]
am i hot as the rest should i strive for my spot as the best
like girls with double ds i gotta lot on my chest
theres questions that need to be answered thats not on the test
instead of staring at quizzes  now its models with breasts
and yes when im dismissed after a tedious listen
i sit at home and say i should of been a pediatrician 
homie i probably could of been on tv consistent
an artist like pablo or maybe peteys assistant 
and my mindset is come and get me
im all alone at home with my mom and grandma and aint nobody running with me
so if you got the heart to come in here and kill a lady daughter and her grandson
nigga get the handgun
if not you gon make me call the burbs out in richmond
that have you niggas laying out on the curb they some hitmen
last couple of months i done probably been
around the world and back and i dont wanna question half the places nick been

[chorus nickelus f drake ad-libs]
i got stress on my shoulders uh
trying to keep my heart pure but this world is making it colder yeah
young black man dodge your bullets trying to get older oh
and you wonder why we turn to drugs and chain smokers yeah man
its stress my nigga
im just trying to live my life cuz
make a little money find a bunny
to make my wife cuz bo bo bo bo this that gritty shit boy
im just trying to live my life cuz got me winded over here man
make a little money find a bunny
to make my wife cuz bo bo bo bo uhyeah
check

sometimes i feel like lohan and hilary duff are the only ones with enough
to feel what im about to say in this song
when they want you to be like somebody else and you just wanna be yourself
and you do it and get the feeling its wrong
it is when all the press articles happening and the cameras get to snappin 
and they try to make you out as a lie
symbolic cuz you were just trying to please em by using logic and reason
its a lose/lose why even try
when your ideas so frequently get rejected and people just get neglected 
and they never really know how to feel
phone calls is something that youre expecting for someone without the ethics
to try and make em a mill
you never noticed the fact you might be working what im receivin at first 
and niggas wanna say that you aint around
i mean theres always some blame to put on yourselves stead of claimin you couldnt help
and maybe next time you aint in town

chorus
you gonna try to try harder cuz
try harder cuz
try try-try-try

and the managers make you succumb to pressure and you spittin the pressure
than most of the rappers running the game
concerned that people who copy whats in the past and turn the profit to cash 
theres time i would have done it the same
i mean i got me a range also got me a guilty conscience 
that made you tell anybody i meet that i ran
sometimes i wish that i woulda just chilled on the sneakers and watched the game from the bleachers 
cuz im really telling me what i spent
in a house that i promised to get my mother dont compensate for the other time 
i wasted late out at the club
instead of sitting in once a week for some dinner i working hard on the winner
so this album is a labour of love
you say as long as im staying out of the streets and just spending money on beats
then she can rest without a toss or a turn
cuz she know that my reputation perceives me and people watch me on tv
thats exactly why i often get burned 
but im gonna try to

try harder cuz
try try-try-try[lupe fiasco talking]
uh what up yall
soundtrack whats popping baby
yall aint know i go by the name of lupe fiasco
representing that first and fifteen
jyea uh
and this one right here
i dedicate this one right here
to all my homies out there grinding
you know what im saying
legally and illegally
hahaha
you know what im talking about
so check it out

[verse 1 lupe fiasco]
first got it when he was six
didnt know any tricks
matter of fact first time he got on it he slipped
landed on his hip
and bust his lip
for a week he had to talk with a lisp
like thisssss
now we can end the story right here
but shorty didnt quit there was something in the air
yea he said it was something so appealing
he couldnt fight the feeling
something about it
he knew he couldnt doubt it
couldnt understand it
brand it just the first kickflip he land it
uh labeled a misfit a bandit
kakunk kakunk kakunk
his neighbors couldnt stand it so
he was banished to the park
started in the morning wouldnt stop til after dark
yea when they said its getting late in here
so im sorry young man theres no skating here

[chorus]
and so he kick push kick push kick push kick push coast
and away he rolled
just a rebel to the world with no place to go
and so he kick push kick push kick push kick push coast
so come and skate with me
just a rebel
looking for a place to be
so lets kick and push and coast

[verse 2 drake]
waddup lupe chi town
my style is very tennessee 
mixed with some terry kennedy
people barley remember me from back in the day
i done got some contacts and threw the glasses away
the time it took me to get cool was a massive delay
but check it gets boring growing up in memphis
trying to become a pro but keep showing up apprentice
mama probably would have done anything to prevent this
cause every single time i break a board it gets expensive
luckly my aunt working as a nurse
so every time i needed something she just reach up in her purse
and plus shed always give me speeches on the first
if i m staying in her house then i need to get some work
i tell her i was there on vacation
she say you need to be doing something other than skating
why dont you go kick it with your uncle in the basement
i ma let him know that your coming honey hes waiting
so now its me and old school
chekka playa playing chess looking through old school wrek a airs
he knew i didnt really wanna post here
open up the window told me that the coast clear
now i coast clear take a deep breath feeling like the popes here
homie this is recess east test
lifes ever given me a plus graded by a teacher in a sweet dress
yes im literly landel lewis with a kick and a snare
kick flip in the air
the kids sick till them jeans put a rip in the pair
just so the space aint restricted in here
breathe again think its obvious that they need my soul
cousins at the door like ri mi fa so
i say aunty this is a safe career
she said drake i told you theres no skating here

[chorus]
and so he kick push kick push kick push kick push coast
and away he rolled
just a rebel to the world with no place to go
and so he kick push kick push kick push kick push coast
so come and skate with me
just a rebel
looking for a place to be
so lets kick and push and coast

[verse 3 lupe fiasco]
before he knew he had a crew
that wasnt no punk
and they spitfire shirts
and sb dunks
they would push til they couldnt skate no more
office building lobbies wasnt safe no more
and it wasnt like they wasnt getting chased no more
just the freedom was better than breathing they said
any escape route they used to escape out
when things got crazy
they needed to break out
they head to any place with stairs
any good grinds
the world was theirs
uh and their four wheels would take them there
until the cops came and said theres no skating here

[chorus]
and so he kick push kick push kick push kick push coast
and away he rolled
just a rebel to the world with no place to go
and so he kick push kick push kick push kick push coast
so come and skate with me
just a rebel
looking for a place to be
so lets kick and push and coastyou see the difference between me and you is that i just hit rock bottom
after this i dont have a choice i got people to provide for promises ive made and goals to meet hmm what chu got

so the p-a-trã£n had to get poured quickly
ex girl strippin
i cant stop her
new girl trippin but i cant drop her
cause i need somethin to balance out the fact
that its hard to find a woman when you talented and black
when you hollerin at labels
and they silencing you back
cause you fail to thoroughly discuss some violence in ya track
well
gunshot for the young yacht owner
see theres everybody else then theres one top loner
first place is often the worst place
but fuck it i love it here i call it my birthplace
whenever i walk in they makin the worst face
surrounded by fillipinos i think of the worst case
watch blue and green diamonds i call it the earth face
im gettin ya cake i tell you how ya dessert taste

tryna be generous so honey heres a tip
now-a-days its gettin cheaper to put 20s on the whip
so if you a opportunist look for 20s in the clip
and if you find em attractive and funny thats when you dip dip
and its a trip my city broke into sections
up north i got me a couple of troubles couple connections
and its nothing that i created on purpose theres people that gotta problem
but they scared to let it surface uh
ya boy say this that and the third to em
see me out and they never utter a word to em
expect me not to draw a card from the deck
anybody in my city going hard i respect but
you gotta debt and you choose not to pay that
imma hop ya fence come into your yard and collect lect uh
it aint a problem of concern bruh i always end up with exactly what i earn bruh
this aint last year money like a cashier so hand your receipt if you tryna make a return bruh
yessir i live in a city where a lot of people dont get shine shine
and i be on by the fence as soon as anybody stepping out of line line
and i got way too much love for the city i can never get too much of
and if anybody hatin on me i deport em the city is mine boy

chorus
yo the city is mine which one

kyanalits what you all been waiting for aint it
you weakly entertainin
for me to get a hold of this beat
go ahead claim it
imma bout to paint a picture
you niggahs go ahead frame it
since we gettin sinfeld
with that jerry and elaine shit
i flow far from medeocer
and if we talking cards i will fold him with the poker
you and your whole crew are like a deck a 54
so its obvious yall be steady rollin with some jokers
and me im rolling with some brokers
like damn can you niggahs get any broker
i got my new girl so content
just save yourself the ebarresement dont even aproch her
disguise your self go buy a costume
i am making stock works while you working stock rooms
ughh and i was praying i would drop june
but label reps applying preasure to make them pop tunes
so i keep it rocking for pet sakes
you fake gangsta rappers a clecha
and if you aint talking dough when you meet drake
ill be in your face
like no speak a la engliash
soon as you hear it you quote it
they try to be the one that i done left out the show with
but trust me im aware and my cars right there
is this interior enough for yall material motives
cause if you like it yall shud stick with me
my money good i aint neva had to flip a key
alotta ice alotta cream like dickey d
might cut the phone and disapear like mishy me
but imma try and have you on the trip with me
slid in threw a harry bendale like its slippery
and your ex mans a hatter oficialy
probably cause he know im exactly what you wish he be
yeah thats the reason why he looking hard
cause ive done snatched the chips ahoy out the cookie jar
he just made cause his gurls at the house
with her tounge stickign out
like a michael jordan rookie hard
let me addrres this parden me while i fix
a couple subliminal lines caught me in the mix
i guess he thought he could of been gotti in the flix
but at this point im just pocking a body with a stick
now a days rapping is a childrens hobby
and grils keep telling me im still this snobby
i tell them myself who i am feeling probably
just because i gotta buzz like a building lobby
it aint a song that your ass finna skipp
i tryd to sell weed give me cash for this zip
the way your girlfriend pump me up in the car
seem like she dont really need no gas for the trip
millionare shades fade with the waves
i smurk at a niggah if he still rocking braids
that just lets me know that we aint on the same page
and that goes out to every niggah except trey
eyy im outta here baby they asked me about the past years and how does it phaze me
i wudnt take it back naww not if they pay me
unless you betcha thats expencive cause its not a
spittin a crock pot of bottemless gravy
the shit is so nasty how is it tasty
and you can probably find him walking out of a macys
forget it girl they just thinking how to replace me
exit with a joke leave these niggahs some hope
you put the yay beat and put that shit in a joke
well im thinking i should leave out on this note
niggah keep your two cents i aint trynna leave you broke
life of a don lights keep gloown
come up in the club with that fresh shit on
something crazy on my arm
and heres another hit barry bondsion think they really ready for my wardrobe
i show up rite before the store clothes
and blow the feed from my last 4 shows
i do 1 song &amp; use 4 flows
she use to be a christian before
but now all she wanna do is shop for christian dior clothes
like baby those are cute i adore those
me &amp; the salesman build a reporso
he understands tha fact that im spending all sure doe
cash only transactions homie
and please no receipts the feds like to explore those
they cant audit if they dnt know i bought it
i been doin this for yrs homie thoroughly i thought it
thru what it do i am currently recorded on a track &amp; made most of my currencys imported
were too late now too legitimate to hit em with
lawsuits even if theyre crimes that i did commit
repeat offender anita baker playin in the whip as they pull me over my sweet surrender
i gotta jewish lawyer as my lead defender
a mis kite as they say is a legal bender
and atf is present every legal memeber
the coalition is so officient
you have to be invited or theres no admission
we know tradition
we spend money so dnt try to make compete if youre in no position
i wish you would listen
i take you back to this trial
where i am about to be home again like new edition
my foot is solely fit for this shoe it fits in
use to record in a basement that rennie gru was pimpin
when pops turned over the keys like a new ignition
if hov is jordan i guess im cool with pimpin
til i met janette i wanna play a new position
no team playin no screen settin
because i wanna win games coach im through assistin
the take over the breaks over nigga
and im a keep killin em until the day tht drakes over
the waits over the tapes coming
they bullshittin but im a comer w great plumbing
the human mentalitys so eager to hate somethingg
i try to play it off like it aint jumpin
and its the predicament that you found drake in
they collo that i just purchased is sound vacant
cause i have just been sittin in this cell
thinkin what i coulda done to make my first video ground breaking
and whenever im flowing on the mic
aside from the d im throwin in ya wife
i treat this one session as if it was my last
and i pretend tomorrow is the day im going in for lifeok there comes a time when you gotta be like
you know ive come this far on my own
done a lot for myself
where to now ya know
but i just tell myself this one thing

it was worth it it was all worth it
and by this time i understand that i aint perfect
there aint a pair of louis shoes i aint purchased
and i was on some shit but they served they purpose
and i got verses i got verses
my 16s should be arriving in hearses
they get bodied you see how i murk this
i switch flows much as my girl switch purses
yeah heartbreak drake ill put it on your wife
if i put it in a verse then i put it on my life
liquor thats over ice and denim thats over priced
and tryna make all my goals for the future come over night
got got got got damn how time soars
im tryna get that house in toronto with pine floors
come over watch a season of flight of the concords
and i try to put some lotion all over your contours
but uh tell me you surfin let me know you on board
you cant seal up the bottle once all of the dimes poured
yes i swear to god girl i put it on lord
im tryna show you life through the tint on these tom fords
ethiopian girl ethiopian girl with yo long curly hair and yo big ass bootay
reading all them pro black pro female books
just let em let em know that you aint no groupie
you need a prescription a vision correction
im young and successful im living perfection
and man if 09 is when im a see mine
being cool aint enough homie im a freeze time like that[chorus] 
take what you want take what you wa-ah-aha-ant take what you want take what you want but you gotta share it with the world x3

can you imagine the last breath of christ
the last breath of christopher wallace on that faithful night
the last step that martin lurther took as a man
i got the power of my world in my hand
the microphone brings life or death in the blink of an eye
i was born to provoke those born to die 
i was conceived to beat all odds like las vegas 
t-dot mutherfucker watch the world rape us 
great test strugglers hustler to us succeed 
cross water smugglers tussel to burn weed 
it meets that pressure to success in the south
niggas watchin what i say magnifin my mouth 
i never take back talk i apply the force  
hand blistering for many years of holding the torch  

when the skin rebuilds it grows tougher then leather  
so we can keep on hold it forever  
my names kardinall

chorus
i gotta make it out or move quickly cant allow the past to restrict me
but this time around they wont skip me i am the last hope dont hesitate

drake
jealousy is suttin i havent felt in years  theres nobody around for me to be jealous off  i bet you do is showing my city and no one cheers even if you make the music that ladies and fellas love and dove  im incredible often unforgettable but when it comes to records i will eat it if its editable  they say the futures always for-seen thats why im steady getting more money more cream  my flow is stuck in the moment that comes before a dream i stay avoiding unlucky like 14  and people get behind and they fight for em cause he wont let no other niggas wright for em  and even when its quite warm the attitude coursing through the veins and my city is an ice storm  the names drake and i dont take it for granted i can take it you offended cause im taken advantage mang  

chorus
i gotta make it out or move quickly cant allow the past to restrict me

ive got it made thats what im talking about

goin down to the dealers buy myself a brand new car
so me and my lady can riiiide

check
i wish yall coulda seen me back in high school
backpack grey range black ac
coulda had the stack out just to get a stack back
double that school dance
fresh jakes new pants
back but fuck bitches get money was the new chat
it started out a boy like hugh grant
now im a young man doin things you cantswear to you lord
same dudes that used to laugh at me
see me in the cl6 with half a b
they know that money begets money so naturally
me i have to blow a couple of stacks hassle free
im like f*ck yall haters on behalf on me
cause i could flood the city with a staff of three
im talking me and two partners in that caprice
with no copies made i got the master keys
and fast cars fast women fast cash and cream
could mold you rappers like plaster see
i have the dreams but dog me and success are two things
you dont wanna find your ass between
back against the wall like a plasma screens
the inside of my wallet is pasture green
and you are now hanging with the asthma team
sweetie catch your breath while is smash the scene
i should leave earth its nothing left to do here
everyday is christmas and every night is new years
say whatever i never been concerned about who hears
call my town sparta and im coming with two spears
im telling you dog always got the spring collection in fall
i run my bill up making executives calls
and with me women be building these skeptical walls
but once you slept with one dime man you slept with them all
family money and music is all i ever knew
my neck will suffer from depression
it is forever blue
cheer up baby you dont see all this revenue
i started the game at level two im saying
stop acting like teen girls are my only market
i parallel flying spur tony park it
and its cool if you spill something its only carpet
thats why i get my interior colors only dark shit
if torontos where you living today
then you aint making records the people are driven to play
i would advise you to really make a move
sooner than later
cause these are only the joints
im giving away

and my liscense just expired
so i got to go renew it
cuz i just bought a truck
and i am dying to debut it
and naw it aint a buick
i never redezvous it
im just in the burg with trigga
and im faded off the fluid

so how the f**k you want to do it
my nigga you better do itayedo it
i say this heres a practice song
and lately i been out in hollywood

i like to laugh alone
i get my cash alone
thats why i shop alone
this heres my uncles car
i drive it and the top is gone
your skin looks like you bathe in magnesia
and coppertone
and girl i heard your mans a fed

that big things are popping on
so baby wipe me down
i sell a watch and swap a home

im in a proper zone
thats right the doctors home
this heres my time
and i dont even think your clock is on

baby what you bes bout
i mean for tonight ho
if i break them trees out

so i can j holiday that ass
before i leaves out
holla at me shawty

[chorus x1][drake]
yeah 9th wonder dont judge me man
they tend to say that us rappers are materialistic
they say we lack substance
me te and el bout to prove em wrong though

[chorus drake]
uh we know what youre thinking love
you think we out smoking and drinking love
pushing big whips chains clinking love
but yall dont really know me like you think you know me
we know how you speculate
thinking we gon hit your friend if you object to date
claim were early and be showing up extra late love
but yall dont really know me like you think you know me

[drake]
uh el be saying that im humble im hella nice
for that ive been approached to sign to roc-a-fella twice
haters tell you all the rumors they heard
and we laugh soon as you come and tell me like im ellen brice
my groove theory is that when you too cheery
they try to bring you down to the level they at
well when they are all unhappy then it gets a little sticky
thats why i am little nicky to these devils in rap
but uh they aint thinking drake get smart girl
nah they probably think ill break your heart girl
haha i cant lie you probably right about it
and if you give me the ass quick ill probably write about it
but i hate it when they judge me on how i sound
i mean i spit that influential shit from my town
i dont know why you sitting on the couch
when you see i got a bed bring your ass here and lie down
you think taking your purse off
will lead to me you taking shirts off and then your skirt off
at least i got status because i couldve been a local emcee
and you probably wouldve been worse off
so im a take this hat off and im a hit it till i backs off
and then im back sorrowful
cause you thinking you can predict what happen
you the reason im thinking im getting sick of rapping

[chorus]

[phonte]
you probably think i walk around with my gun tucked and
swang dick to these hoes like nunchucks
well you can think what you want but
i think youve been watching too much bet uncut
you need to get real and check out my real life
i aint a tip-trail dont care what it smell like
but if you feel like putting all your notions aside
and talking to a real nigga id gladly oblige
first name phonte id be pleased to date ya
college educated got degrees in papers
but im from the south where if you aint snapping
or rapping bout trapping youse a freak of nature
such an anomaly speak so well
and talk so collegy such an astonishing
contrast to all the bullshit youve been following
on behalf of them i offer my apologies
maybe with me youll unlearn
putting all niggas in a box of concerns
me cause i aint dumb shit im well reared/red like sunburn
and after me youll never leave no stone unturned uh cmon

[chorus]

[elzhi]
they say you never judge a book by its cover
though you appear as materialistic just like the others
so i followed your words to take em in
and i dont see what you saying so they coming off paper thin
thats when i felt that i would need to
do more than just look you up and down to see if i could read you
and try to get inside your head only
not just stick my fingers in your middle to get you to spread for me
so what i learned on my path to discover
your story took one ugly turn after another
i saw we wasnt on the same page
i wouldve gave you strong play but your words rubbed me the wrong way
so now im closing the case
you only out for the paperback thats written all over your face
no el will never judge a book by its cover
until he seen what was in between and looked at what lies are under

[chorus]teach you a lesson remix lyrics

drake verse 1
hip hops newest and youngest acquisition
if this was you i wonder what youd do in that position
try to make a profit or try to make a difference
try to make em play your shit or try to make em listen
i go from records with dwele and lb and elzhi
the meetings where they tell me to start making records and that  theyll buy
now im out in a-town
they tellin me trey sound
its too mainstream if i plan on me stickin around
but the allure of this years scream tour has been cuttin all them jawns that be hurtin the game
i be dreamin bout hoes and doin them live shows
shirtless thats why i started to personal train
dog personally mane
im a person that came to bring purpose to a seem unless they purpose is game
it never feel like its earned when you purchase the fame
now my thoughts gettin deeper and im searchin the game
i keep on on on on on

drake [saukrates] chorus

and now the girls like
its only drake got chased and so the artists i respected try and take my place
but pimpin aint easy man and neither is rappin
they one in the same when you need it to happen
my city full of players they just needed a captain
in need of him right now in need of him back then
but back then i was actin
nowadays i serve backhands with backspin
tryin to prove rappers are intelligent black men
whoever chose to back out is back in
they say theres two sides to every story and three when the truth get told
so grab a spoon fore your soup get cold
when you drive it off the lot is when your coupe get old
so please discover an answer fore proof gets sold
and keep on on on on on

drake [saukrates] chorus
[yeah] im killin em all all all all
im killin em all allim performin tonight you know that shit gon be packed

my ex girl ill probably show up for the simple fact
that tomorrow she can tell all of her friends it was whack
but fuck that though this about me
they say my whole fan base is missing id
but the young trend setting musician i be
got critics giving up the recognition i de-serve

long awaited hated
fans see me out and they holla happy belated

when i was up in hot beat in atlanta steady giving daps
fetching niggas drinks but i never got to rap
if anybody asked though i prolly woulda snapped
but i cant sign nothing til my lawyer get the fax and
no one decides who the definition of talent is
and mrs murry look at what my talent did
and what yo business is
its been a couple years
guess its not about who you know its just how you balance it
its always awkward to dummy a nigga artist
and get on someone song when you know you comin the hardest

goodness gracious the top is such a hard place yeah

and maybe you dont need the help but i just gotta see for myselfdrake

20 thousand for a verse is our routine quote
im getting rich aah  you staying broke
chilling if even if im in a goose down coat
i cant see you through the mosley tribes
so i dont even flinch when you throw me high fives
they try to measure up but theres no one my size

grounded as the one way pavement am taking flight off
baby go ahead and cut the light off
cuz its about to go

beat plays

i hear my phone ringing when ya call
i aint picking up or entertaining them at all
got your girl face down banging on the wall
while you and all your homeboys hang at lenox mall
mmm mmm mmm
i cannot relate

and i know what to do wit it 
i know what to do wit it 
i know what to do wit it 
i know what to do wit it 

its 6 oclock in the morning at the studiowhy do i feel so alone
like everybody passing through the studio
is in character as if we acting out a movie role
talking bullshit as if it was for you to know
and i dont have the heart to give these
bitch ass niggas the cue to go
so they stick around kicking out feedback
and i entertaining as if i need that
i had a talk with my uncle and he agreed that
my privacy about the only thing i need back
but its hard to think of them polite flows
mr fano poloto suits on your night clothes
and jordan sweat suits are your flight clothes
and you still make it even when they say your flight closed
eyes hurting from the camera phone light shows
life was so full
now this shits just been light pole
always said id say it all on the right track
but in this game u only lose when you fight back
black diamond bracelets
showing you the basics
i cant live and hold the camara
someone gotta tape dis
i make hits and like a bitch
just married i aint miss
24 hours from greatness
im that close to
dont ever forget the moment
you began to doubt
transitioning from fitting in to standing out
los angeles cabanas or atlanta south
watchin home shows
embarrassed to pull my camera out
and my mother embarased
to put my phantom out
so i park about 5 houses down
she said i shouldnt have until i have the crown
but i dont wanna feel the need to wear disguises around
so she wonder where my mind is and counts in the minus
but yet im rolling round the fuckin city like your highness
got niggas reactin without a sinus
cause what im working with is timeless
and promoters trying to get me out to they club
and say i have fun but i cant imagine how
cause i just see my ex-girl
standing with my next girl
standing with the girl that im fuckin right now
and shit could get weird unless they all down
and so i stay clear
we from a small town
and everybody talks and everybody listen
and somehow the truth just always comes up missing
ive always been something dat these lables cant buy
especially if they tryin to take a peice of my soul
and still b only tellin tales damn drake fly
and he just be like silly mother fucker i know
that was your bad
how could you pass up on em
he just take the records
and he gas up on em
wayne will prolly put a million cash up on em
surprised no one ever put your ass up on em
oh they did pole
at least they try to
and thats what happens
when you spitting whats inside you
but slip up and shoot the wrong fucking video
and they think they can market you
however they decide to naww
before they told me to do me
and dont listen to anybody that knew me
cause who of known me would
mean that theres a new me
and if you think ive changed in the slightest
could of fooled me
baa into my city im da 2-3
drug dealers live vicariously through me
i quit school and is not because im lazy
im just not the social type
and campus life is crazy understand
i could get money with my eyes closed
lost some of my hottest versus down at cabo
so if you find a blackberry with the sides scroll
sell that mothafucka to any rapper that i know
cause they need it much more than i ever will
i got new shit
im gettin better still
little niggas put my name in their verses
cause they girlfriend put my ass on a pedestal
future said cause its ye shit you better kill
and i think its got them making of a legend feel
problem with these other niggas they
aint never real
yea thats all i can sayuh ooh ooh uh ooh ooh uh ooh oooh
uh ooh ooh uh ooh ooh uh ooh oooh
uh ooh ooh uh ooh ooh uh ooh oooh

[lykke li]
hands down

but with eyes shut

uh im just so far gone octobers own please leave me alone
drunk off champagne screamin in the phone
see my house is not a home fuck is goin on
where did we go wrong where do we belong
caught up in the game and its one i cant postpone
meaning if it rains im the one its raining on
when my diamond chain is on still nothing set in stone
women borrow sweaters that i spray with my cologne
and tell me dont forget em and i promise that i wont
feelin so distant from everyone ive known
to make everybody happy i think i would need a clone
places we get flown parties that weve thrown
ive done more for this city then these rappers that have blown
its only been 3 years look at how ive grown
im just in my zone i call this shit the calm
yea but im the furthest thing from calm
dedicated to my mom and i swear my word is bond
everything will be ok and it wont even take that long
you can see it in my face or even read it on my palm
leader of the new school its proven and its known
im sittin in a chair but in the future its a throne
i know you like to worry itll be better if you dont cause

[talking]
you know everything gone be alright i promise a
pologize to you know to put yall in this position and vent to yall but
40 mom always say dont ask permisson just ask forgiveness
you know so forgive me

[verse 2]
uh and life is so insane look what ive became tryna make a name
all my first dates are interrupted by my fame
because every picture taken is a fan that you can gain
they love it when you smile unaware that its a strain
its a curse you gotta live with when you born to entertain
women need attention and fore women will complain
develop hatred for men and say that your the one to blame
tryna enjoy myself with taz in miami at the game
i just wish he knew how much it really weighed like dwayne
its a weight thats on my chest whoever spottin me is playin
so im liftin all alone try not to get a sprain
hopin western union doing currency exchange
cause my dad called and got me feelin guilty and ashamed
like how i had a rolls and i went and got a range
and he payin for his cigarettes with dollars and some change
damn and i could only feel his pain
cause in memphis tennessee theres only so much to attain
so im fillin out the form at the counter once a-gain
he say he love me i just hope he doesnt say that shit in vain
im why ya girl heart is in a slang
call me heartbreak drake im the hardest one to tame
as a man im just honest as a artist im a king
with my own set of problems that be sittin on my brain
yea and see this is the thang
what they viewing as braggin is the way that i maintain
the shit i write while staring out the window of a plane
is the single handed reason i remain

[talking]
me yea uh i said i call this shit the calm
but im the furthest thing from calm
i swear im puttin on but they always wanna ask what type of act you puttin on like man<span style=padding1em><img alt=trebleclef class= data-image-key=trebleclefpng data-image-name=trebleclefpng height=68 src=http//vignette2wikianocookienet/lyricwiki/images/1/1e/trebleclefpng/revision/latest/scale-to-width/30cb=20090423154754 width=30/></span> instrumentalthis here is on some truthful shit
it seems like everything i do your used to it
and i hate hearing stories bout who youve been with
so then i gotta hide what im feeling inside
so you still think im confident and damn
is this gonna last your up on a pedastal
are we moving too fast
feel like im in crazy competition with the past
is why i gotta ask 

is anything im doing brand new
brand new brand new brand new brand new brand new
is anything im doing brand new
brand new brand new brand new brand new brand new

this here is something personal
i highly doubt this feeling is reversible
knowledge is pain and that is why it hurts to know
that you attempt to hide and put mistakes aside
so i dont ever question you and damn
i cant even find the perfect brush
so i can paint whats going through my mind
racing against myself but im a couple steps behind
this why i gotta ask 

is anything im doing brand new
brand new brand new brand new brand new brand new
is anything im doing brand new
brand new brand new brand new brand new brand new 

is anything im doing brand new6x
or is everything im doing too late6x

did he take off your clothes off just like this
did he give you loving just like this
did you spend the night in his bed on the very first date
tell me baby am i too late

is anything im doing brand new
brand new brand new brand new brand new brand new
show me if this is brand new
brand new brand new brand new brand new brand new

and me falling and landing in love i dont think should happen
becuase everythings easier to get into than get out off
but someone show me to the owner of this city
cause the owners always seem to be the only people with me

reintroduced to people ive been introduced to
did you forget me
or are you too scared to tell me that you met me
and fear that i wont remember i wish you could still accept me for me

i dont drink every bottle i own i be agin shit
and i got them wedding ring flows that engagin shit

havin lunch and debatin ferrari prices
23 and goin through a midlife crisis
but trust me i still deliver like a midwife
and no im not sayin im the nicest i just live life like it
uh it take a certain type of man to teach
to be far from hood but to understand the streets
i never threw away that paper with my grammy speech

kisses all on her body she tells me live in the moment
and baby ill never forget none of that

i live by some advice this girl lissa told me 
the other day lissa told me that she missed the old me 
which made me question when i went missing 
and when i start treating my friends different 

maybe it was the fast pace switch up or the two guns in my face during the stick up 
maybe cause a girl i thought i trusted was who set the whole shit up
but a fact i havent seen em since they locked big rich up
 i know the same time im quick to forget 

about to roll me a blunt with my list of regrets 
burn it all burn it all im starting it fresh 
cause half the time i got it right i probably guessed

and when it come to making history im like  son

a million dollars stacked it sounds like a good beginning
we on the top now go back and tell the hook we winning
and while ya there let em know we did it just for them
i made them cough the cash up and left them just the phlegm

and his testosterone is up whos got the oestrogen

so til i see the ref waving i will not retire
my flow is still official and i still got the fire

half a million dollars later and my taxes paid
and iã¢m still spendinã¢ money from my acting days you know you know

upoloaded by justin j-tee tate[drake - verse 1] 
money just changed everything 
i wonder how life without it would go 
from the concrete who knew that a flower would grow 
lookin down from the top and its crowded below 
my fifteen minutes started an hour ago

truth over fame you know i respect the blatant shit 
when i em hear talkin 
i just dont know what to make of it 
hate is so familiar to me 
im slowly embracing it

doesnt come natural 
bear wit me it could take a bit 
yeah and my dreams are who im racin with 
you can see im pacin it so that im always chasin it 
wayne put me right here 
thats who i get the paper wit

i hope that my success never alters our relationship 
yeah this life is somethin i would die for 
octobers own but its lookin like july 4 
i just wish theyd let you try it first 
this time im really goin off fireworks 

[chorus] 
oh today it begins 
ive missed them before but wont miss them again 
i keep having the same dream 
and i think that i just realized what it means 

[alicia keys] 
all i see is fireworks 
all i see is fireworks 
every night its fireworks 
every night its fireworks

all i see is fireworks 
all i see is fireworks 
taking off like fireworks 
taking off like oh-ah-oh-oh 

[drake - verse 2] 
im just such a gentleman you should give it up for me 
look at how im placing all my napkins and my cutlery 
i can tell it wasnt love i just thought you fuck with me 
who coulda predicted lucky strike will have you stuck with me
damn i kept my wits about me luckily 

what happened between us that night it always seems to trouble me 
now all of a sudden these gossip brags wanna cover me 
and you makin it seem that it happened that way because of me 
but i was curious and ill never forget it baby
what an experience you coulda been the one but it wasnt that serious 

there was smoke in the air before now its me clearin it 
that felt good all and all i learned a lesson from it though 
you never see it comin you just get to see it go 
yeah i shoulda looked up in the sky at first 
now i can see it in her eyes 
fireworks 

[chorus] 
oh today it begins 
ive missed them before but wont miss them again 
i keep having the same dream 
and i think that i just realized what it means

[drake - verse 3] 
everything the same but it feels different 
my dad called me up knowing that i still listen 
and hes still got his foot out guilt trippin 
its been years though i just learned to deal with it

for real me and my realtor we built up a better rapport 
got my mother in a place with some better decor 
she searched the entire city i let her explore 
and now shes sayin she more lonely than every before

how many of our parents marriages lasted 
i was only five i bet i barely reacted 
im flyin back home for the heritage classic 
searchin for that feelin tell me where is the magic

lets stay together till were ghosts 
i want to witness love ive never seen it close 
yeah but i guess i gotta find it first 
yhats why im really goin off fireworks 

[chorus]
oh today it begins 
ive missed them before but wont miss them again 
i keep having the same dream 
and i think that i just realized what it meansthings have been so crazy and hectic
i should have gotten back by now
but you know how much i wanted to make it
its probably better anyhow

so if you gotta go
if theres anything i should know
if the spotlight makes you nervous
if youre looking for a purpose

you put the tea in the kettle and light it
put your hand on the metal and feel it
but do you even feel it anymore
i remember when you thought i was joking

now im all singing karaoke
further than ive ever been
so if you gotta go
if theres any way i can help

isnt it ironic that the girl i wanna marry is a wedding planner
that tells em my life is too much and moves to atlanta
damn of all the places you could go
i just thought youd choose somewhere that has somebody that you know

i always up too late i worry bout you there alone
in that place you call your home
warm nights and cold patron
i hope you dont get known for nothing crazy
cause no man ever wants to hear those stories bout his lady

i know they say the first love is the sweetest
but that first cut is the deepest
i tried to keep us together you were busy keeping secrets
secrets you were telling everybody but me
dont be fooled by the money im still young and just unlucky
im surprised you couldnt tell

i was only trying to get ahead
i was only trying to get ahead
but the spotlight makes you nervous
and youre looking for a purpose

i was only trying to get ahead
i was only trying to get ahead
but the spotlight makes you nervous
and youre looking for a purpose[intro]

in the bathroom flat irons and nail files
spending hours in salons on your hairstyles
in the mall steady racking up the air miles

hit the gym step on the scales stare at the number
you say you dropping 10 pounds preparing for summer
and you don’t do it for the man men never notice
you just do it for yourself you’re the fucking coldest

intelligent too ooh you’re my sweetheart
i’ve always liked my women book and street smart
long as they got a little class like half days
and the confidence to overlook my past ways

time heals all and heels hurt to walk in
but they go with the clutch that you carry your lip gloss in
and look i really think that nobody does it better
i love the way you put it together

man all of your flows bore me paint drying
and i dont ever be trippin off of what aint mine
and i be hearing shit you say through the grapevine
but jealousy is just love and hate at the same time
its been that way from the beginning

and this is the only sound you should fear
man these kids wear crowns over here and everything is alright

[hook]

time to take you away from me
only over my dead body

[drake - verse 2]

the men are jealous and the women all in competition
and now your friends telling you stories that you often misinterpret
and taint all your images of your mr perfect

and really i think i like who im becoming
theres times where i might do it just to do it like its nothing
theres times when i might blow like 50k on a vacation
for all my soldiers just to see the looks on all they faces all it took was patience

i got a lot of friends to come up off the strip for me
the same ones thatll come up off the hip for me
the realest niggas say your lyrics do shit for me
i told my story then made history

ive never really been one for the preservation of money nah

if you was in a pine box
i would surely break the lock
i’d jump right in and fall asleep
cause you are the death of me

[kendrick lamar]
looking in the mirror i’m embarrassed
i’m feeling like a suicidal terrorist
react like an infant whenever you are mentioned
mind over matter never worked for my nemesis
i’m in the matter of man arm wrestling
hands i was dealt when i said the music business was all i needed
when i got it i was greeted by an alien
that said last year that she slept with a canadian
that gave him an addiction that would keep him in mercedes benz
bright lights and rihanna as a lady friend
my vice is similar women love when youre my type
and youre winning from everything that your palm write
put her in the palms hotel sin city
devil in a dress platinum chanel
live the ambiance all cause the audience
one day said i would do it
so instead of a verse being read
imma go and get some head off the strength of my music
i tell a bad bitch your ass too fat
capitalize that and your weave look good with the indian tracks
tracking device on your used 5 series
i don’t call back just blame it on your canadian
the same day we say were in the area cruisin in toronto
hit me on the cellular thought he was gonna sell me a false word
like the rappers i know
sat down with a few drinks located where you can’t see us
a white waitress on standby when we need her
a black maybach 40 pulled up jeep
no doors all that nigga was missing was aaliyah
felt like the initiation
a reality living in the matrix
we talk casually about the industry
and how the women be the taste makers for the shit we making
then he said that he was the same age as myself
and it didn’t help cause it made me even more rude an impatient
so blame it on mr ovoxo the reason why i’m breathing all the vanity i know
the reason why my best friend said she love me more than life
but i live a double life and need to let her go
the reason why the highlight was when he said
you belong to the people when you outside
so dig a shovel full of money full of power full of pussy full of fame
and bury yourself alive then i died[verse 1]
bridge over troubled water ice in my muddy water
rich off a mixtape got rich off a mixtape
probably shouldnt be driving it just got so much harder
cant even see straight i cant even see straight
oh fuck with me i buy the shots
live a little cause niggas die a lot and lie a lot
but im the truth -- thats right i fucking said it
the living proof that you dont gotta die to get to heaven
you girl you right there you look like you like this hit
howd i know howd i know thats me on some psychic shit
i can tell a lie if you ask me my where-abouts
but i might talk that real if you ask me what i care about
rap and bitches rap and bitches bitches
and rappin rappin and bitches until all of it switches
i swear its been two years since somebody asked me who i was
im the greatest man i said that before i knew i was
thats whats important and what really happened before this
when me and my crew was all about this rapper from new orleans
singing walking like a man finger on the trigger
i got money in my pocket im a uptown nigga  ah
with fame on my mind my girl on my nerves
i was pushing myself to get something that i deserve
that was back in the days acura days
i was a cold dude im getting back to my ways

[hook]
people always ask how i got my nice things

 do it for the city cause you know the city love a nigga 
 do it for the city cause you know the city love a nigga

so im going through her phone if she go to the bathroom
and her purse right there i dont trust these hoes at all
but thats just the result of me paying attention
to all these women that think like men with the same intentions
talking strippers and models that try to gain attention
even a couple porn stars that im ashamed to mention
but weezy and stunna my only role models
hefner and jordan my only role models
thats why i walk around with all this gold on
and every time i run into these niggas they want no problems
bottom sixes and chains and some bracelets and rings
all of the little accents that make me a king
i never hear the disses they try and point out to me
but its whatever if somebody wan make it a thing
im more concerned what niggas thinkin about christmas in august
do anything to buy gifts for they daughters
get some shake a brick in the press
and chef it like mrs fields; theyre making the cookie stretch
i know it so well i know the hustle so well
stunt like im working overnighters right by the motel

matchin rollies for real matchin rovers for real
places they say theyve been weve actually going for real
im really killin shit fuck all the jiggy rapping
im going trigga happy just to see my niggas happy
mixtape legend underground kings
lookin for the right way to do the wrong things
with my new bitch thats living in palm springs
young ass nigga lifelong dreams
they take the greats from the past and compare us
i wonder if theyd ever survive in this era
in a time where its recreation
to pull all your skeletons out the closet like halloween decorations
i know of all the things that i hear they be poking fun at
never the flow though they know i run that
fuck you all i claim that whenever
i change rap forever the game back together yeah
ym i remain that forever
in the same place my brother wayne at forever
im a descendent of either marley or hendrix
i havent figured it out cause my story is far from finished
im hearing all of the jokes i know that they tryna push me
i know that showin emotion dont ever mean im a pussy
know that i dont make music for niggas who dont get pussy
so those are the ones i count on to diss me or overlook me
lord knows lord knows im heavy i got my weight up
roberson boost your rate up its time that somebody paid up
a lot of niggas came up off of a style that i made up
but if all i hear is me then who should i be afraid of
bought a white ghost now shit is gettin spooky
very very scary like shit you see in the movies
in this bitch all drinks on the house like snoopy
thats why all the real soldiers salute me
trill nigga for real

the good ones go if you wait too long
so you should go
you should go before you stay too long

[verse 2]
dont you go getting married dont you go get engaged
i know youre getting older dont have no time to waste
i shouldnt be much longer but you shouldnt have to wait
cant lose you cant help it im so sorry im so selfish
uh uh ive been chilling in the city where the moneys thrown high and the girls get down
in case youre starting to wonder why my new shits sounding so h-town
but when its all done baby im yours if youre still around
she knows she knows she knows

[hook][verse 1]
when a good thing goes bad its not the end of the world
its just the end of a world that you had with one girl
and shes the reason it happened but shes overreacting
and its all because she dont want things to change

[hook]
so cry if you need to but i cant stay to watch you
thats the wrong thing to do
touch if you need to but i cant stay to hold you
thats the wrong thing to do
talk if you need to but i cant stay to hear you
thats the wrong thing to do
cause you say you love me and ill end up lying
and say i love you too

but i need someone different
you know it oh ho you know it
oh ho you know it we both know it
i need someone different
you know it oh ho you know it
oh ho you know it we both know it
somethings been missing
you know it oh ho she knows it
oh ho i know it we all know it
i need someone different
oh ho oh ho

[verse 2]
we live in a generation of not being in love and not being together
but we sure make it feel like were together
because were scared to see each other with somebody else

shower her with dollar tips
shawty went and bought a whip
guarantee the city remember your whole name
you throw the ho a scholarship

all of them aint all equipped
and this saddens me i see the pecking order
quote-unquote bad bitches work the whole floor
those that get laughed at sit off in the corner

like a lab rat nobody want her
niggas that are married dont wanna go home
we look up to them they wish they were us
they want some new trim

we lust for some trust
now the both of us are colorblind
cause the other side looks greener
which leaves your turf in the boise state

cant see her play or the team cause
everybody has an addiction; mine happens to be you
and those who say they dont
souls will later on say to them that aint true

all of them will have an opinion
but yall know what you can do with them
but if you unsure ill take you on tour
to a place i can stick that in

well sitting here sad as hell
listening to adele i feel you baby
someone like you more like someone unlike you
or someone thats familiar maybe

and i can tell that she wants a baby
and i can yell girl that shit crazy
oh what the hell nope cant be lazy
please be careful bitches got the rabies[drake]
gotta do what i gotta do

[verse 1 drake]
all my exes live in texas like im george strait
or they go to georgia state where
tuition is handled by some random nigga that live in atlanta
that she only see when she feels obligated
admitted it to me the first time we dated
but she was no angel and we never waited

i took her for sushi she wanted to fuck
so we took it to go told them dont even plate it
and we never talk too much after i blew up
just only hello or happy belated

and i think i text her and told her i made it
and thats when she text me and told me she prayed it
and thats when i text her and told her i love it
and right after texting told her im faded

she asked
what have i learned since getting richer
i learned working with the negatives could make for better pictures
i learned hennessy and enemies is one hell of a mixture
even though its fucked up girl im still fucking wit ya

damn is it the fall
time for me to revisit the past
its women to call
theres albums to drop theres liquor involved

theres stories to tell we been through it all
interviews are like confessions
get the fuck up out my dressing room confusing me with questions
like

[hook lil wayne]
do you love this shit
are you high right now
do you ever get nervous
are you single
i heard you fucked your girl is it true
you getting money you think them niggas you with is with you
and i say

and i say hell yeah
hell yeah hell yeah

and we say hell yeah

[verse 2 lil wayne]
so much for being optimistic
they say love is in the air so i
hold my breath until my face turn purple
keep a few bad bitches in my circle

my nuts hang like aint no curfew
bitch if you wave then i will surf you
i flew jet she flew commercial
but we still met later that night

after my session she came over
i was aggressive and she was sober
i gave her pills
she started confessing and started undressing

and ask me to hold her
and so i did but that was last month
and now shes texting me asking for closure
damn
she say this shit gon catch up to me
i keep tissue paper

we eat each other whenever we at the dinner table
she say she hate that she love me
and she wish i was average
shit sometimes i wish the same
and i wish she wasnt married

promises i hope i never break em
met a female dragon had a fire conversation but
interviews are like confessions
get the fuck up out my bedroom confusing me with questions like

[hook lil wayne]

bitches smiling at you it must be happy hour
they put the cloth across your lap soon as you sat down

worst behaviorwhats up been a minute since we kicked it
youve been caught up with them bitches
i dont get it youre a star love
you shouldnt have to deal with that
ill never make you feel like that

cause i love me i love me enough for the both of us
thats why you trust me i know you been through more than most of us
so what are you what are you what are you so afraid of
darling you you give but you cannot take love

i needed to hear that shit i hate when youre submissive
passive aggressive when were texting i feel the distance
i look around the peers that surround me these niggas tripping
i like when money makes a difference but dont make you different
started realizing a couple places i can take it
i want to get back to when i was that kid in the basement
i want to take it deeper than money pussy vacation
and influence a generation thats lacking in patience
ive been dealing with my dad speaking a lack of patience
just me and my old man getting back to basics
weve been talking bout the future and time that we wasted
when he put that bottle down girl that niggas amazing
well fuck it we had a couple coronas
we might have rolled a white paper just something to hold us
we even talked about you and our couple of moments
he said we should hash it out like a couple of grown ups
you a flower child beautiful child im in your zone
looking like you came from the 70s on your own
my mother is 66 and her favorite line to hit me with is
who the fuck wants to be 70 and alone
yall dont even know what you want from love anymore
i search for something im missing and disappear when im bored
but girl what qualities was i looking for before
who you settling for who better for you than the boy hah

cause i love me i love me enough for the both of us
thats why you trust me i know you been through more than most of us
so what are you what are you what are you so afraid of
darling you you give but you cannot take love

thinkin about texas back when porsche used to work at treasures
or further back then that before i had the houston leverage
when i got summer a michael kors with my mommas debit
a weak attempt at flexing ill never forget it
cause that night i played her three songs
then we talked about something we disagreed on
then she started telling me how ill never be as big as trey songz
boy was she wrong that was just negative energy for me to feed off
now its therapeutic blowing money in a galleria
or beverly center macys where i discovered bria
landmarks to the muses that inspired the music
when i could tell it was sincere without trying to prove it
the one that i needed was kourtney from hooters on p street
ive always been feeling like she was the piece to complete me
now she engaged to be married whats the rush on commitment
know we were going through some shit name a couple that isn’t
remember our talk in the parking lot at the ritz
girl i felt we had it all planned out guess i fucked up the vision
learning the true consequences of my selfish decisions
when you find out how i’m living i just hope i’m forgiven
it seems like you don’t want this love anymore
i’m acting out in the open it’s hard for you to ignore
but girl what qualities was i looking for before
who you settling for who better for you than the boy huh

cause i love me i love me enough for the both of us
thats why you trust me i know you been through more than most of us
so what are you what are you what are you so afraid of
darling you you give but you cannot take lovei got my eyes on you youre everything that i see
i want your hot love and emotion endlessly
i cant get over you you left your mark on me
i want your hot love and emotion endlessly

cause youre a good girl and you know it
you act so different around me
cause youre a good girl and you know it
i know exactly who you could be

just hold on were going home

i got my eyes on you youre everything that i see
i want your hot love and emotion endlessly
i cant get over you you left your mark on me
i want your hot love and emotion endlessly

cause youre a good girl and you know it

i heard what circulated lets get to the bottom of it
i told 1da send me something and i got it covered
somehow always rise above it
why you think i got my head in the clouds on my last album cover
the game is all mine and im mighty possessive
lil wayne could not have found him a better successor
every shot you see them take at me they all contested
allen iverson shoe deal these niggas all in question
last night i went to sleep wanted more
tried to decide what direction i should go towards
some nights i wish i could go back in life
not to change shit just to feel a couple things twice
28 at midnight wonder whats next for me
longevity wonder how long theyll check for me
prolly forever if i stay in my zone
i speak on this generation but cant change it alone
i heard a lil lil homie talking reckless in vibe
thats quite a platform you chose you shoulda kept it inside
oh you tried
its so childish calling my name on the world stage
you need to act your age and not your girls age
it gets worse by the annual my careers like a how to manual
so i guess its understandable man
oh you gotta love it you gotta love it cheer
i know rappers that call paparazzi to come and get em
to show they outfits off guess they need the attention
i remember when it used to be music that did it
but then again times have changed man who are we kiddin
im managed by my friends that i grew up with
id rather give that 15% to people i fuck with
if me and future hadnt made it with this rappin
we prolly be out in silicon tryna get our billions on
but here we are yeah
lately i feel the haters eatin away at my confidence
they scream out my failures and whisper my accomplishments
bitches alter my messages like we have words
and stories bout my life hit the net like a bad serve
bitter women im overtextin are pmsing crazy this year
fuckin with my image
ive been tryna reach the youth so i can save em this year
fuck it i guess i gotta wait til next year
and i heard someone say something that stuck with me a lot
bout how we need protection from those protectin the block
nobody lookin out for nobody
maybe we should try and help somebody or be somebody
instead of bein somebody that makes the news
so everybody can tweet about it
and then they start to rip about it
and four weeks later nobody even speaks about it
damn i just had to say my piece about it
oh you gotta love it
but they scared of the truth so back to me showin out in public
thats a hotter subject
ive been whippin mercedes and nigga try to budget
i gotta make it back to memphis to check on my cousins

you know that if you wasnt you you would be dissin you dawg
damn okay from that perspective
i see what youre talkin bout no way to soften that
cause me i was tryna find out where i lost em at
but maybe i aint lose em at all
maybe i keep movin forward and theyre just stagnant they aint movin at all
but when they need a favor who do they call
maybe im searchin for the problems askin what was said and who was involved
too focused on peoples feedback and provin em wrong
they say the shoe can always fit no matter whose foot its on
these days feel like im squeezin in em
whoever wore em before just wasnt thinkin big enough
im bout to leave em with em
cause if i run in the game in these man the seams are splittin
no pun intended but theyre smellin defeat in the air
headed where nobody took it who meetin me there
they tell him that hes talkin crazy but he doesnt care
bein humble dont work as well as bein aware
