well anyway while i was cooling down at luigis
i met some siamese twins from overseaslebanese
lets begin with the friends from new orleans
they had a fifth friend  she was straight black-portuguese
pretty palm-olive-soaped skin aloe vera-lese
she looked like the type of chick you only see in fantasies
the type of chick you would kill for to get between the knees
yo  i made time to chill with miss portuguese
would you believe the bitch tried to steal my fucking house keys
and rob me for my gs
had to show this crazy broad i mastered my degrees and my phds

peace to the west coast and the east wes fam
need i make mention that the crew weve got
make things get hot like the fofo shot  blauw
no we dont promote no guns but dont turn that cheek
in the world that we live calmness is viewed as weak
so we got to stay awake for all these lizards and snakes
some of them come as friends; some of them come as jakes
we decipher all the force and build rounds with our friends
whys that

yo i fades them all like my man mally g
whip a nigga ass for free

im undefeated you can see my quantum leap
im hittin brothers where it hurt lyrical expert
those who got no publishing they need to get jerked no doubt

illegal maybe lethal like gibsons
splittin blessings with three weapons
lay in the cut like c-sections infestin the nine-six
for you mindless niggaz i smack spineless
or lay back like recliners as inject jewels
as flesh moves when in vaginas oooh oooh ooh ooh
corrupt your minors like new york citys finest
lineups on lsd fine dust in your sinus
crush like chinas opiumc grinders
my dust these rhymers i hijack like airliners
the infiltrator creator im sinful
papers stay viscous like religious cults
leaders that drop scriptures and rock clips or assault heaters
my flipmode niggaz were like afghanistan guerrillas

verse six busta rhymes

if you want more information look listen and read
while i sit back and i roll another fat bag of weed
we about to take control of your set like cruise control speed
satisfy my lyrical semen plants my johnny apple-seed
mental slave grip on your brain like white people
my music will dominate the population like black people
utilize my efforts to exercise my inner thoughts
i capitalize on my many and various styles of all sorts

school your army ya squad weak
remove four camps when i say
pumpin arms like nor plants

home sweet home down with monster control
still they in the cut like runnin the coal
and still we must bring the ruckus to all you motherfuckers
automatically assault and battery
we battle thieves that get tragically slap to sleep to relax the beef
collapse like weak cancerous lungs

blind feelin nap with jarred villain that alarm buildings
con scrimmage woke up a lot of children
dirty ass venom village

then pulls like men is the malk of method vanesha blinds 
by all means necessary i reach for mine and lift golden towers from roof tops
and give orders rugged pound acre 
drown violators in buckets of piss water

chorus 3xand im once again like to sincerely thank to everyone for taking time out to analyze this new lp and be eyewitness to another precious moment well spent with busta ryyyymess and the whole entire flipmode squaaaaaaaad and once again as we continue to keep you all motherfuckers posted theres only two years left from here to 1998 and i sincerely hope that all you motherfuckers are keepin in mind that there are absolutely no time to be taken time for granted we must all get wild now so that we can be show that we are someone capable of being qualified enough to contribute to our honor preparation for the final world front all my motherfuckers stay tuned for the next flipmode explosion until the next times set your shit and prepare fordaddy whats it going to be like in the year 2000

well sweetheart for your sake i hope itll be all peaches and cream but im afraid the endtime is near; the cataclysmic apacolypse refered to in the scriptures of every holy book known to mankind it will be an era fraught with boundless greed and corruption where global monatary systems disinigrate leaving brother to kill brother for a grain of overcooked rice the nations of the civilized world will collapse under the oppressive weight of parasitic political conspiricies which remove all hope and optimism from their once faithful citizins 

around the globe generations of polluters will be punished for their sins unshielded by the ozone layer they have successfully depleted left to bake in the searing naked rays of light wholesale assassinations serve to destabilize every remaining government leaving the starving and wicked to fend for themselves bloodthirsty renegade cyborgs created by tax-dodging corporations wreak havoc pissed off androids tired of being slaves to a godless and gutless system where the rich get richer and the poor get fucked over and out unleash total worldwide destruction by means of nuclear holocaust annihilating the terrified masses leaving in its torturous wake nothing but vicious cannibalistic mutated radiated horribly disfigured hoards of satanic killers bent on revenge but against whom there are so few left alive starvation reigns supreme forcing unlucky survivors to eat anything and anyone in their path

massive earthquakes crack the planets crust like a hollow eggshell causing unending volcanic eruptions the creatures of the seven seas unable to escape to certain death upon land boil in their liquid prison disease encircles the earth plagues of viruses with no known cause or cure laying waste to whatever draws breath

and human kind having proven itself to be nothing more than a race of ruthless scavengers fall victim to merciless attack at the hands of interplanetary alien tribes who seek to conquer our charred remains 

this is extinction level event the final world front and there is only one year left

wow thats cool i cant hardly wait

[busta rhymes]
just make sure them them drums is smackin

this means war

i work hard to take care of every one of my niggaz
feel the love and appreciation from all of my niggaz
when i think meditate and contemplate for my soul
watch the truth manifest once the story unfold
disloyal motherfuckers ima banish you all
and celebrate all in your absence once i get rid of yall
sometimes i cant describe the wicked shit i feel in my heart
break my silence and sporadically tear you apart
strike with a serious vengeance and before you die
put you through the worst and make you take a look in my eye
so you could witness the extreme damage caused by betrayal
make you sorry for the fact that you attempted and failed
make you eternally suffer you was one of my mens
turn your back on me and ima make sure you get it back times ten
stay true -- now thats the one thing i religiously pledge
if you aint wit me ima throw you way over the edge
this means war

[ozzy osbourne]
take a look inside
you can run and you can hide
if you cross my path
ill make sure you feel my wrath
give and you receive
cherish every breath you breathe
scriptures on the wall
those who betray all must fall

[busta rhymes]
as i cherish every blessing and i greet you with hugs
you my peoples when i see you i embrace you with love
yeah i be the one to come and get you out of the hole
yeah you be the one to run and leave me out in the cold
so amazing how many times you plot and you scheme
but what you dont realize youll never conquer my dream
though devilish karma cant penetrate the steel in my armor
time passed my oppression got you living with drama
paranoid of my retaliation living in fear
disloyalty will have me kill my brother sheddin a tear
such a shame how you could easily get trapped in a zone
and have to go to war with fake niggaz standin alone
until i get with all my loyal niggaz goin the length
dont matter how hard you try you never weaken my strength
now im with all of my loyal niggaz breakin the bread
and if you diss the code of honor we takin your head;
this means war

[ozzy osbourne]
take a look inside
you can run and you can hide
if you cross my path
ill make sure you feel my wrath
give and you receive
cherish every breath you breathe
scriptures on the wall
those who betray all must fall

nobody helps them
now he has his revenge

[busta rhymes]
whatchu gon do  whatchu gonna do
where you think you can run or you can hide
where you think you can run or you can hide
where you think you can run or you can hide
where you think you can run or you can hide

ima be the best to show love lets co-operate
disloyalty is somethin that we wont tolerate
deal with these niggaz lets put them where they properly go
on the island far away in a place where nobody know
so long fightin the bullshit for so many years
watchin the danger and niggaz double crossin they peers
yes i always fight for what is right and put my foot down
disrespect my love ima be layin you down
this means war

[ozzy osbourne]
take a look inside
you can run and you can hide
if you cross my path
ill make sure you feel my wrath

cherish every breath you breathe
scriptures on the wall
those who betray all must fallthe burial song repeated
-from heaven our gracious king-

though some of us have been poisoned
many of us have been blessed
and through the worst shit 
that we all as people go through
every blessing that we are blessed to have
are blessings that provide us with what makes us capable of withstanding
and makes us more powerful when we go through the worst shit
everything and every motherf**ker gets dealt with accordingly
mark my words

see i remember on the coming album
you know when there was only five years left
it was once said that there was no time 
to take time for granted
well we are now face to face with death any given time
theres only one year left motherf**kers 
1999 
the dawn of the new millenium

i understand though 
sometimes it takes time
and hands on extreme hardship experience
to realize how much better it is to prepare for the worst
by all means
it will always be better to be safe than to be sorry

so as we finally approach the year 2000
behold what it might have in store for us people
there have been many indications of changes
that will occur that has already occurred
that were not and will not be setup to our benefit as people
but in order for us to continue to build
we must destroy
and unfortunately in the process 
many of us will be liable candidates 
of being destroyed

but in the bigger scheme of things we must defend 
what we all collective identify with as the truth
and with what is right
to all my live soldiers 
and all my live women

those who may not survive the turning point
may you forever rest peacefully
as you are delivered back to the essence
so i dedicate this burial song to all of you

to my survival of the most fit for real niggas
and women no doubt
continue to get whats your from out this f**ker 
before your time run out

and my the force of survival forever rest with yall
my live motherf**kers
to all my survivalists
see you in the next thousand year period
allah bless all yall

flipmode continue to bounce
like a satellite in orbit
seein all you motherf**kers at every angle
the imperial the universal powerful flipmode squad

stay tuned

my nigga city bout to bounce on a trip
we met some niggas with alot of things they want em to flip
i told my nigga get the dough and keep the blau on your hip
travel safe you know that ima hold it down on the strip
good lookin word to mother son i give you my wit
but when i get back ima bounce straight to your crib
on the strength son slid until you to the greyhound
wit a burner in the knapsack headed straight outta town
now three days pass im still on the strip
doin hand to hand with twelve collapsible stashable clips
with little magnets on the side of the clips we planted like a project
when police come we stick the clips in any metal object
throwin a nigga on the walls and try to search me down
i laugh knowin that my stashll never be found
well anyway on the third day son came straight to the strip
wit a new floss and shiny shoes on the whip
my nigga hit me with the latest greatest
he told me get inside the whip so i can know just what the up to date is
he said he f**kin wit some guyanese niggas how ill them niggas is
what kind of dough they get and how they handle they biz
how they connect with jamaician niggas who speak american
and how they chains swung a medallion iced out pelicans
and how they stay wit four pounders
and speak american to try to blend in
like they aint obvious out of towners
okay ive never heard of workers gettin five gs pay
for trips that last for only 2-3 day
how these guyanese niggas be eatin pasta but they love zucchini
rockin valor tennis suits by sergio tecchini
them type of cats that call you because you cant call em
rockin baseball fitters with wild animal skins on em
how they rock silks and tailor made pants
and get a matching bally shoe for the silk to step in the dance
washrags hangin from every one of our back pockets
&gt;from every fine wine to champagne them niggasll straight cop it
and set up shops in them neighborhoods that was residential
rock laced whips while the workersll floss the latest rentals
how they f**k with arrogant bitches who act pussy
and love to hustle wit niggas and stash coke up in they pussy
after all of that i wanted ones
the way my nigga was talkin so next trip i went to bounce with son
so now we out of town with guyanese cats
up in they gates bubbling packages and layin wit gats
shit was slow until the main fiend was offed
just like a thief in the night
and spread the word that we was back with the white

intermission
ayo why dont you tell that crackhead to close the f**kin door
and shut the f**k up

the lookout niggas holdin fort like they was watchtowers

so on and so on shit is good and we eatin
first nigga to short a package will catch the most brutal beatin
the whole town see we now own it
carryin on and blemishing all in the hearts of the best moments
we stackin cheddar now and shit is all clear
and we was growin as workin niggas wit aspiring ideas
we love to floss and the feeling of pushing chrome shit
but in the grand scheme these niggasll love to have they own shit
now these niggas was really ready to swell up
we decided to separate from them niggas and make our shit develop
off in to the wilderness of the wicked husid
we set up shops and watched the games begin
so now we ballin like a motherf**ker money was sick
gas on the cheddar and these bitches ridin the dick
f**kin everything from the local mcdonalds bitches with the biggest ass
to attorney bitches thatll beat a charge fast
we used to takin niggas custies and leave they set up on tilt
and watch em angrily scheme on the shit that we built
aint it funny how shit transpire in fact
not too long after our ride we took the winners stash house was at
some niggas tried to run a jook with things in they palm
not a problem so immediately reach for the john
right away the gun bust straight lifted a nigga
how we moved his organs with kickback shifted a nigga
wild shots fire everybody scatter like rats
leavin nothing but gunpowder and a trail of smoke in these gats
now we got this faggot nigga blood on our hands
but f**k it determined to fulfill the best of these plans
shit was hot but we was nowhere near ready to fall
my son said he shot but he wasnt bleeding at all
word i started buggin when my nigga said he feel cold
then i looked up on the right side of his shirt and found a little hole
so as we continue to radically blaze the fifth
flame the iron not giving a f**k yall niggas wanna rip
well we deaded three out of the four niggas who tried to jook
one nigga slid and think he got off the hook
now let me find out one out of them three niggas we bodied
was one of them guyanese niggas who buy drinks up for the party
he was the nigga to flood the table with champagnes
stupid motherf**ker tried to front we had to leak his brain
suddenly my nigga fell to the floor
and said his legs feel like them shits aint got no feelins no more
more the actin up the more the shit i felt in my gut
the shit was all over as soon as the director said cut

thats a wrap good actin motherf**kers good actin

yeah this next joint right here
is dedicated to all my niggas that i love

thats that shit motherfuckers aint never seen 
nothing like this before for real man
its goin down baby uhh
uhh  busta rhymes
what  uhh dmx nigga
uhh uhh uhh uhh uhh

i see ghosts clearly; even though most dont hear me
they still wanna get near me - fear me so im leery
kinda eerie what im feelin - from the floor to the ceilin
straight through the roof want the truth
i kinda miss robbin and stealin
cause it kept a nigga hungry only eatin when i starved
i was ugly so i robbed no one loved me shit was hard
went to god once in a while when it got a little too hectic
he was the only one i knew that i respected why
didnt know why didnt know what i was livin was a lie
if i aint shit then why should i try
see plenty niggaz die over dumb shit up in the hood
real good heart but up to no good
thought i did what i could but i guess it wasnt enough
the devil told me it would happen but i kept callin his bluff
when it rains it pours now my pains are yours
as yours are whats mine define revolvin doors nigga

chorus busta rhymes

why all my niggaz tell me why tell me we die
cause we crazy with it quick to blaze you with it
from in my soul to every word that i curse
with all the agony expressed in this verse;
let me ask my niggaz why
my niggaz tell me why tell me we die
because we gods nigga and we go the yard nigga
because i walk the ground under my feet
and keep it live and stay in tune with the street
now let me ask my niggaz why

jay-z
they say the good die young in the hood where im from
i only got one question to that - why the fuck am i here
i look to the air i ask god love me please
but in reality only people that hug me is thieves
same niggaz that send shots through my rugby sleeves
they wanna slug me and leave im thinkin it must be me
please shed light the hoods dark
i did my dirt but got a good heart
shouldnt that count for somethin
i was told id amount to nothin most of my childhood
liked by folks it was stuntin my growth
seperated me from the shit i was wantin the most
felt myself comin close to pumpin them os
lump in my throat chest poked out face was poker
tryin to erase my ghostes chase the smokers
got demons on both shoulders 
tryin to chauffeur my life through the streets
in other words nigga my will was weak
please feel what i speak 
this aint your average ordinary jargon
weak rap niggaz be talkin
this shit is deep from the mind of busta x and me
to all my fallen soldiers rest in peace til we meet niggaz

chorus w/ minor variations

busta rhymes
i must be cuckoo like i respect the new-you never
see you too could get it through your fubu sweater
like a nigga when he walk in the dark trespassin
on a nigga land shots echo loud in the park
i live and die for all the shit i believe
and rep for everything i stand for 
with every single breath i breathe
like the intake from cigarette smoke its like you inhale
the demon in the gutter stressed struggled and broke
if the shit was all over tomorrow id leave a treasure
for my kids with a legacy for my children to follow
you know its funny how the good die first
get the peppin in your steppin faggot nigga
cause you could die worse
hold on you know i cut off my arm in the name of reppin
real niggaz in the midst of droppin this bomb
allah blessin me to rep for the better and carry on
somethin great and keep a nigga name livin forever

chorus w/ minor variationschorus
what this world is comin to to to
can you see see see see
whats in store for you for you you you you you you you

verse 1
yo right before i lay your soul to sleep
witness the day of your wreckin and wit god on the street
behold what the f**k yall niggas come around here for
we massacre the masses so therefore
heres your invitation to explore
the way we gather up niggas to thoroughly rep for
my street niggas cmon
stressed niggas cmon
hungry niggas cmon
yes yes yall cmon
hope my live motherf**kers pass the test yall
prepare for high retribution and i hope god bless yall bless yall
f**k shit up and watch the truth manifest yall fest yall
feel it in your guts and the burnin in your chest yall chest yall
pushin through just like a wild flood
with such a pain thats so intense it make yall wanna cry blood
my slang talk earned a scholarship from how to style a chick
influnce rulership and earn another dollar quick quick
you need to do the philisophical research
f**k around and be the next to die you better leave first
yo my whole crew extra large stay charged
like polytheism havin belief in many gods
i gotta handful of niggas wit a sick disease
die close to destructive anti-social tendencies
yo turn up the treble just a level
analyze the science deeper than when musa symbolized the devil


now let me ask yall

chorus
you are now in the current state of anarchy

verse 2
ha all hell break loose
yo we fight to the end and never call for a truce
yall niggas better pick and choose and select the battles wisely
always with the same approach and never once surprised me
ha however how clever
niggas is fighting for mad cheddar
yo cold like the wind blow in the winter
make you remember the torture like the frostbite that bit off your finger
this means war i said it before
adrenaline rush heart beat rapid sweat wet up the floor
try to threat and wanna battle me nigga
ima show you the major differnce between a dream and reality nigga
yo then i continuously hype up a nation
huddle wit my niggas plan for tomorrow go into isolation
and analyze how many niggas gon lose
tryin to squeeze they foot up in a pair of great man shoes
and analyze how we was needed to live
carry out my dooney give the most thanks and be appreciative
pass this to all my seeds after me
represent and fight to be that everything my seeds want me to be
the economy has been at its best to all my niggas hungry
lets keep weavin and magical methods of makin money
so ima rep at my fullest you cant spark me
and fight the hardest in the grim current state of anarchy

chorusyeah when i step in the spot motherfuckers say who that
big bun b but you already knew that
live from the state where they chop it and screw that
you hatin on the trill og where they do that for real
motherfuckers need to get off the dick man
fall the fuck back like a bike with no kickstand
get out my mix man just go get you stuck
deeper in the quicksand with no easy fix man damn
no tricks man those is for kids
cushion my cigar and hoes in the crib
drank and the twenty ounce froze in the fridge
you fuckin with da so you know what it is
im sittin on the fours that clack
comin down candy in the golden lac
we gettin to the money like its goldman sachs
and we do it for the pimps that are holding back lets go

look who crept in with automatic weapons
reppin qb till the death of him
that nigga that inspired lyrical tyrants like kanye west and em
track record goes back to the essence
smack adolescents who ask who the best is
im nasty like gas from a fat man attested
i pass it you gaspin for breath and you die fast
but im like a gastric bypass
bunch of nas african actors seemed to get typecast in the same role
since sixteen i aint grow a day old yet my brain grow
cocaine white range rov
tats on my body like an art exhibit
i did real good for a project nigga
was once a bacardi sipper now its chandon
fat blunts in the car with strippers
guns in compartments hidden
i was real young little youth a novice nigga
blessings bowed down respected
chowed down now my foods digested
pow pow with my shooters are techs
bust louder than the noise i just spit
lets get one thing straight that my crown aint for testin testin
chop heads off like king henry the eighth guillotine to ya neck bitch
im a king in this thing dont be dumb
been in this shit since ninety one
niggas cant fuck with the style i use
your fate is sealed no heidi klum
calm now was a wylin dude studied cowards that made power moves
watched wild planet seen lions devour food
you can say thats how i move
a monster nigga and i dont really like doing songs with niggas
there go my nigga wayne let them niggas hate
i love my nigga drake say we aint got time to respond to niggas

im a villain im a villain all that happens in the street
poverty and desperation made me everything i be
im a shotta when i pop up with them poppers burn ya block up
call the judges call the coppers we takin over gotham
word to poppa
blood gang five its that blood gang five
but green is the bottom line
i run this town i aint gon lie
they run they mouth they aint gon fight
they actin like they aint gon die
until i let them llamas fly
flatbush to bed-do-or-die
from watts to larry hoover chi
poverty and heroine its no place for a juvenile
put greed in our heart its the green that we want
cash money is the company and weezy the boss

they say im underrated but un-compete-with-able
understandable being that my rating levels are unreachable
anything said other than that should be silenced unspeakable
and the thought of you being nicer than me unfeasible
they ask is what i do ever gonna stop this shit will never end
thats when you hear a car crash in the vocal booth got em sayin
there he goes again
see now they nominated a nigga to come and flatten everything
now let me dominate it nigga run
and they be knowin that i be blackin on everything
and make it complicated like a nigga constipated with a gun
i gotta make it what they want and wake em when i come and shake em
and bake em and take em to another place
aint no fakin aint no kind of mistakin how i be breakin up
everything and be creating a s-s-s-situation when im done damn
you see i spit national treasure discography rich
and i done killed more cats than curiosity snitch
most of you niggas sorry and owe apologies quick
what the fuck you niggas still hangin around here for
you apostrophe bitch
ok now enough of that see now im out the door
tunechi thanks for giving us a whole nother classic
with tha carter ivyah-yah-yah-yah-yah-yah-yah-yah-yah-yah

hookbusta rhymes
yo me and my niggas and my clique be getting mad cream
balling the club now im drunk having a bad dream
this mothafucker tried to greet me with wealth
i never knew that i would see that day that i would meet the devil himself
this nigga was eagerly waiting to prove it
astonishingly already dancing to his own burial music
well anyway he plottin to do it to me
in a certain kind of way and started off directly popping shit to me
while he spoke a couple of fires would spark
while he sat in the shadow talking his shit we watch the sky getting dark he said

devil
 where it hurts
ill leave you in a  straight up leaking in the back of a church
let a ghosting crib and haunt you like a ghost in your home
leaving you old and crippet like them ruins in rome
watch your body shrivel up and turn your asses to smoke
fuck your flesh dont get yo blood sucked the blood of ya foes
i be that nigga thatll torture your spouse
and leave a thousand body bags like truthcom in front of your house

busta
got me bugging on a whole notha level
tell me how the fuck a nigga really end up having beef with the devil
shit bomb the whole effect the nigga had on my dreaming
body reacting mentally going to war with the demon
semi-chaotic like the typical storm
so embellished in the dream a nigga felt it in the physical form
the dream got my nose runny and shit
eyes watery shorty watching my body twitch funny and shit
giving shorty sleeping with me the creeps
she bugging off how a nigga just sweating and breathing so hard in his sleep
determined to conquer this nigga so let it begin
absolutely focused on killing the demon within
so now we fight in the name of my brethren
and every blow connect during the fight you can hear the thunder roll into heaven
aint hell a deep breath of fresh air
the devils presence blows a cold draft leaving a scent of death in the air
while my mind was reassembling now
simultaneous wifey watching a nigga body trembling now
couldnt conquer me so now the devil wanted me dead
stabbing a nigga with the same bone he ripped from his head
yo its funny how the devilsll test us
but if fully select niggas bless with something somell raggle with impressions
til im dead im always battling through
you cant believe you cut my main vein that all my blood be traveling through
somebody gotta die settle the score
because its me or this nigga im fighting to the death im ready for war
devil laughing fadesbaby
daddy can i sing this song please
thank you

hush other rap for niggas dont you cry
flip mode is back &amp; you are gonna die
now they are niggas &amp; they make it sound good
it can be alot safer when they move off the hood
its too late for you to try to call a truce
you tell him &amp; your nigga like the cipher on lose
better watch your head
you better watch how you talk
watch me sleep watch me walk
always beware of a choice you make
every time you click every route you take

fuck the fact that it cost the pricetag of the porche
will cost ya life have ya motha feel an immaculate loss
*breath* but of course come and speak to the best
and watch me spit a jewel sharper to carve the meat of your flesh
you lookin weak in the chest you see the street is a test
women on the stoop smokin holdin a seed to they breast
you see the street is a mess
strugglin holdin a couple pounds of weed then the rest
now i proceed to the rest of my niggas keepin it fresh 
though we must stay on the grind i supersceded the stress 
we always seem to finesse from the east to the west
you know we w-w-we keep the teflon from the street to the vest
kill that nigga slow like how you get defeated in chess
got you under pressure--hairline receaded effects
hot air niggas i only feel the heat from your breath 
rap niggas beef in they album probably needed the press
and as a man i never found the slightest need to impress
another man because im proud and i believe that im blessed
but yo i always found the need to adress these weaker niggas
that speak to the street always keepin the people abreast 
now youve been branded

chorus

verse 2 busta

i never quit watchin these niggas try to hide they mistake 
takin a shit watchin they body floatin by in the lake
make it quick you weak niggas better try to escape
and create the quickest way to reach the fire escape 
snitch niggas always quick to go and lie on a tape 
but its o-k cuz super hero niggas die wit a cape 
its so great to watch them finally break stand aside from the fake
street niggas gotta slide for the take
bein broke and not bein able to buy me a steak
stackin my paper so see now i can buy an estate 
so i rely on the love and i reply to the hate
so much pain in the struggle my whole bodyll achecome on

choruschorus
now this is the tale of a murderer who comes from the caucus cliffs
busta in background happy thanksgiving
he robbed and stole and killed for greed and packed us on slave ships
busta in background happy thanksgiving
he took us off to stolen lands it seemed like hell for sure
busta in background happy thanksgiving
with the crack and the guns death and disease they called for you and your
busta in background happy thanksgiving
no whips no brew no weed to smoke not a single luxury
if not for the bloodshed that it cost the struggle would be lost
busta say it again
the struggle would be lost
busta say it again
the struggle would be lost
busta say it again
the struggle would be lost
busta say it again
the struggle would be lost
busta say it again
the struggle would be lost

verse 1
the struggle will be lost
if you continue to do the shit you be doin with disloyalty nigga
now that explains why in each ward you avoiding me nigga
knowing now it takes nothing to be destroying a nigga
conditioned with a mind to shit on your brother
flossing with jewelry and whips just like a dick and still live with your mother
copping shit that superceded your salary 
where is your loyalty to your own blood and taking care of your family
funny how you sit and drink what you drink
thinking the foulest shit and not even knowing why you think how you think
must be the reason why we arent aware
because the devil know how guilty and filthy he is in all his affairs
fucking with my mind when i was a youngster
cause he know if we knew the truth wed make his ass run from amongst us
thats why we thinking that its better to ball 
while the devil be sitting and watching plotting how to murder us all
now this

chorus

verse 2
hey yo
thats why im hustling harder
now im in a huddle seeing the struggle in my mother and father
thats why my persona will come with such a karma to be getting this paper
cause i aint with the slavery labor 
a lot of niggas in the hood probly relate to me greater 
than those that believe when they die they going to meet the creator thats crazy
how we become slaves 
to mental death and power that comes with becoming even more of a dumber ass
the devil robbing you blind 
concealing the truth from niggas while we be struggling they murder the mind
the wickedness sneak on you quicker when they creep from behind 
continue to speak the truth til it weaken your spine
now check it
the jewel i give you be the beat the beat for the time
you cant see it like you living on a street for the blind
young whitty hustler niggas that stick with the grind
fly cuisine food poisoned cause you eatin the swine
i stay struggling and doin for delf
then i dig in my body deeper and do a little knowledge of self
they wonder why they catch a nigga on the weed sell
better be careful what you saying on them e-mails
now listen
they got your mind in a prison 
you can do whatever you want but focus if you desire to listen
as i say it i hope you feelin the wrath
create a hammer to make a man that a beat you in the head with the math 
now this

chorustill its gone

ey yo yo yo yo 
it was the first shine on the day of my birth i enterd the earth blind
funerabole to everything i would first find
condition of beating niggas having the wurst mind
becoming weak like we scavangers of the wurst kind
from having nothing to plot and makin the earth mine making the earth mine
thats kinda big aspirations for a nigga thats just kinda got on his first grind
but its aight cause im blowing hold on my first shine
kinda gas quiker than spas ready to burst mine
and thoug it seems like obstuckles come at the wurst time
going from being succesful to commiting the wurst crime
so quike like a bitch massaging ya whole dick and bustin up
and its over sabotagin ya own shit
we always good when we get it and then abuse and regret it
cause its quike as we get it we fucking lose it
thats what my mother used to tell me

chorus

seeing a flash that could take it from you like hocus-spocus
so count your blessings and baby i hope you stay in focus
wide awake like im drinkin cappucino mocus
takin on more stress and get to be come and smoke us
hhhee like the shit that the setup straight provoc us
and fall riped them to the shit till its lightfull and choke it
a promise you find thruth when you done diggin it out
stop the shiffering nigga i think id just figured it out
you see we thug visicily and mentally soft kep lies to yourself
so that your worth and value is lost 
sometime the feeling of the city is wrong
why we appriciet them all now tupac &amp; biggie is gone
somehow im seeing it clear i would have rather this value
them so much as both of these niggas is here yeah
we always good when we get it and then abuse and regret it
cause its quike as we get it we fucking lose it listen

chorus

yo thats what my mother used to always tell me
extend your hand for the worry and blessing if they need you
never take life fore granted and bite the hand that feeds you
be causios how you treath people and how the people feel you
respect niggers or else the karmarus is coming to kill you
you got it good baby just get your shit together
before you lose it and its over and gone forever
dressed for the stormy weather feel the songs
for everyone is personal like i was just writing myself a letter

struggled to get visas &amp; green cards through immigration
though my pop was po stayed away from crime &amp; malice
hard livin gave him hard hands &amp; callous
as a youngn peep how much they loved each others space
his hard hands rubbin against the pretty skin of my mothers face
dig for treasure til his hands looked like hands of a junkie
so coarse slap a mule and take the life from a donkey
on the other hand mommy was the type to work 2 jobs
never enough money thats why i got your whole crew robbed
got older developed ways of grippin the steel
barely home for me to see her or get a good cooked meal
seek refuge in the alleged land of the free lookin
blendin in with city folk down in flatbush brooklyn

thats why we stay up on the block gettin money while we keepin it safe
in front of churchgoers keepin the faith

and fall in love with the hood til somebody come blast the heat

see the niggaz on the corner and i never forget it
and i never regret because i see how you get it
now because of you niggaz im a hustler nigga
gnac guzzler nigga rip your jugular nigga
in the night i become the type to love when its dark
cause when i pull up and park is when im makin my mark
see the facts that im tryin to strive and capitalize in
start to max-a-mimize and b-build a ent-ter-prise
and wh-while im stockin this bread keep ah-stockin the lead
and leave a permanent dot on the top of your head

i love to fold up a knot love totin the glock
helps me feel safer when niggaz try to scheme on my plot
try to steal paper from me you gotta deal with a lot
see i will leave you to rot only defendin my stock
niggaz know they pussy and struggle to pretend that they not
lose your life in the drop while i harvest the crop
my hot shit; bust a cannon have you run in your socks
see we live on the edge bang shit with a sledgehammer
split up your head kill a snitch for the feds

[chorus]feat mr porter

[mr porter]
im just playin wit yall niggaz im just playin wit yall niggaz
im just playin wit yall niggaz im just playin wit yall niggaz

they told me to [echoes]

[chorus mr porter]
they see my name and lifestyle and say i changed how i be so raaawww
they so cold i know that theyre out to get me
and alllll those people i call my friends let it gooooooooo
thats why i never call on yall to be around
cause you see how this monnneeeyyy can change your friends faaaiiittthhh

[busta rhymes]
geah see i done came a long way and now i got me a chauffeur
keep my enemies close keep my friends even closer
muhfuckers that i grew around thought i could rock wit em
watch my cake so hard they burn a hole in my pocket
i see em coming from afar because i been through so much shit
they plot a lot hard or not they see my dough come quick
invested in my niggaz took the realtor route
gambled on the wrong niggaz had to filter em out
type of dudes that see my mother and they greet her respectful
behind her back and see her son and try to give me a quick full
its cool though i fucks wit em even though i aint wit it
thats why the gats be in the house whenever niggaz come visit
serve em drinks and welcome all to the law
for let ya drunk friend to show his true side until ya forced to cut him off
i seen it one too many times they disbelieved and they speechless
sometimes having certain friends can end up being a weakness
see now my dogs turn to wolves and try to front me and surround me
come up out they sheepskin and act all different around me

[chorus]

[busta rhymes]
listen sometimes i smoke a cigarette and then i think and i choke on
how niggaz steal this funny style and i was struggling broke
even though it dont surprise me shit its still kinda funny
when i aint have a nigga still would come and try to take from me
instead of cutting my losses being smart and just end shit
niggaz was trying to be loyal just to maintain a friendship
in the wrong situation plus theres always a sequel
im with the wrong muhfuckers plus they pose to be peoples
as i get more money days get colder
i learned to realize that power only lies in the hands of the beholder
so then i start the heart-on-my-heart as i walk like a soldier
moving so militant you think i had a chip on my shoulder
living by morals and principles mainly
having heavy thoughts to a kill a brother every time a fucker betrayed me
but now im winning with the strength of the nation
i promise that they not even foreseeing the size of the shit theyll be facing
im aftermath now shits getting worse
now when those same friends see me goin hard that shit be making em hurt

[chorus]

[busta rhymes]
instead they getting together with me so we both can get rich
when im outta town these niggaz busy tryna fuck with my bitch
same niggaz spend they money til the shitll diminish
i hit em off and turn around and come right back when it finish
i said im tired of these niggaz thatll owe me so much shit
that they cant pay me back for fuck all the dumb shit
sometime we cant forgive whatever balances off
specially when niggaz cross the line that niggaz never should cross
realized and thus i state the same shit get the range
the more money niggaz get shit around you will change
even though niggazll flip and say he the one changed
fuck you the dudell justll justify takin his shit from you
the more money i get i get more dangerous stupid
cause i been broke before and i refuse to go back to it
and while i sweep these niggaz up under the rug with a broom
if i never see these friends again that shitll be too soon
shit is real like every wind in my breath
and thats on everything i love blood of my blood flesh of my flesh

i dig graves for niggaz like you
we gon get more acquainted at a time when you least expect it

[chorus 2x female singer]
do you ever think do you ever think
what life would be what life would be
where you will go where will you go
after you die after you die

[death] you fucked up nigga

[busta rhymes]
you know that when that time comes and nobody is checkin
and everything you had is gone in the split of a second
thats when it starts hittin the fan and it gets real in this bitch
just face the fact your shits a wrap and you gotta deal with the shit
despite i talk about it i aint makin fun of them niggaz
i give thanks cause ive been blessed and i aint one of them niggaz
cant imagine how difficult it is i know you suspect
that shit around you is lookin dumb its gettin hard to accept it
alone in the mirror you look at yourself and you smile
disregarding the fact your runnings been done for a while
refuse to acknowledge the truth like the mind of a child
continue frontin like its nothin while you live in denial
while all your people around you start to leave you in the same place
you overexert the little you have left to save face
you tryin to hide your expression from lookin worried
on what to do when your career is buried

[chorus]

[busta rhymes]
niggaz aint givin a fuck about your flows no more
you aint the star you were fuckin the same hoes no more
promoters aint payin and bookin you for shows no more
you aint whippin the range you aint whippin a rolls no more
reality starts to settle in youre sweatin every wake up
youre broke and now you gotta return your jewelry to jacob
you run around and you front like youre still on fire
but nobody believes you; and now you live as a liar
youre onnly lyin to yourself cause its evident in the proof
as your world continues to crumble come to terms with the truth
youre still holdin on to them days when everything was about you
but niggaz dont even remember you enough to just shout you
i remember when you did your thing without a doubt tastefully
the problem was you didnt know when to bow out gracefully
once told never burn out its best to fade away
preserve your value so that you can live to see a greater day
people see you and its bugged that you mean nothin
you doin shit and front to prove to people you mean somethin
it happens in the vicious when the truth starts to settle in
you step to the door of the club and see that you aint gettin in
forgettin you a man first chasin the fame
got to remember morals and principles reppin your name proper
but most niggaz dont and they whole life hurried
what do you do when your career is buried

[chorus]

[death; portrayed by busta rhymes + busta rhymes]
okay
i told you we was gonna get more acquainted
at a time when you least expect it nigga
im here to lay you to rest once and for all [coughing]

instead of bein all peaceful the partially thugs be spreadin like cancer
frontin like gangsters until you bust their head and they lookin like dancers
while they leanin and the rockin with after
you couldve avoided beef this shit is annoying cheif
cause now you got the bouncer stoppin the door

someone you know that knows you and gives you motivation 
someone that you can go to and vent your frustration 
we always talk about our peeps how we be everywhere 
when you need ‘em the most are they really ever there 
see  every thing be all good when we be havin’ fun 
the difference is really needing a friend than having one 
it’s good when your peoples are there to help your problems 
and help you smile about it while finding a way to solve it 
look at hear let me keep it at 100 and let me tell ya 
how you hold me down is something i genuinely value 
i got a clearer view and being that you’re always here for me i’ll be here for you 

i made a decision despite all the things that we go thru 
i’m going to take more time with you and be a friend indeed 
i made a decision that everything will be alright 
going to stay strong and keep it tight i’ll be there indeed 

well how you been baby but i’m sayin’ 
even though we probably link up every now and then 
with minimal convo look it’s real good to see you friend 
something that we allow that i don’t even have to mention 
is whether or not you got me that’s something that i never question 
sometimes i feel that the people that i love don’t appreciate me 
and some hate to see the shit i’ve been going through lately 
see you was here when it started to haywire 
you’re still here walkin with me going thru the fire 
and i really love you for it i know you all relate too 
on everything that i believe and i appreciate it you 
and just for that it don’t matter you can put that on my name 
the way you rep me let me be there just for you the same 
sometimes the pressure and the pain it be wearin’ me out 
but i thank you for just bein’ there and for hearin’ me out 
i got a clearer view i thank god that you’re here for me and i’m here for you 

i made a decision despite all the things that we go thru 
i’m going to take more time with you and be a friend indeed 
i made a decision that everything will be alright 
going to stay strong and keep it tight i’ll be there indeed 

i look in your eye and i see the pain in it 
life’s a game maybe the game did it 
i know i changed they say the fame did it 
life’s changed maybe the game did it 
two friends now in two different places 
and the mister catchin’ planes and you catching cases 
friendship we never based it on position 
no matter the game we both shared the same vision 
decisions to split us in the place that life seemed to hit us 
i would come to town and never get up with you 
around then things weren’t so simple 
i had my own issues that i was trying to get through 
outside chatter messing with our mental 
on the chase of  trust you can’t forget to 
it’s the real friends that you’ve got to tend to 
no matter how far just know that i’m with you 

i made a decision despite all the things that we go thru 
i’m going to take more time with you and be a friend indeed 
i made a decision that everything will be alright 
going to stay strong and keep it tight i’ll be there indeed 

i made a decision[busta rhymes]

now shorty breathin all heavy hands all on me
then she turn around and try to put her ass on me
i aint payin no mind
til i seen her crew waitin on the soul train line
now shorty workin hard tryin to get with me
wanna take me to the bathroom tryin to give me quickie
but i aint trickin on em like my name tricky
when they smell my cologne they wanna try to give me hickie
like kissin and huggin and suckin on my wrist full of diamonds
move slow ill tuck your little chick in my pocket
type of shit i do all day
like the last broad to the show stay okay

[chorus]ladies and gentlemen are you ready
yea
are you ready to make some noise
put your hands together
i want everybody in here to stand up on your feet
turn my music up
to make some noise
to make some noise
to make some noise
i want everybody in here to stand up on your feet
aye where’s spliff at
there’s about to be a problem now nigga

once i captured the soul of the street it’s so hard for me to let go
respect down at the techno hear the stadium echo
now it’s reaching a vile when the weakness is silent
putting the fear of god in ‘em while i’m shifting the climate
the gladiator presence everything about me giant
this the year of the dragon with a heart of a lion
got ‘em throwin’ their swag up how i come to provide it
now we makin’ ‘em riot till we makin’ ‘em try it
you can never deny it how i came to prescribe it
then bangin’ with the ship like earth and jupiter collided
then i came i’m remindin’ em of how the spark ignited ‘em
and conquered continents the size of easy times five of ‘em
and while i ride for them you think it’s loud to them
i give pride to them and get it rough with them
i hate the street that with you it smell like earth burn
i captivate ‘em with my first words everybody

shout shout i’m talking to you
to make some noise
to make some noise
to make some noise
to make some noise

holla back to applyin’ the pressure
bother your corner stretcher hot like a lot of pepper
most of you niggas off cotton and polyester
you know how i know all legend like robert nesta
you know i’m out to get you take all the robs count
and power to the billies couple cigar lounge
see how i make it pop knockin’ them all down
watchin’ them all drown this how the love sound
your swag off you know you really need to look around
and try to find it nigga searchin’ the lost sound
but i welcome the hate my mother prayin’ for me
got too much money to count my niggas winnin’ for me
let me appraise you closely
they can’t believe the way we busted up like it’s not the problem is we just playin’ homie
and when we in the spot there won’t be no delayin’
only to collect another trophy now the haters say it for me

shout shout i’m talking to you
to make some noise
to make some noise
to make some noise
to make some noise

shout shout i’m talking to youi got whatever i signed
you wanna hop in bitch comin on

my little fingers in the sky
screamin fuck a hater til the day a nigga die

yea i got em yellin oh god lord
presence fresh your neck rise sharp tom ford
fuck g4s i charter private concords
and she through the sky like missiles when they dodge ball
toast them bottles with the booze

when you think we smell funny certain niggas wanna watch em
when it comes to money im a nose fragrance watch the flower blossom
when it comes to bread yall niggas know its me
i articulate beautiful like a poetry
hoes bring me that paper just like they all in 3s
chip em a revenue god bless my rosaries

oh my lord

theres a light contagiousness to this tirade
it just might make you sick
so irate with this my brain is just like a fucking fried egg
is my mind scrambled im lit yes narrow minded
but go through such a wide range of this emotion
that my rage has gotta squeeze through it sideways
i just pulled up in clive davis driveway
with his personal memoir saying hes bi
waving a nine a picket sign yanking his ride making him cry rape then arrive naked
and drive straight through the gay pride parade yippee-ki-yay
cause here i- wait did the world just pee on my leg
and should i take it as a sign maybe ill take em back in the times shady
stuck out like a sore thumb so i gave em the finger
to take the attention away from my stinking face it was bringing
changed the whole complexion of the game but just in case you was thinking
an inkling of replacing the kingpin youre crazy youre wasting your ink then
so if this is any indication of what you may be facing
you better make a distinction cause you fake imitations
are leaving a bad taste fuck making a bad impression
thats the worst impersonation ive ever seen and
who raps nasally eyes hazily rhymes crazily
but sounds like he may need some flo nasally speaking
what kind of stupid question is that
hey mrs abraham lincoln
other than your husbands fucking brains that were leaking howd you think that play was this weekend
you aint the real slim shady sit your ass down faggot
see me on a ballot im running for class clown
rich democrat bitch so im just a candidate
to come fuck up the whole party me and flipmode starting a campaign
to have every campus on a fucking rampage
act my goddamn age i am eight so lets get smashed
and wake up the next day with the room trashed covered in band-aids
glass ashtray smashed champagne splashed on the lampshades
but this aint up for debate this is undebatable
shady for president ho dont make me go take it back to the days of old
where sway and tech radio when i was taking so much nodoz and lsd
i almost fell asleep on the wake up show
fuck you telling me fools i was living shock
raising hell up in shoes when penelope cruz was still developing boobs
me and bus put it down like a sick pet
youre fucking with vets dawg fucking internet bloggers
i sit in front of my computer all day and comment on
everything im an expert on everything everything sucks play the next song
guess if i hopped out your freaking laptop you idiot prick
with biggie and kicked the living shit out of you id be dead wrong
son of god im not soft like a wet log force never gets clogged
im so full of self-esteem that i sweat fog
yes yes y’all steady on the left y’all
step off of it or you get stepped on soft
bout as commercial as my fucking leo jet
jealously’ll get you as green as a geopet
i can see that you’re visibly upset dawg
alert alert girl alert
once you went into the house of pain hearing a world of hurt so
jump around jump jump get that ass shaking
jump around jump jump came to hit you with a fan favorite
but if you too fly for coach better get them get them arms and freaking hands flailing
jump like van halen and pray for a damn tailwind
more afraid of success than i am of failure
so what does that tell ya
that on a grand scale i don’t give a fuck about nothing like stan mailing
his last piece of fan mail before he ran straight into the damn railing

chill man chill
