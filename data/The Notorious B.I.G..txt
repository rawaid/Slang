slugs in his back and thats what the fuck happens
when you sleep on the street
little motherfuckers with heat want ta leave a nigga six feet deep

verse three

if i wasnt in the rap game
id probably have a key knee deep in the crack game
because the streets is a short stop

i used to read word up magazine
salt n pepa and heavy d up in the limousine
hangin pictures on my wall

with the hat to match
remember rappin duke duh-ha duh-ha
you never thought that hip hop would take it this far
now im in the limelight cause i rhyme tight

stereotypes of a black male misunderstood
and its still all good

cause youre the only one ill give you good and plenty

when i was dead broke man i couldnt picture this
50-inch screen money green leather sofa
got two rides a limousine with a chauffeur
phone bill about two gs flat
no need to worry my accountant handles that
and my whole crew is lounging
celebrating every day no more public housing
thinking back on my one-room shack
now my mom pimps a ac with minks on her back
and she loves to show me off of course
smiles every time my face is up in the source
we used to fuss when the landlord dissed us
no heat wonder why christmas missed us
birthdays was the worst days
now we sip champagne when we thirst-ay

selling drugs to all the losers mad buddha abuser
but they dont know about your stress-filled day

she was forced to kick me out no doubt
then i figured out licks went for twenty down south
packed up my tools for my raw power move
glock nineteen for casket and flower moves
for chumps tryin to stop my flow
and what they dont know will show on the autopsy
went to see papi to cop me a brick
asked for some consignment and he wasnt tryin to hear it
smoking mad newports cause im due in court
for an assault that i caught in bridgeport new york
catch me if you can like the gingerbread man
you better have your gat in hand cause man

i dont wanna live no mo
sometimes i hear death knockin at my front do
im livin everyday like a hustle another drug to juggle;
another day another struggle

i dont wanna live no mo

with my man two-tecs to take over this projects

your destiny is somethin you can never figure out
niggaz is never happy til theres blood up in your mouth
theres a lot of killers but who the hell are you to play in this
a lot are dead how the hell you take the pain
live with it got money you better get with it
my man had the thug in him did his bid with it
get married to the game but never have a kid with it
advice from the wise slice the pies
too many schemes divides when dreams collide
teams provide war for the street to absorb
stashed in the ceiling and you slept on the floor
only a blind dovell fall in love with a whore

notorious big
uhh uhh uhh
who the fuck wanna squeeze
my desert ease make mcs freeze
you wakin up in cold sweats they just dreams
you still apoligizin analyzin my size and your size and
realizin a fist fight would be asinine

genuine steel piece nozzle in your grill piece
youre shook up two bricks every cook up
we can hook up all i see is the future
disrespect i shoot ya
by the way them bricks get flipped weekly
sold by soldiers that mix weed with the leak leak
die for a dollar nigga life aint sweet
play for keeps wet shirts with experts on the creep
i be the mob fiance about to marry it
illegal transactions in farragut with arabics

rule nombre uno never let no one know
how much dough you hold cause you know
the cheddar breed jealousy specially

your momsll set that ass up properly gassed up
hoodie to mask up shit for that fast buck

number four know you heard this before
never get high on your own supply
number five never sell no crack where you rest at
i dont care if they want a ounce tell em bounce
number six that god damn credit dead it
you think a crackhead payin you back shit forget it
seven this rule is so underrated
keep your family and business completely seperated

find yourself in serious shit
number eight never keep no weight on you
them cats that squeeze your guns can hold jobs too
number nine shoulda been number one to me

chorus repeat to fadeas a child christopher was outspoken when it suited him at times he was quiet 
and of course he was mischievous as all little boys are as a young man he likes 
to do everything he liked to read he likes to be with his friends as young kids 
r young boys he enjoyed life everything that would make him happy r comfortable 
he would do but mostly he enjoyed being with his friends and family his early 
inspirations toward rap music were the lls of the world the sugar hills the mr 
magic抯 and the fat boys of the rap channel those were all the things i heard in 
the house even though i called it noise and banging i know now that it is a 
accepted musical art form i was a single parent i raised my son on my own his 
father had no influence on his decision towards the musical outlet r career he 
chose my son had a mind of his own even if his father was around he would have  
turned to rap he loved music he loved rap at a point in my sons life he 
developed paranoia about death and about the dying we are living in a world of 
im
perfect human beings we are  greed jealousy and envy or manifested by what 
others have accomplished in life  my son was very very much aware of that he 
appreciated his station in life on the directions in which he was going  are  
traveling on the other hand there were others who i should uhh use the hip hop 
phrase player hating and i think that is what resulted in his paranoia if i had 
to change anything in my sons life that would  have allowed him to be here 
today i would have deterred him from a career in music im aware that millions 
appreciated his music millions loved his music be that it may if he hadn抰 
chosen that life style that career my son would be alive today if i could sum 
up christopher  in one word the word would be generous th thing that my  son 
loved most about life was the fact that he was in a position  to help position 
to share position to give to others who needed to others who wanted to others 
apreciat4d the gifts that he gave that抯 what he loved mostjamaican host

were gonna ask you for some fanfarethe band fanfare becauseladies and gentlemensting has always gone ahead of itself

my back dont bend see papi is my kenfolk
spin out the work as if its on a ten spoke
soul benefactor the benz he made the rims poke
trust me they cant touch p in one touchie
turn drop-head coupe to dune-buggy
admire the verses their inspired by the hearses
that carried my niggaz and had the church mothers cursing
imagine the glamour that comes out the flow
of a nigga who still play in the snow like santa
the wrist is rushing my ears is blushing
and the diamonds in my chain big as grandmas buttons yes
on the flipside the steel im gripping
you thought all the floss had me slipping
think again blink again let me know that your bluffing
lead give permanent concussion your nothing

chorus

malice
ha ha ha ha ha check out the fisad
on the face of rap so we gon raise the bar
a mil on the crib mean a quarter on the car
bentley coupe another short of the arnage
even as a youth i was laudering the stoop
underneath the nose and the feds had no clue
i was pushing keys in a v with no roof
rich black two big guns and no coof
things at the label well they tend to get unstable
and that pretty much leave malice at the table
or over the stove with the flame to the ladle
because im a provider as long as i am able
this here hughe the most foolish of blues
when i tell my mom the price
she damn near sent me to my room
its the m-a-l-i-c-i-o-u-s
