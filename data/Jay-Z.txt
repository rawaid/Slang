in all possible ways know the feds is buggin my life
hospital days reflectin when my man laid up
on the uptown high block he got his side sprayed up
i saw his life slippin this is a minor set back

that made him smile though his eyes said pray for me
ill do you one better and slay these niggaz faithfully
murder is a tough thing to digest its a slow process

said she had dreams a sniper hit me with a fatal shot
those nightmares mom

but these mils make me hot yall dont feel me
enough to stop the illin right
but at the same time these dimes keep me feelin tight 
im so confused
ok im gettin weeded now i know im contradicting myself
look i dont need that now 
it just once in a blue when theres nothin to do and
the tension gets too thick for my sober mind to cut through
i get to zonin me and the chick on the l and then were bonin
i free my mind sometimes i hear myself moanin
take one more toke and i leave that weed alone man
it got me goin shit

chorus x3dear god i wonder can you save me
illuminati wants my mind soul and my body
dear god i wonder can you save me
secret society tryin to keep an eye on me
dear god i wonder can you save me
illuminati wants my mind soul and my body
dear god i wonder can you save me

this shit is wicked on these mean streets
none of my friends speak
were all trying to win but then again
maybe its for the best though cause when theyre seeing too much
you know theyre trying to get you touched
whoever said illegal was the easy way out couldnt understand the mechanics
and the workings of the underworld granted
nine to five is how you survive i aint trying to survive
im trying to live it to the limit and love it a lot
life ills poison my body
i used to say fuck mic skills and never prayed to god i prayed to gotti
thats right its wicked thats life i live it
aint asking for forgiveness for my sins endz
i break bread with the late heads picking their brains for angles on
all the evils that the gamell do
it gets dangerous money and power is changing us
and now were lethal infected with devils

dear god i wonder can you save me
illuminati wants my mind soul and my body
dear god i wonder can you save me
secret society tryin to keep an eye on me
dear god i wonder can you save me
illuminati wants my mind soul and my body
dear god i wonder can you save me

we used to fight for building blocks
now we fight for blocks with buildings that make a killing
the closest of friends when we first started
but grew apart as the money grew and soon grew black-hearted
thinking back when we first learned to use rubbers
he never learned so in turn im kidnapping his babys mother
my hand around her collar feeding her cheese
she said the taste of dollars was shitty so i fed her fifties
about his whereabouts i wasnt convinced
so i kept feeding her money til her shit started to make sense
who could ever foresee we used to stay up all night at slumber parties
now im trying to rock this bitch to sleep
all the years we were real close
now i see his fears through her tears know shes wishing we were still close
dont cry it is to be
in time ill take away your miseries and make em mine devils

dear god i wonder can you save me
illuminati wants my mind soul and my body
dear god i wonder can you save me
secret society tryin to keep an eye on me
dear god i wonder can you save me
illuminati wants my mind soul and my body
dear god i wonder can you save me

my flesh no nigga could test
my soul is possessed by devils in the form of diamonds and lexuses
the exorcist got me doing skits like homie
you dont know me but the whole world owe me
strip
was thought to be a pleasant guy all my fucking life
so now im down for whatever aint nothing nice
throughout my junior high years it was all friendly
but now this higher learning got the remy in me
liquors invaded my kidneys
got me ready to lick off mama forgive me
i cant be held accountable devils beating me down boo
got me running with guys making gs telling lies that sound true
come test me i never cower
for the love of money son im giving lead showers
stop screaming you know the demon said its best to die
and even if jehovah witness bet hell never testify devils

dear god i wonder can you save me
illuminati wants my mind soul and my body
dear god i wonder can you save me
secret society tryin to keep an eye on me
dear god i wonder can you save me
illuminati wants my mind soul and my body
dear god i wonder can you save meyo whats up everybody

when it boils to steam it comes to it
we all fiends gotta do it even righteous minds go through this
true this history school us to spend our money foolish
bond with jewelers and watch for intruders

recruited lieutenants with ludicrous dreams of
gettin cream lets do this against t-d-s

funny thing happens when years of chasing money unfolds
and the only thing worse than getting old is not getting old
niggaz stay low like six bowls of shit and gold 
and watch for hoes with form fitting clothes
and i hope you shine
see many wrinkles and enough memories to last you two lifetimes

moans turn to hollers and screams as we zone like a college team
then they can hear you from hollis queens 226

chicks in your ear kickin dirt cause you got hotter rings
but you know how to scream friends talking dizziness

in first class if my ass should crash champagne spilled on me
steaks still warm on me

chorus #2 singing

verse three

ever since you retired working alongside those live wires

these rap dudes can flip but some of them aint even rhyming for chips
what part of the game is this
seems brainless on tours with whores thats what im saying i miss
cats that go all out for their gold plaques
starting out with four jacks ended up with gold acs

on the weight of me through you screw you
gun blew you i didnt want to choose you

choruslook if i shoot you im brainless
but if you shoot me then youre famous -- whats a nigga to do
when the streets is watching blocks keep clocking
waiting for you to break make your first mistake
cant ignore it thats the fastest way to get extorted
but my time is money and twenty-five i cant afford it
beef is sorted like godiva chocolates
niggas you bought it i pull the slide back and cock it
plan aborted you and your mans get a pass
this rhyme youre operating on bitch time
yall n*ggaz aint worth my shells all yall niggas
tryin to do is hurt my sales and stop trips to john mcnale
the type to start a beef then run to the cops
when i see you in the street got one in the drop
when id rather be on tour getting a hundred a pop
or taking pictures with some b*tches in front of the drop
the streets is watching

*chorus*
when the streets is watching
blocks keep clocking
waiting for you to break make your first mistake
cant ignore it

man its hard not to kill niggas
its like a full time job not to kill niggas cant chill
the streets is watching you when you froze your arms
niggas wanna test you and your gun goes warm
cant get caught with your feet up gotta keep your heat up
sweet niggas running round swearing shit is sweeter
once youre tagged lame the game is follow the leader
everybody want a piece of your scrilla so you gotta keep it realer
kidnap niggas wanna steal ya
broke niggas want no cash they just wanna kill ya
for the name niggas dont know the rules
disrespectin the game want you to blow your cool
force your hand of course that mans plottin
smarten up the streets is watching its on

*chorus*

my street mentality flip bricks forever know me and money
we like armed co-defendants nigga we stick together
shit whatever for this cheddar ran my game into the ground
hustle harder to see if indictment time came around
now you can look up and down the streets and i cant be found
put in twenty-four hour shifts but niggas mouths got slow leaks
had to hide between my workers couldnt play those streets
stay outta space like mercury you jerkin me hectic
had to call upon my wolves to send niggas the message
i said this lets play fair and we can stay here
im trying to transform you boyz ii men like daycare
hey theres money to be made and niggas got the picture
stopped playing with my paper and we got richer
then hard times fell upon us half of my staff
had warrants the other half in the casket lay dormant
i felt like life was cheating me for the first time
in my life i was getting money but it was like my conscience was eating me
was this a lesson god teaching me was he saying that
im playing the game straight from hell from which few came back
like bad coke pimp or die was my mindframe bad
was niggas was thinkin simplify was turnin cocaine crack/
aint a whole lot of brain to that just trying to maintain a stack
and not collide like two trains thats on the same track
fore i get my life together like the oars i bring back
in the bottom of the pot where no water gets hot
got my transporter take it cross the border then stop
set up shop with a quarter of rock heres the plan
for three straight weeks niggas slaughtered the block
but you know the game is lluted that fucked up me and my dues
one drop can wipe a nigga out faster than the cops
and this unstable way of living just had to stop
half of my niggas got time we done real things
by ninety-four became the subject of half of yall niggas rhymes
public apoligies to the families of those caught up in my shit
but thats the life for us lost souls brought up in the shit
the life and times of a nigga mind excited with crime
and the lavish luxuries that just excited my mind
i figured shit why risk myself i just write it in rhymes
and let you feel me and if you dont like it then fine
the mindstate of a nigga who boosted the crime rate
so high in one city they send national guards to get meim done talking
ran up in the spot gun smoking
shot it in the air one woke him
sun-soaking sweating in his bed like dunlo
thinking to himself what done provoked him
his thoughts is racing like a vulcan
i swear i saw a lightbulb when
he finally figured out who was the culprit
i said yeah remember me from friend or foe when
i told you dont ever ever come around here no more
time to pay now you try to rise i wave the gun - lay down
this time youre really going to listen to jay now
i try to talk sensibly hoping that eventually you realize
i had this locked and it just wasnt meant to be
plus i had sympathy when we all wore rams with your keys
and it wasnt afterthought that maybe youll try to revenge me
but i was like nah chromes had to know he was wrong
and if you caught me on the foul now you would sing me the same song
plus you promised
and thats really no fun 
yeah i find you in this motel 6 with all these guns
and all your goons lined up in adjoining rooms
like some wild cowboys coming to get me at high noon
but my minds like a flower in bloom
*** my eyes just scower the room
im alert plus i paid the clerk i got it laid out
you think you the first nigga i played out in a 2 hotel town 
come on now i peep your lexus at you
left the exit got some niggas on that side of the town
money well invested rudely interrupted
jamaican accents *** 
a gun in your face and thats all you can come up with
im done talking back up and clap them one in the abdomen 
do me a favor dude get 2 ice cubes i pass them
take that ice up for the nicest mc
and please yo tell big hes unbelievable 
friend or foe biotchhow can you fairly ask something from the outside looking in
theres gotta be them times youll be wrong  nah mean
how can a mother fucka go round a hate a nigga
he never even met that he dont even know and shit
i think this rap shit is all beef

yall dont even know everyday im livin with stress
got up out the streets you think a nigga could rest
cant even enjoy myself at a party unless
im on the dance floor hot ass vest
you think im freakin these chicks right
itry not to brush against they chest
you get a lawsuit for shit like that i feel trapped
swear to everything when i leave this earth
its gon be on both feet never knees in the dirt
you could try me fucka but when i squeeze it hurts fine
well lose two lives yours and mines
gimme any amount of time dont let ms carter grieve
at the funeral parlor drippin tears on my sleeve
told the judge didnt budge it was him or me
and i aint trying to be hard but im guilty as charged
put my mercy on this court and my faith in god 
and pray hard none of my nephews wanna be starslucky me

[chorus karen anderson]

you only know what you see 
you dont understand what it takes to be me

i hate all girls with alterior motives
thats why im twenty plus years old no sons no daughters
hate putting my life in the hands of fake promoters
hear the hate in my voice right i hate that you noticed
niggas wanna strip to the bone for shit you own
hate a nigga like that faggot get your own
hate that i cant roam the street without the clip and chrome
knowing one day ima have to flip cmon
you know the shit dont stop til the crist dont pop
and you have to kill a nigga and your wrist dont lock
im trapped the whole worlds against me in fact
it aint no turning back bring it on
hate the price of fame cause it cost too much
can i live without yall niggas saying i floss too much
hate the way you make this hate flow all through us
steady looking for flaws through us lucky me
[chorus karen anderson jay-z]

you only know what you see 
you dont understand what it takes to be me
you only know what you see 
since i was 4 years old i been told everything that glitters aint gold
you dont understand what it takes to be me 
and now that ive arrived
i see those truths unfold before my eyes in this world so cold

nigga see you in the street pretend to be friendly
but i know any type of success breeds envy
i know in the back of your mind your conjuring ways to hen me
leave my friends in a circle pouring out henny
but gs is heaven bound so how im gon receive 
anything yall pour to the ground next time throw it up
and aint nothing changed so even in my afterlife i show it up
dont grieve for me my art remains
like a dart from the speaker to your heart
spiritually through the portal now my words as a mortal
plan to leave without a fight i plant a seed i give life
though i cant see past the girls greed to call her wife
next time your thinking heist better be precise
cause im fully prepared one of us is gon leave here
i have no regrets even though i wanna see grow
my godsons boogie sonny and rimo

[*cuts and scratches*]verse one
im from where the hammers rung news cameras never come
you and your man hung in every verse in your rhyme
where the grams is slung niggas vanish every summer
where the blue vans would come we throw the work in the can and run
where the plans was to get funds and skate off the set
to achieve this goal quicker sold all my weight wet
faced with immeasurable odds still i gave straight bets
so im felt im owed something and you nothing check
im from the other side with other guys dont walk to much
and girls in the projects wouldnt fuck us if we talked too much
so they ran up town and sought them dudes to trust
i dont know what the fuck they thought those niggas is foul just like us
im from where the beef is inevitable summertimes unforgettable
boosters in abundance buy a half-price sweater new
your word was everything so everything you said youd do
you did it couldnt talk about it if you aint lived it
im from where niggas pull your card and argue all day about
whos the best mcs biggie jay-z and nas
where the drugs czars evolve and thugs are at odds
at each others throats for the love of foreign cars
where cats catch cases hoping the judge r and rs
but most times find themselves locked up behind bars
im from where they ball and breed rhyme stars
im from marcy son just thought id remind yall

cough up a lung where im from marcy son/ aint nothing nice

verse 2
im from the place where the church is the flakiest
and niggas is praying to god so long that they atheist
where you cant put your vest away and say youll wear it tomorrow
cause the day after well be saying damn i was just with him yesterday
im a block away from hell not enough shots away from straight shells
an ounce away from a triple beam still using a hand-held weight scale
youre laughing you know the place well
where the liquor stores and the base dwell
and government fuck government niggas politic themselves
where we call the cops the a-team
cause they hop out of vans and spray things
and life expectancy so low we making out wills at eighteen
where how you get rid of guys who step out of line your rep solidifies
so tell me when i rap you think i give a fuck who criticize
if the shit is lies god strike me
and i got a question are you forgiving guys who live just like me
well never know
one day i pray to you and said if i ever blow id let em know 
mistakes and exactly what takes place in the ghetto
promise fulfilled but still i feel my job aint done
cough up a lung where im from marcy son aint nothing nice

verse 3
im from where they cross-over and clap boards
lost jehovah in place of rap lords listen
im up the block round the corner and down the street
from where the pimps prostitutes and the drug lords meet
we make a million off of beats cause our stories is deep
and fuck tomorrow as long as the night before was sweet
niggas get lost for weeks in the streets twisted off leek
and no matter the weather niggas know how to draw heat
whether youre four feet or manute-size it always starts out with
three dice and shoot the five
niggas thought they douce was live until i hit em with trips
and i reached down for their money pa forget about this
this time around its platinum like the shit on my wrist
and this glock on my waist yall cant do shit about this
niggas will show you love thats how they fool thugs
before you know it youre lying in a pool of bloodkelly price jay-z
talking throughout my life uh huh uh huh uh
no matter what ive doneright
youve been merciful and your love endureth yeah
through all things ye yeah for that
i am eternally grateful

verse 1
since my date of birth
bought you nothing but hurt
play those video games
stole change from ya purse
sat on the cold court bench
til i was arraigned in ya skirt
saw the pain in ya face
through you maintained a smirk
all you did was motivate me
dont let em hold you back
what i do i turned around
and i sold you crack
i was a bastard for that
still im drowning in shame
just remember one thing now
youre not to blame
you was newly seperated
tryin to escape ya world
and through my thirst
i didnt help you
i just made things worse
i hated me and everybody
that created crack
had me thinkin
the newest kicks and the latest gat
still havent apologized
so please play this back
while i try to come to terms
with such a heinous act
you know in more than one way
cocaine numbs the brain
all i did was think about
how the funds once came
then i ran across this memory 
and it stung the brain
how can you ever destroy the beauty
from which one came
thats a savage youre the reason
why me and these beats make a marriage
why i rhyme above average and
i aint shit
glad you got yourself together
no thanks to me
strong and beautiful the way thangs should be
you must love me

chorus k price you must love me repeats in background
say that you love me
all i know say that you must love me
ohh yeah

verse 2
we used to fight every night
but i never would suffer
just smile my big brothers
tryna make me tougher
as we grew fussing and fighting continued
as i plundered through ya stuff
and snuck ya clothes to school
got intense real intense
as we got older
never believed it would lead
to me poppin one in ya shoulda
with my range knew you had it
cause you took too long
as mickey andy and the girl that bought it looked on
huffin and puffin gun in my hand
told you step outside
hoping you said no but you hurt my pride
made our way down the steps
maybe you thought it was just a threat
or maybe ya life was just that crazy
and you was beggin for death
try to justify this in my young mind
but the adrenaline
and my ego hurt combined
drove me berzerk
saw the devil in your eyes
high off more than weed
confused i just closed
my young eyes and squeezed 
what a sound 
opened my eyes just in time
to see ya stumbling to the ground
damn what the fuck i done now
runnin around in a circle
thinking im assed out
hot gun burnin my waist
ran straight to jazs house
like a stranger damn i just shot my nigga
and ran off into the night as if it was not my nigga
left the scene how could i go out that way
still you asked to see me in the hospital the next day
you must love me

chorus you must love me repeats in background
what after all the wrong ive done
i know you must

verse 3 starts over last line of chorus
everything in my power and within my frame
to protect you from this life and
keep you away from the game
but you was one of the few people
that i can trust
and the fact of the matter i slang
these pies for us
you put the pressure on me dearly
rarely would you let it go
was a thousand and one times
i had to tell you no
when it was one of those days
when nobody was around
and i needed emergency trip
out of town
searched my mental rolodex
for all the numbers i know
as you stared in my face
asking me could you go
im agreed said sender
everythingll go smooth
just tell her what to do
and everythingll go through
strapped her body with them thangs
as you boarded the plane
couldnt explain these strange feelings 
that i caught and the pain
im thinkin why would i send you
when i knew it aint right
im thinkin what would
make you sacrifice ya life
you must love me

chorus you must love me repeats in background
after everything that ive done wrong
i know inside you must love me
i know that you love me
you showed me i know it
i know
say that you love me
say that you love me
i know you must love me
oh yes you do
inside i know it
youve always shown it
you love me yea yeah
oh yeah
i know that you love mesorry boys
but all the money in the world couldnt bring me back again
lay down lay down

never sit in the cell for a second then im gettin my bail
shoot it out with the bounty hunters fuck

drunk ginseng with japanese chicks &amp; pulled the root out
squeeze my whole clip to survive shootouts
been on both coasts fired all kinds of heat
probably be kinda glad to leave these mean streets
i got demands to meet and questions to fulfill
like is that mystery god real
and how was kennedy killed i aint mad
i mustve smoked a ton of reefer sipped coronas
with latifah broke the code of geneva
i know when i reach the other side ima see the
cat i had beef with who blood remains on my sneaker
then its on again if i could be born again
i live my life through my son
and tell him never have a friend
just family reincarnated ill show him the time

niggas hearts pump kool aid and yo blood run thicker
never shed tears cry liquor my nigga

im the aftermath of pleasure never die alone
born to live forever through lifes struggles
i cut corners &amp; took drastic measures
see you niggas life expire right in front of me
time could never mend what these cold streets
mentally done to me too often i close my eyes
and see my own coffin feelin haunted ready to leave
this world that im lost in my only chance
to see the seeds i lost through abortion
when im gone yall niggas better not mourn
keep flossin as long as my name
lives on whats most important
ill be down in hell scorchin preparin for life
afterlife still torchin &amp; blazin these mics
itd rain for 40 days &amp; 40 nights

verse 1 jay-z
growin up in the hood just my dog and me
we used to hustle in the hood for all to see
problems i called on him he called on me
we wasnt quite partners i hit him off my p
met him unlocked doors off my keys
yeah we spoke much more than cordially
man he broke bread with me my business spread swiftly
the feds came to get me we both fled quickly
wasnt quick enough to jump over the hedges with me
got caught and thats when our relationship strayed
used to call me from the joint til he ran out of change
and when he called collect and i heard his name
i quickly accepted but when i reached the phone
hes talkin reckless i can sense deceit in his tone
i said damn dawg what nine weeks and youre home
he said main man you think shits sweet cause youre home
i just sat spat no more speech in the phone
the crackers up there bleachin your dome youre reachin
i said the world dont stop ive got to keep keep on
from there i sensed the beef was on
i ran to the spot store to add some more features to my phone
to see if i had bugs and leeches on my phone
cant be too safe cause niggas is 2-faced
and they show the other side when they catch a new case
its on

chorus too $hort jay-z

and you bought a new home where you could keep the folks

we both came in this game blind as hell
i did a little better had more clientele

seventeen and im holdin on to around a mill
i could bail out and blow trial and come around on appeal
had niggas thinkin i was from uptown for real
i had so much hustle plus i was down to ill
like a brooklyn nigga straight out of brownsville
down and dirty down to fight the round 30
freezin on them corners still holdin my crack
lookin up and down the block the fuck is the dough at
came from flat broke to lettin the dough stack
you tell them feds i said im never goin back
im from marcy and marcy dont raise no rats
you know the consequences of your acts you cant be serious

chorus
it was cool when you had hella weed to smoke
and you bought a new home where you could keep the folks
i dont see how this side of you could be provoked

verse 3 jay-z
the lawyer i retained you said you leakin some things
all this after a week in the bang
im mad at myself cause i didnt spot the weak and lame
i woulda bet the house you wouldnt speak a thang
nigga this was the oath to the top of broke
even pricked our finger anything that got between us
we sposed to cock the ninas what happened to that
instead you copped out to a misdemeanor
fuck it the same thing make you laugh make you cry
thats right the same game that make you mad could make you die
its a dice game and sometimes you crap
who woulda thought youd get popped one time and rat
now you know thats bad when your sister is mad
and your son gotta grow up like this is my dad
the labelling of a snitch is a lifetime scar
youll always be in jail nigga just minus the bars

chorus
it was cool when you had hella weed to smoke
and you bought a new home where you could keep the folks
i dont see how this side of you could be provoked

drunk ginseng with japanese chicks &amp; pulled the root out
squeeze my whole clip to survive shootouts
been on both coasts fired all kinds of heat
probably be kinda glad to leave these mean streets
i got demands to meet and questions to fulfill
like is that mystery god real
and how was kennedy killed i aint mad
i mustve smoked a ton of reefer sipped coronas
with latifah broke the code of geneva
i know when i reach the other side ima see the
cat i had beef with who blood remains on my sneaker
then its on again if i could be born again
i live my life through my son
and tell him never have a friend
just family reincarnated ill show him the time

niggas hearts pump kool aid and yo blood run thicker
never shed tears cry liquor my nigga

im the aftermath of pleasure never die alone
born to live forever through lifes struggles
i cut corners &amp; took drastic measures
see you niggas life expire right in front of me
time could never mend what these cold streets
mentally done to me too often i close my eyes
and see my own coffin feelin haunted ready to leave
this world that im lost in my only chance
to see the seeds i lost through abortion
when im gone yall niggas better not mourn
keep flossin as long as my name
lives on whats most important
ill be down in hell scorchin preparin for life
afterlife still torchin &amp; blazin these mics
itd rain for 40 days &amp; 40 nights

growin up in the hood just my dog and me
we used to hustle in the hood for all to see
problems i called on him he called on me
we wasnt quite partners i hit him off my p
met him unlocked doors off my keys
yeah we spoke much more than cordially
man he broke bread with me my business spread swiftly
the feds came to get me we both fled quickly
wasnt quick enough to jump over the hedges with me
got caught and thats when our relationship strayed
used to call me from the joint til he ran out of change
and when he called collect and i heard his name
i quickly accepted but when i reached the phone
hes talkin reckless i can sense deceit in his tone
i said damn dawg what nine weeks and youre home
he said main man you think shits sweet cause youre home
i just sat spat no more speech in the phone
the crackers up there bleachin your dome youre reachin
i said the world dont stop ive got to keep keep on
from there i sensed the beef was on
i ran to the spot store to add some more features to my phone
to see if i had bugs and leeches on my phone
cant be too safe cause niggas is 2-faced
and they show the other side when they catch a new case
its on

chorus too $hort jay-z

we both came in this game blind as hell

seventeen and im holdin on to around a mill
i could bail out and blow trial and come around on appeal
had niggas thinkin i was from uptown for real
i had so much hustle plus i was down to ill
like a brooklyn nigga straight out of brownsville
down and dirty down to fight the round 30
freezin on them corners still holdin my crack
lookin up and down the block the fuck is the dough at
came from flat broke to lettin the dough stack
you tell them feds i said im never goin back
im from marcy and marcy dont raise no rats
you know the consequences of your acts you cant be serious

chorus

the lawyer i retained you said you leakin some things
all this after a week in the bang
im mad at myself cause i didnt spot the weak and lame
i woulda bet the house you wouldnt speak a thang
nigga this was the oath to the top of broke
even pricked our finger anything that got between us
we sposed to cock the ninas what happened to that
instead you copped out to a misdemeanor
fuck it the same thing make you laugh make you cry
thats right the same game that make you mad could make you die
its a dice game and sometimes you crap
who woulda thought youd get popped one time and rat
now you know thats bad when your sister is mad
and your son gotta grow up like this is my dad
the labelling of a snitch is a lifetime scar
youll always be in jail nigga just minus the bars

chorus

i came in the door for dolo blazed the crews
and the streets say jigga cant go back home
you know when i heard that  when i was back home
im comfortable dog brooklyn to rome
on any martin luther dont part with your future
dont ever question if i got the heart to shoot ya
the answer is simply too dark for the user
and as a snot-nose they said that he got flows
but will he be able to drop those before the cops close in
fore the shots froze him and hes dead and gone

at any given moment shawn could lose it be on the news
iron cuffs - arms through it; or stuffed with embalmin fluid
shit im goin through it - mom dukes too
tears streamin down her pretty face she got her palms to it
my life is gettin too wild
i need to bring some sort kinda calm to it
bout to lose it; voices screamin dont do it
its like 93 94 bout the year
that big and mag dropped; and illmatic rocked
outta every rag drop and the west had it locked
everybody doin em im still scratchin on the block
like damn; ima be a failure
surrounded by thugs drugs and drug - paraphenalia
cops courts and their thoughts is to derail us
three time felons in shorts with jealous thoughts
tryin figure where your mail is guesstimate the weight you sellin
so they can send shots straight to your melon; wait
it gets worse baby momma water burst
baby came out stillborn still i gotta move on
though my heart still torn life gone from her womb
dont worry if it was meant to be itll be -- soon

[chorus jay-z]

and when i heard that i just broke into tears
and see in the second hand; you dont really know how this is
but when it hits that close to home you feel the pain at the crib
so i called mine and saddened my wife with the bad news

prayin for young souls to laugh atlife through the stars
lovin your kids just like you was ours
and im hurtin for you dog; but aint nobody pain is like yours
i just know that heavenll open these doors
and aint no bright side to losin lifel; but you can view it like this
gods got open hands homey he in the midst of good company
who loves all and hates not one
and one day you gon be wit your son
i couldve rapped about my hard times on this song
but heaven knows i woulda been wrong

you find a dude in town you send him a short message

cause most niggaz dont know a brick from a bike
they keep buyin hard white
and if you free tomorrow night we can meet and discuss price
fyi i never been robbed in my life
or -- you find a chick shit you hole up in her crib and
let her introduce you round town like her man
shake hands make friends like its all innocent
then -- before they look up you sellin the town cook-up
or -- gorilla pimp come up on that killer shit
take a nigga brick smack him then you sell it back to them

ginger bread man never think of gettin caught
look at your hand man damn you fought
nigga you left my mom
left us with no good-byes
you left us out to dry
you left us with no letters notes nothing no replies
no digits numbers was unlisted
you left us with some of my loneliest night
nigga some of my hungriest nights

with one goal and one plan
get mommy out of some jam she was always in one
always short with the income
always late with the rent

i would stay in the hallway waitin
always playin the bench waitin
and that day came and went
fuck you very much you showed me the worst kind of pain
but im stronger and trust me i will never hurt again
will never ask mommy why daddy dont love me

[chorus]

a face of stone was shocked on the other end of the phone
word back home is that you had a special friend
so what was oh so special then

thats your fault how many times you forgiven me
how was i to know that you was plain sick of me
i know the way a nigga livin was whack
but you dont get a nigga back like that

motherfuckers -
say that im foolish i only talk about jewels bling bling
do you fools listen to music or do you just skim through it
see im influenced by the ghetto you ruined
that same dude you gave nothin i made somethin doin
what i do through and through and
i give you the news - with a twist its just his ghetto point-of-view
the renegade; you been afraid
i penetrate pop culture bring em a lot closer to the block where they
pop toasters and they live with they moms
got dropped roasters from botched robberies niggaz crotched over
mommys knocked up cause she wasnt watched over
knocked down by some clown when child support knocked
no hes not around - now how that sound to ya jot it down
i bring it through the ghetto without ridin round
hidin down duckin strays from frustrated youths stuck in they ways
just read a magazine that fucked up my day
how you rate music that thugs with nothin relate to it
i help them see they way through it - not you
cant step in my pants cant walk in my shoes
bet everything you worth; you lose your tie and your shirt

[eminem]
since im in a position to talk to these kids and they listen
i aint no politician but ill kick it with em a minute
cause see they call me a menace; and if the shoe fits ill wear it
but if it dont then yallll swallow the truth grin and bear it
now whos these king of these rude ludicrous lucrative lyrics
who could inherit the title put the youth in hysterics
usin his music to steer it sharin his views and his merits
but theres a huge interference - theyre sayin you shouldnt hear it
maybe its hatred i spew maybe its food for the spirit
maybe its beautiful music i made for you to just cherish
but im debated disputed hated and viewed in america
as a motherfuckin drug addict - like you didnt experiment
now now thats when you start to stare at whos in the mirror
and see yourself as a kid again and you get embarrased
and i got nothin to do but make you look stupid as parents
you fuckin do-gooders - too bad you couldnt do good at marriage
ha ha and do you have any clue what i had to do to get here i dont
think you do so stay tuned and keep your ears glued to the stereo
cause here we go - hes {*jigga joint jigga-chk-jigga*}
and im the sinister mr kiss-my-ass its just the

[chorus eminem + jay-z]
[em] renegade  never been afraid to say
whats on my mind at any given time of day
cause im a renegade  never been afraid to talk
about anything anything anything anything renegade
[jay] never been afraid to say
whats on my mind at any given time of day
cause im a {renegade} never been afraid to holler
about anything {anything} anything {anything}

[jay-z]
i had to hustle my back to the wall ashy knuckles
pockets filled with a lot of lint not a cent
gotta vent lot of innocent of lives lost on the project bench
whatchu hollerin gotta pay rent bring dollars in
by the bodega iron under my coat feelin braver
doo-rag wrappin my waves up pockets full of hope
do not step to me - im awkward i box leftier often
my pops left me an orphan my momma wasnt home
could not stress to me i wasnt grown; specially on nights
i brought somethin home to quiet the stomach rumblings
my demeanor - thirty years my senior
my childhood didnt mean much only raisin green up
raisin my fingers to critics; raisin my head to the sky
big i did it - multi before i die nigga
no lie just know i chose my own fate
i drove by the fork in the road and went straight

[eminem]
see im a poet to some a regular modern day shakespeare
jesus christ the king of these latter day saints here
to shatter the picture in which of that as they paint me
as a monger of hate and satan a scatter-brained atheist
but that aint the case see its a matter of taste
we as a people decide if shadys as bad as they say he is
or is he the latter - a gateway to escape
media scapegoat who they can be mad at today
see its easy as cake simple as whistlin dixie
while im wavin the pistol at sixty christians against me
go to war with the mormons take a bath with the catholics
in holy water - no wonder they try to hold me under longer
im a motherfuckin spiteful delightful eyeful
the new ice cube - motherfuckers hate to like you
what did i do huh im just a kid from the gutter
makin this butter off these bloodsuckers cause im a muhfuckin

[chorus] - repeat 2xyeah yeah

dont repeat what i say i said he said nothin
he agreed with his head he just nodded like this
what i believe to be a yes i re-peated what was said
it came to me like a whisper last evening i said
whats the deal playboy was the greeting he said
first thing i wanted to know was the reason he was dead
more money more problems better believe it he said
careful what you wish for you might receive it he said
i see i said jealousy i said

saltnpepa and heavy d up in the limousine
hangin pictures on my wall

i let my tape rock til my tape popped
smokin weed and bamboo sippin on private stock
way back when i had the red and black lumberjack
with the hat to match
remember rappin duke duh-ha duh-ha
you never thought that hip-hop would take it this far
now im in the limelight cause i rhyme tight
time to get paid blow up like the {**world trade**}
born sinner the opposite of a winner
remember when i used to eat sardines for dinner
peace to ron g brucey b kid capri
funkmaster flex lovebug starsky

call the crib same number same hood its all good
uhh and if you dont know now you know nigga

only two restin in heaven can be mentioned in the same breath as him
seven straight summers critics might not admit it
but nobody in rap did it quite like i did it

got mad at it and dont want it no more
and that goes for everything from flippin that raw
flippin whores flippin vocal chords dont get it twisted

[verse one jay-z]
things just aint the same for gangsters
but im a little too famous to shoot these pranksters
all of these rap singers claimin they bangers
doin all sorts of twisted shit with they fingers
disrespectin the game no home trainin or manners
i was doin this shit when you was shittin pampers
i was movin them grams fore you knew what a hand-to-hand was
duckin the vans radars the scanners
fore you knew what hard white to tame was
i was hittin the turnpike aight with the bammers
i was nice with my hands cause i fight with them hammers
i was prickin my finger fore you knew what a fam was
i had it laid out fore you knew what a plan was
three hundred mill later now you understand us
yall aint see us comin through vegas
you ever seen so much cham bust in one night
grand fucked up one fight
i was on the peter pan bus
you was peter pan up in your room yall fuckin with whom
allow me to retort
you cowards is just now learnin the shit that we taught
you niggaz aint know about a robb report
bout a high speed porsche 
ie you niggaz aint know how to floss 
til i came through the door
like eric b for pres respect me in this bitch
you cant disrespect us cause you got a little check cut
you was suckin so long fuckin ya little neck up
now you too big for your britches you got a few little bitches
you think you hugh hefner you just ridiculous
i blew breath on you midgets i gave light to the game
its only right i got the right to be king
niggaz that got life really like what i sing
cause they know is he really like niggaz feel my pain
know the shit i dont write 
be the illest shit thats ever been recited
in the game word to the hyphen in my name
j a y - hoffa
the past present nigga the future proper
the holy trinity of hip-hop is us
we give dre his props but thats where it stops
its the roc

[chorus truth hurts]
i know you got your eyes on me
i feel you watchin me
but it aint hard to see that you cant see me
you try but what you think you saw
aint what you thought you saw
you bed-da off not lookin at all
everywhere that i go aint the same as befo
people i used to know just dont know me no mo
but everywhere that i go i got people i know
who got people they know so i suggest you lay low

[verse two dr dre]
im still on top of the game
still droppin flames still cock and aim
still at the top had the roc for the fame
over setbacks theres been a lot since i came
you seen it all how i got how i gained
the momentum when it dropped how i got through the pain
when i roll and shock they watched me reclaim
the streets they made a special spot for my name
dre haters wanna stop to my reign
but the music lives in me every drop in my veins
the pride and the pain
all the way back from the rise of my name
see the world clear through the eyes of the mane
see the world chear for the rhymes that i gave
when the beat bangs itll drive them insane
the eyes that i played
the best to emerge in the game is the watcher

[chorus truth hurts]
i know you got your eyes on me
i feel you watchin me
but it aint hard to see that you cant see me
you try but what you think you saw
aint what you thought you saw
you bed-da off not lookin at all
everywhere that i go aint the same as befo
people i used to know just dont know me no mo
but everywhere that i go i got people i know
who got people they know so i suggest you lay low

[verse three rakim]
im rated r my brain contains graphics thangs
it turn traumatic teens into addicts and fiends
its like watchin a movie through a panoramic screen
which means i can see the whole planet in the scene
cash is the topic the object a fatter pocket
some take the crack and chop it but those that havent got it
take away the added profit its catastrophic
i take the gat and cock it and ill sit back and watch it
these new york streets is ugly i keep it gully
the world is mine and cant nobody keep it from me
yo my neighborhood is never sunny
in the place where the number one cause of death is money

verse 1 jay-z
look for me young b
cruisin down the westside high way
doing what we like to do our way
eyes behind shades this necklace the reason
all of my dates been blind dates
but today i got my thoroughest girl wit me
im mashin the gas shes grabbin the wheel its true to the heart
she rides with me - the new bobby and whitney
only time we dont speak is during sex and the city
she gets carrie fever but soon as the show is over
shes right back to being my soldier
cuz mamis a rider and im a roller
put us together how they gon stop both us
what ever she lacks im right over her shoulder
when im off track mami is keepin me focused
so lets lock this down like its supposed to be
the 03 bonnie and clyde hov and b

chorus

verse 2 jay-z
the problem is you dudes treat the one that you lovin
with the same respect that you treat the one that you humpin

with no be-atch; oh no you wont see that
and no i aint perfect - nobody walkin this earths surface is
but girlfriend work with the kid
i keep you workin at hermes burking bag
manolo blahnik timbs aviator lens
600 drops mercedes benz
the only time you wear burberry to swim
and i dont have to worry only worry is him
she do anything necessary for him
and i do anything necessary for her
so dont let the necessary occur yep

chorus
jay all i need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend

keep a glock that will shock and bring the rest
tucked underneath my michelin s
i travellin handlin with a forty-five cannon
its tucked in my marc buchanan
extra clips and shells in the lambskin
two deep by pelle pelle
westside how they felly fell
more gs on me than a late 80s gucci leather
worn by the great rakim himself
stitch my dapper dan oh man with the gun in hand
i leave your blood squirting
no offense ill put your face on the chest
of a sweatshirt drawn by shirt kings
i been fucking a hustle married to a racket
since the first air jordans and starter jackets
i slept with a package under mattress
i carry guns heavy speakeasy slight with the fight words
ill put somethin hot through your motherfuckin iceberg
got a project chica named rica
she keep a purse full of dro reefer
small pinkies like that
talk til the paper fat
i rock somethin roll chief +sacks+ like daddy fat

[chorus]

[verse four big boi]
pop tires in reverse youll be needin a nurse
leave you layin on your back in a cadillac hearse

whats worse you can hit the mall and ball til you fall
have to make a collect call but your cell cut off
trot to the mailbox thinkin a check but the mails run short
no more md dd ld
that means movie date dinner date lunch date help me please
my sheets is gone
long bread to the short bread word is bond
meticulously pimpously serve the song
act a damn donkey
like the pilgrims when they popped a tag on the indians home
drop top rag-o with the weed gone
chillin bags in the trunk full of feo schwartz for the chilluns
spent a few shillings
sip a few chickens lick a few kittens just kiddin
a fresh bowl of milk is in the fridge and
can you pop the tags on the honeycombs
or are you actin mad cause the money done
slowed down just a little bit
dipped poked out did some shull-bit
actin like a pitfall bull-pit
dead game is the pul-pit
leave a motherpumper with his john doe toe tag clipped
imperial classic a lyrical thrashin
a miracle happenin
jay-z killer mike and big boi rappin and rhymin and smabbin
pop that tag on some of this game
holla-tic swallow and keep the change

the real hood like three pair of pants
my friends ill say it clear pair of sneakers
my moms is bustin her ass state my case
nigga im goin to japan tomorrow which im certain
you understand what im sayin can you believe that
i lived a life thats full they have people waitin
at the airport like five days like im a beatle or somethin
thats really somethin and i travelled each and every highway
seen the best of the best the worst of the worst and more
much more than this still here i did it myyyyyy wayyyyyyy
lets try this one

[jay-z + singer]
uhh yeah gangsta nigga
put my hustle down tore the game up nigga
took your high score down put my name up nigga
tore the doors down til the hall of fame is jigga
i did it my way and more much more than this
thats right its a beautiful thing man
i did it myyyyyy wayyyyyyy i did it my way -- hovi baby

mommas youngest and strongest survived summers like saunas
mastered a corner like deion in his uniform
pop hurtin assertive flirted with death
damn near murdered before my first album hit the shelf
grandmas favorite she could not understand
how theres people in the world who wouldnt want me as a neighbor
has to explain to her you think these folks want me in the penthouse
as a reminder that i make top paper
black entrepeneur nobody did us no favors
nobody gave us shit we made us
the rap pack im sinatra dames sam davis
bigs the smart one on the low like dean martin
we came in this game not beggin niggaz pardon
demandin yall respect hand over a check
and while yall at it hand over the jet
we the reason they aint hand over def jam so quick
they new every year i was droppin new product
i was raisin the stock up while buildin the roc up
but thats alright cause they knew they had to see us
when it was time for us to re-up make us multi-million-ires
je-je-jeah

and more much more than this; i did it myyyyyy wayyyyyyy

jeah in my lifetime
i caught smaller cases but i had capital
hypocritic system let me right back at you
you better hope a rich rapper never attacks you
not even that scratches you specially if you black dude
they dont give a shit unless the accused just happen to rap
and they can look good by paintin him as bad news
cause in my past i seen dudes get half of they views
exposed to the curb and nobody said a word
so imagine how disturbed i was
when i seen how big they made my fight scene at the club
let me explain exactly how this shit was
this nigga un yo i scratched him he went home without an aspirin
but its cool cause hes back friends and half-inning is over
its in the past and im glad now im back to bein hova
me back with the chaffeur laid back
helicopter seat feat inclined shit feelin like a sofa
helicopter meet me teta vero take me over
somewhere peaceful for the weekend now its back to speakin of vultures
so the next time that page six approaches us
heres a quote from jay nigga i did it my - way

and more much more than this; i did it myyyyyy wayyyyyyycan you hear me now  good  blueprint 2 baby

who knew that would be his last shot who drew up that play
they giveth and they taketh life is cruel that way
but even a broken clock is right at least two times a day
you could have turned guns into roses like two times today
now heres something you gotta say two times to jay
i got my shades on waiting for the sun to shine my way
got my boom box suntan lotion waiting for action
they say when you play with skills good luck could happen
lets go

cmon its the roc repeat 4x
thats right

[jay-z]
things got too hot so i jumped off in this rap shit
you got it kris-krossed aint no turning me backwards
too many district attorneys concerned with the actions
of one individual hes criminally attached
i turned in all my rap chips im earning my bachelors
while dating all the models and actresses
im learning all the potholes in every single barrio
trying not to mess up my axis kid
on the road to the riches through trafficking
through rappining and whatevers happening
roc-a-wear im the young black ralph lauren
every time i get out they put me right back in
the michael corleone of the microphone
the michelangelo of flow i paint pictures with poems
i gather no moss like a rolling stone
case the grim reaper visits my home nigga im gone cmon

cmon its the roc 3x
cmon thats right cmon

[lenny kravitz repeat 2x]
life is all about guns and roses
bittersweet like friends and foes
some get left behind and some get chosen
just like life guns and roses

[jay-z]
tote more guns then roses foes is 
visibly shook of the invisible bully lets go
flowers need water to grow it gotta rain
and in order to experience joy you need pain
every time a baby is born somebodys slain
you know the saying somebodys lose is anothers gain
the sun comes out when the water goes down the drain
a rainbow then the clouds come out we do it again
everything evens up you just wait
even a garbage can gets a steak
you aint even a garbage can you have faith
but when it turns your way before it turns away
gotta turn that into something you gotta learn from jay
you will get return in your investment if attention you pay lets go

cmon its the roc 3x
cmon thats right cmon

[lenny kravitz repeat 2x]
life is all about guns and roses
bittersweet like friends and foes
some get left behind and some get chosen

lets take a trip down
i got  yall

lets take a trip down memory lane at the cemetery 
rain gray skies seems at the end of every young black live
its this line damn him already 
such a goodkid got us poring hennessy already
liquor to the curb for the niggas up above
when it cracks through to pavement thats my way of sending love 
so give big a hug tell aaliyah i said high
till the next time i see her on the other side 
he was just some thug that caught some slugs 
and we loved him cause in him we saw some of us 
he walked like us talked like us
his back against the wall nigga fought like us
damn poor isyss that his momma name momma aint strong enough to raise no boy
whats his father name shorty never knew him though he had his blood in em
hot temper momma sad he act just like her husband
daddy never fucked with em so the streets raised em 
isyss blaming herself she wish she could have saved him
damn near impossible only men can raise men
he was his own man not even him could save him 
he put his faith in the 38 in his waist
but when ya live by the gun you die by the same fate
end up dead before 38 and a 
thats the life of whats raised by a winter its a cold world
old girl turned to coke tried to smoke her pain away
isyss life just ended on that rainy day
when she got the news her boy body could be viewed down at the city mourge 
open the drawer saw em nude
her addiction grew
prescription drugs dipped in brew
angel dust dipped in whoo
she slipped into her own fantasy world 
had her self pregnant by different dude
but reality bites and this is her life 
he wasnt really her husband though he called her wife 
it was just this night when the moon was full  and the stars was just right
and the dress was real tight 
and it sounded like lisa lisa i wonder if i take you home
will you still love me after this night
mike was the hard head from around the way that she wanted all her life
shit she wanted all the hype
used to hold on tight when they wheelied on the bike
he was a willie all her life
he wasnt really the one to like 
it was a dude named shi
who would really treat her right
he wanted to run to the country to escape the city life
but isyss liked this broad way life
she loved the gucci sneakers the red green and white
hanging out the window when she first seen em fight 
so turned on that she had to shower twice
how ironic it would be some fight 
that would turn it to a homicide that would alter their life
see mike at 32 was still on the seen 
he had a son 15 that he never saw twice
sure he saw him as an infant but he disowned him 
like if that was my son he would look much different
see im light skinned and that baby theres dark
so its mommas baby poppas maybe  
mike was still crazy out there running the streets
had his old reliable 38 gun in his reach
he spent 14 years him and isyss aint speak 
he runnin around like life is a peach 
till one day he approached this thug 
that had a mean mug 
and he looked so familiar that he called um young cuz 
told em get off the strip but the boy aint budge
instead he pulled out a newer 38 snug
he clearly had to drop but the boy just paused
it was something in this mans face he knew he seen before 
its like looking in the mirror seeing his self more mature
he took it as a sign from the almighty lord
you know what they say about he who hesitates at war
whats that he who hesitates is lost
he cant explain what he saw before his picture went blank
the old man didnt think he just followed his instinct 
six shots into his kin out of the gun 
niggas be a father ya killing ya son
six shots into his kin out of the gun 
niggas be a father ya killing ya son
meet the parents

and this is with whom you want to place your faith
i put dollars on mine ask columbine
when the twin towers dropped i was the first in line
donating proceeds off every ticket sold
when i was out on the road thats how you judge hov no
aint i supposed to be absorbed myself
every time theres a tragedy im the first one to help
they call me this misogynist but they dont call me the dude
to take his dollars to give gifts at the projects
these dudes is all politics depositing checks
they put in they pocket all you get in return is a lot of lip
and yall buy the shit caught up in the hype
cause the nigga wear a coofie it dont mean that he bright
cause you dont understand him it dont mean that he nice
it just means you dont understand all the bullshit that he write
is it oochie wally wally or is it one mic
is it black girl lost or shorty owe you for ice
ive been real all my life they confuse it with conceit
since i will not lose they try to help him cheat
but i will not lose for even in defeat
theres a valuable lesson learned so it evens it up for me
when the grass is cut the snakes will show
i gotta thank the little homie nas for that though
saving me the hassle of speaking to half of these assholes
and ima let karma catch up to jaz-o whoa
im back before you had a chance to miss me
my mama cant save you this time niggas is history
who you know flow vicious as me
yet so religiously thats why they call me hov
i get the spoils cause the victor is me me nigga
youre an actor youre not who youre depicted to be
the street dreamin all yall niggas living through me
i gave you life when niggas was forgetting you emcee
im a legend you should take a picture with me
you should be happy to be in my presence i should charge you a fee
im big dog glenn rob listen god you a flea
and the little homey jungle is a garden to me
whats the problem b  you not as hard as me
nigga hard as we nigga r o c nigga
thats why they follow me they feel my pain and my agony nigga

theres part of him growing up 
his shirts soaks up your tears as he holds ya 
you heart beatin so fast speeding his pulse up 
yeah i know it sucks life aint a rose bud 
a couple of speed bumps 
you gotta take your lumps 
off to bootcamp the worlds facing terror 
bin laden been happenin in manhatten 
crack was anthrax back then back when 
police was alqaeda to black me 
while i was out there hustling sinning with no religion 
he was off the wall killing for a living 

[chorus] 

[verse 2] 
days turn to nights nights turn to years 
years turn to how the fuck we make it in here 
my barracks average couple fights a day 
get you locked in a hole wont see the light of day 
and i feel like im just writing my life away 
i never thought shit could end up quite this way 
theres a war goingon outside no man is safe from 
im here for the good fight only the fakes run 
im here for the purple heart if i cant take one 
for my team or my siblings whats my reason for living 
i love my niggas more than anything else

[verse 3]

[chorus]and the other night when i was researching what we were going to be discussing today i came across a passage that i think it really exemplifies what the young brother next to me was talking about and that all things must come to an end it is an inevitable part of the cycle of existence all things must conclude take the analogy of a tree that grows in brooklyn among the steel and concrete with all of its glorious branches and leaves one day he too will pass on his legacy through the seeds that drop to the ground and as the wind carry these seeds throughout the land a new life will begin for each one of them as they stand for a monument to the one that came before[intro gloria carter]
shawn carter was born december 4th
weighing in at ten pounds eight ounces
he was the last of my four children
the only one who didnt give me any pain when i gave birth to him
and thats how i knew that he was a special child

hi baby whats wrong  you look like youve lost your best friend
tell me is it something that ive done again
you look like youve lost your best friend
tell me

[verse one jay-z]
they say they never really miss you til you dead or you gone
so on that note im leavin after this song
see you aint gotta feel no way about jay so long
at least let me tell you why im this way hold on
i was conceived by gloria carter and adnus reeves
who made love under the sycamore tree
which makes me a more sicker mc and my momma would claim
at ten pounds when i was born i didnt give her no pain
although through the years i gave her her fair share
i gave her her first real scare i made up for birth when i got here
she knows my purpose was on purpose i aint perfect i care
but i feel worthless cause my shirts wasnt matchin my gear
now im just scratchin the surface cause whats buried under there
was a kid torn apart once his pop disappeared
i went to school got good grades could behave when i wanted
but i had demons deep inside that would raise when confronted
hold on

[interlude gloria carter]
shawn was a very shy child growing up
he was into sports and a funny story is
at four he taught himself how to ride a bike
a two-wheel at that isnt that special
but i noticed a change in him when me and my husband broke up

[verse two jay-z]
now all the teachers couldnt reach me and my momma couldnt beat me
hard enough to match the pain of my pop not seein me so
with disdain in my membrane
got on my pimp game fuck the world my defense came
then the haven introduced me to the game
spanish jose introduced me to caine; im a hustler now
my gear is in and im in the in-crowd
and all the wavy light-skinned girls is lovin me now
my self-esteem went through the roof man i got my swag
got a volvo from this girl when her man got bagged
plus i hit my momma with cash from a show that i had
supposedly - knowin nobody paid jaz wack ass
im gettin ahead of myself by the way i could rap
that came second to me movin this crack
give me a second i swear i would say about my rap career
til ninety-six came niggaz im here - goodbye

[interlude gloria carter]
shawn used to be in the kitchen beating on the table and rapping 
and umm into the wee hours of the morning
and then i brought him a boombox
and his sisters and brothers said that he would drive them nuts 
but that was my way to keep him close to me and out of trouble

[verse three jay-z]
goodbye to the game all the spoils the adrenaline rush
your blood boils you in a spot knowin cops could rush
at you in the drop you so easy to touch
no two days are alike except the 1st and 15th pretty much
and trust is a word you seldom hear from us
hustlers we dont sleep we rest one eye up
and a drought could define a man when the well dries up
you learn the worth of water
without work you thirst til you die - yup
and niggaz get tied up for product
and little brothers ring fingers get cut up
to show mothers they really got em
and this is the stress i lived with
til i decided to try this rap shit for a livin
i pray im forgiven - for every bad decision i made
every sister i played - cause im still paranoid to this day
and its nobody fault i made the decisions ive made
this is the life i chose or rather the life that chose me

[outro fades out]
if you cant respect that your whole perspective is whack
maybe youll love me when i fade to black
if you cant respect that your whole perspective is whack
maybe youll love me when i fade to black
now if you cant respect that your whole perspective is whack
maybe youll love me when i fade to black
if you cant respect that your whole perspective is whack
maybe youll love me when i fade to blackare you not entertained

[verse 1]
pop died didnt cry didnt know him that well
between him doin heroin and me doin crack sales
put that in an eggshell standing at the tabernacle rather the church
pretending to be hurt wouldnt work 
so a smirk was all on my face
like damn that mans face is just like my face
so pop i forgive you for all the shit that i lived through
i wasnt all your fault homie you got caught
into the same game i fought
that uncle ray lost
my big brothers and so many others i saw
im just glad we got to see each other
talk and re meet each other 
save a place in heaven for the next time we meet forever

[chorus]

[verse 2]
the music business hate me cause the industry aint make me
hustlers and boosters embrace me and the music i be makin
i dumbed down for my audience and double my dollars
they criticize me for it yet they all yell holla
if skillz sold truth be told 
i probably be - lyrically talib kweli
truthfully i wanna rhyme like common sense
but i did 5 mil i aint been rhymin like common sense
when your sense got that much in common and you been hustlin since
your inception fuck perception go with what make sense
since i know what im up against we as rappers must decide what is most impor-tant
and i cant help the poor if im one of them 
so i got rich and gave back to me thats a win win
so next time you see the homie and his rims spin
just know my mind is workin just like them
the rims that is

[chorus]

[verse 3]
my homie sigels on a tier where no tears should fall

[chorus]if you havin girl problems i feel bad for you son

im from the hood stupid; what type of facts are those

if you grew up with holes in your zapatos
youd celebrate the minute you was havin dough
im like fuck critics; you can kiss my whole asshole
if you dont like my lyrics you can press fast forward
got beef with radio if i dont play they show
they dont play my hits; well i dont give a shit so

rap mags try and use my black ass
so advertisers can give em more cash for ads fuckers
i dont know what you take me as
or understand the intelligence that jay-z has
im from rags to riches niggas; i aint dumb

well my glove compartment is locked so is the trunk in the back
and i know my rights so you gon need a warrant for that ha-ha

now once upon a time not too long ago
a nigga like myself had to strongarm a hoe
this is not a hoe in the sense of havin a pussy
but a pussy havin no goddamn sense; try and push me
i try to ignore him talk to the lord
pray for him but some fools just love to perform
you know the type loud as a motorbike
but wouldnt bust a grape in a fruit fight
and only thing thats gon happen is ima get to clappin and
he and his boys gon be yappin to the captain
and there i go trapped in the kit-kat again
back through the system with the riff-raff again
fiends on the floor scratchin again
paparazzis with they cameras snappin them
da try to give a nigga shaft again
half a mill for bail cause im african
all because this fool was harassin them
tryin to play the boy like hes saccharine
but aint nuttin sweet bout how i hold my gun

[verse 1 jay-z]

the allure of breakin the law
its always too much for me to ever ignore
i gotta thing for them big body benzes it dulls my senses
im in love with a v-dub engine
mann im high off life- fuck it im wasted
bathing ape kicks audemar piguet wrists
my women friend get tennis bracelets
trips ta venice get their winters replaced with
the sun it aint even fun no more im jaded
man its just da game i just play it to play it
put my feet in the footprints left to me
without sayin a word the ghettos got a mental telepathy
man my brother hustled so naturally up next is me
but what perplexes me
shit i know how this movie ends still i play
the starrin role in hovitos way

[chorus]
its just life i solemnly swear
to change my approach stop shavin coke
stay away from hoes put down the toast
cause i be doin the most oh no
but every time i felt that was that it called me right back
it called me right back man it called me right back - oh no

[verse two]
im like a russian mobster drinkin distilled vodka
til im under the field with hoffa its real
peel the top up like a toupee
mix the water with the soda
turn the pot up make a souflee
all of yall can get it like group-page on your 2-way
im livin proof that crime do pay
say hooray to the bad guy and all the broads
puttin cars in they name for the stars of the game
puttin caine in they bras and their tomorrows on the train
all in the name of love
just to see that love locked in chains and the family came
over the house to take back everything that they claimed
or even the worst pain is the dis-tress
learnin youre the mis-tress only after that love gets slain
and the anger and the sorrow mixed up leads to mis-trust
now it gets tough to ever love a-gain
but the allure of the game keeps callin your name
to all the lauras of the world i feel your pain
to all the christies in every cities and tiffany lanes
we all hustlers in love with the same thang

[chorus]

[verse three]
i never felt more alive than ridin shotgun
in clines green 5 until the cops pulled guns
and i tried to smoke weed to give me the fix i need
what the game did to my pulse with no results
and you can treat your nose and still wont come close
the game is a lightbulb with eleventy-million volts
and im just a moth addicted to the floss
and doors lift from the floor and the tops come off
by any means necessary whatever the cost
even if it means lives is lost
and i cant explain why i just love to get high
drink life smoke the blueberry sky blink twice
im in the blueberry 5 you blink three times
i may not even be alive
i mean james dean couldnt escape the allure
dyin young leavin a good lookin corpse 
course

[chorus]

once again its the life
i said its the life
once again its the life - oh no
i dont why i why i get so high on
get so get so high on uh-huh
get so high - high off the life
hahahahahahaha - woo[intro notorious big interview]
well im basically tryin to stay above water yknow
just stay busy stay workin
puff told me like the key to this joint
the key to staying on top of things
is treat everything like its your first project knahmsayin
like its your first day like back when you was an intern
like thats how you try to treat things like just stay hungry

[verse one jay-z]
uhh uhh yes yes
yall wanna know why he dont stop
yall wanna know why he dont flop
let me tell you pe-peeople why
came from the bottom of the block i
when i was born it was sworn i was never gon be shit
had to pull the opposite out this bitch
had to get my ri-ide on
eyes on the prize shawn knew i had to
had to had to get these chips
had to make moves like olajuwon
started out sellin dimes and nicks
graduated to a brick
no exaggeration my infatuation with the strip
legendary like a schoolboy
crushin merely nearly every every chick
heavy shit - thats how schoolboy got whipped
and got left on some just +me myself and i+
on some trugoy shit
had your boys threw place up to a place of no return
had to play with fire and get burned
only way the boy ever gon learn
had to lay way in the cut til i finally got my turn
now im on top in the spot that i earned

[chorus]
its my life - its my pain and my struggle
the song that i sing to you its my ev-ery-thing
treat my first like my last and my last like my first
and my thirst is the same as - when i came
its my joy and my tears and the laughter it brings to me
its my ev-ery-thing

[verse two jay-z]
like i never rode in a limo
like i just dropped flows to a demo
like its ninety-two again and
and i got os in the rental
back in the stu again no prob livin was a whole lot simpler
when you think back you thought that
you would never make it this far then you
take advantage of the luck you handed
or the talent you been given
aint no half steppin aint no no slippin
aint no different from a block thats hidden
gotta get it while the gettings good
gotta strike while the irons hot fore you stop
then you gotta bid it good riddance
goodbye this is my second major breakup
my first was with a pager
with a hooptie a cookpot and the game
this ones with the stool with the stage with the fortune
maybe not the fortune but certainly the fame

[chorus]
its my life - my pain and my struggle
the song that i sing to you its my ev-ery-thing
treat my first like my last and my last like my first
and my thirst is the same as - when i came
its my joy and my tears and my laughter it brings to me
its my ev-ery-thing
treat my first like my last and my last like my first
and my thirst like the first song i sang

a little bit of everything a new improved russell
i say that reluctantly cause i do struggle
as you see i cant leave so i do love you
but im just a hustler disguised as a rapper
in fact you cant fit this hustle inside of a wrapper
back when crack was what these pills are
i was a real star complete with real cars
no video ones you can and come set up a camera
let the video run
in my real life complete with real ice
vvs boulders all invisibly set
head and shoulders my invisible neck
you see hova wasnt digital yet
b4 steve jobs made the ipod
was gettin head jobs we call that intimate

back when rappers wouldnt dare play lyrical roulette
with an automatic weapon i was rappin with a tek
fresh like manny b changed like antifreeze
shoe box full of cash
dealer man hand me keys
pantries full of arm n hammer
dont take nancy drew to see what it do
ima damn g
just sent a million dollars through a handsfree
thats big money talk can you answer me
before the answer was a 3 i was down in gerogetown with a hoya chick loya chick
sure hes rich now cause he saw this shit all this shit
thats why they call him hov cause he came before all this shit
bought a 6 quarter 7 skipped on them quarter 8s
bought a 9 for nonstop glockwork all the time
guess whos back
since this is a new era got a fresh new hat
10 yr veteran
i been said i been through with this bullshit game
but i never can
i used to think rappin at 38 was ill
when last year alone i grossed about 38 mill
i know i aint quite 38 but still
the flow so special got a 38 feel
the real is backyou are tuned in
to the greatest
young h-o-v
lets go get em again just
oh my god

pops sped off left mom with a bundle of
joy ya boy smacked dab in the jungle
took tunnel vision but he would soon become a mogul
but first he brought that crack back like a yo-yo
dont play with my yo-yo loco niggas in the hood
first niggas hating on me its all good
im buying things like my shit dont stink gucci links in gucci gooses
watching too many movies bulletproof this
had some nerve like pulling toothses
when your 16 coming through roofless
yea your boy ruthless like ice cube was
turn the whole city on im the new blood
so if this is your first time hearing this
youre about to experience someone so cold
a journey seldom seen the american dream
from the bottom to the top of the globe they call me hov

[chorus]
they gunning for me wanna see me fall
you know my story ive been through it all
nights ive felt like dying but i aint crying
what didnt kill me made me strong as iron
iron iron oh my god hov

now im knee deep in the concrete
like a streets made a quicksand its beyond deep
i got a chemical romance two left feet
so now i dance with the devil please g-o-d
save me from the black parade release me
my life like grant theft auto psp
im in that volvo puffing on that la-la
ducking from the po-po everytime i drive by
say hi to the bad guy all my mommas friends was like
mmm mmm mmm would you just look at him
so sorry dear momma for your embarrasment
but give me a couple years and pray ill never sin again
got all these rival dealers trying to do me in
and all these little rappers dont know how prepared for them i am i am
im feelin like the worlds against me lord
call me crazy but strangely i love the odds

[chorus]

now these baby ballers toy rappers/toy wrappers
callin out my name to bring the boy backwards
shooting air-balls at the basket

uh huhpeaceuh uh uh uh
its not a diss song its just a real song
feel me

i heard motherfuckers saying they made hov
made hov say ok so make another hov
niggaz wasnt playing they day role
so we parted ways like ben and j-lo
i shoulda been did it but i been in a daze though
i put friends over business end of the day though
but when friends business interests as they go
aint nothing left to say though
i guess we forgot what we came fo
shoulda stayed in food and beverage
too much flossing
too much sam rothstein
i aint a bitch but i gotta divorce them
hov have to get the shallow shit up off him
and i aint even want to be famous
niggaz is brainless to unnecessarily go through these changes
and i aint even know how it came to this
except that fame is
the worst drug known to man
its stronger than heroin
when you could look in the mirror like there i am
and still not see what youve become
i know im guilty of it too but not like them
you lost one

[chorus w/ chrisette michele jay-z]
lose one let go to get one
left one lose some to win some you lost one
story of a champion sorry im a champion
you lost one

i dont think its meant to be be
but she loves her work more than she does me
and honestly at twenty-three
i would probably love my work more than i did she
so we aint we
its me and her
cause what she prefers over me is work
and thats where we differ
so i have to give her
free time even if it hurts
so breathe mami its deserved
youve been put on this earth to be
all you can be like the reserves
and me my time in the army its served
so i have to allow she her time to serve
the times now for her
in time shell mature
and maybe we can be we again like we were
finally my times too short to share
and to ask her now it aint fair
so yeah she lost one

lose one let go to get one
left one lose some to win some oh yeah she lost one
story of a champion sorry im a champion
you lost one

my nephew died in the car i bought
so im under the belief its partly my fault
close my eyes and squeeze try to block that thought
place any burden on me but please not that lord
time dont go back it go forward
cant run from the pain go towards it
some things cant be explained what caused it
such a beautiful soul so pure shit
gonna see you again im sure of it
til that time little man im nauseous
your girlfriends pregnant the lords gift
almost lost my faith that restored it
its like having your life restarted
cant wait for your childs life to be a part of it
so now im child-like waiting for a gift
to return when i lost you i lost it

lose one let go to get one
left one lose some to win some colleek i lost one
story of a champion colleek youre a champion

thanks for the look of love
just as i was leavin
some nights you thought that i wouldnt come back

as a man i apoligize for my dad

[verse 1]
paparazzi spots me in the lobby of my high rise
i hide behind my shades because the fame is blindin my eyes
my god i know how ozzy oz must have felt when he was oz hot
as i have got i have got to make this stop
people often warn me that the fame aint for the faint of heart
itll change those cause if they had love for you into strangers
when the fame starts its a chain reaction 
locomotion like when a train departs
stranger things have happened 
rappin stackin platinum plaques
born in brooklyn got a place in manhattan
goin back to brooklyn to escape the madness
when your friends is chris &amp; gwyneth when your girl is more famous than juventus
then its time to get all your windows tinted
keep your eyes squinted its gon flash any minute
the music biz is like musical chairs
its about where you stand when the music stop spinnin


[chorus]

[beyonce]

the damage here along the gulf coast is catastrophic
theres a frantic effort under way tonight to find
survivors there are an uncounted number of the dead tonight
people are being forced to live like animals
we are desperate
no one says the federal government is doing a good job
and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people
no water i fought my country for years
we need help we really need help
in baghdad they they drop they air drop water food to peoplewhy cant they do that to their own people
the same idiots that cant get water into a major american city in less than three days are trying to
win a war

[verse 1 - jay-z]
people was poor before the hurricane came
but the down pour poured is like when mary j sang
every day it rains so every day the pain
but ignored them and showed em the risk was to blame
for life is a chain cause and effected
niggas off the chain because they affected
its a dirty game so whatever is effective
from weed to selling kane gotta put that in effect
wouldnt you loot if you didnt have the loot
baby needed food and you stuck on the roof
helicopter swooped down just to get a scoop
through his telescopic lens but he didnt scoop you
the next five days no help ensued
they called you a refugee because you seek refuge
the commander-in-chief just flew by
did he stop no he had a couple seats
just proved jet blue hes not
jet flew by the spot
what if he ran out of jet fuel and just dropped
huthat woulda been something to watch
helicopters doing fly-bys to take a couple of shots
couple of portraits then ignored em
hed be just another bush surrounded by a couple orchids
poor kids just cause they were poor kids
left em on they porches same old story in new orleans
silly rappers because we got a couple porches
mtv stopped by to film our fortresses
we forget the unfortunate
sure i ponied up a mill but i didnt give my time
so in reality i didnt give a dime or a damn
i just put my monies in the hands of the same people that left my people stranded
nothin but a bandit
left them folks abandoned
damn that money that we gave was just a band-aid
cant say we better off than we was before
in synopsis this is my minority report
cant say we better off than we was before
in synopsis this is my minority report

[verse 2 - ne-yo]
so many times im covering my eyes
peeking through my fingers
tryin to hide my frustration at the way that we treat
seems like we dont even care
turn on the tv seein the pain
sayin such a shame
then tryin to go on with my life
of that i too am guilty
seems like we dont even care
so we send a lil money tell em its alright
to be able to sleep at night
you will pay that price
while some of these folks lost their whole life
seems like we dont even care
now it wasnt on the nightly news no more
suddenly it didnt matter to you no more
in the end almost nothing changed
what the hell what was that for
seems like we dont even care

[outro news excerpts]

in hopes that shell be ok
and when im no longer here

everyday hit every wave like im hawaiian
i dont surf the net
no i never been on myspace
too busy letting my voice vibrate
carving out my space
in this world of fly girls
cut throats in diamond cut ropes i twirls
business round corners where the sun dont shine
i let the wheels give a glimpse of hope in ones grind
some said hov how you get so fly
i said from not being afraid to fall out the sky
my physicals a shell so when i say farewell
my soul will find an even higher plane to dwell
so fly you shall so have no fear

im the thinnest cut slice
intercut the winners cup
where winters rough enough to interrupt life
thats why im both saint and sinnernice
this is jay every day no compromise
no compass comes with this life just eyes
so to map it out you must look inside
sure books can guide you but your heart defines you chica
the corazón is what brought us home
in great shape like heidi klum maricon i am on
permanent vaca life is but a beach chair
songs like a hallmark card until you reach here
so till shes here
and shes declared
the heir
i will prepare
a blueprint for you to print a map for you to get back
a guide for your eyes 
so you wont lose scent
ill make a stink for you to think 
i ink these verses
full of prose so you wont get conned out of 2 cents
my last will and testament i leave my heir
my share of roc-a-fella records and a shiny new beach chair

this is food for thought you do the dishesmind state of a gangster from the 40s
meets the business mind of motowns berry gordy
turned crack rock into a chain of the 40/40s
sorry my jewelry is so gaudy
slid into the party with my new pair of mauris
america meet the gangster shawn correy
hey young world wanna hear a story
close your eyes and you can pretend youre me
im cut from the cloth of the kennedys 
frank sinatra havin dinner with the genovese
this is the genesis of a nemesis
mother america not witnessed since
the harlem renaissance birthed black business
this is the tale of lost innocence
and the incense burns and the turntables turn
and that al green plays
i see my mothers afro
as mama taps her toes
as she rolls her js
and my papa just left the house
in search of a killer of my uncle ray
and shes trying to calm her nerves 
as i observe this is just one day
and what tomorrow has in store
we can never be sure
as all we can do is pray

as i head to my homeroom
i observe the ruins
dope needles on the ground
i hear a car go vroom
drug dealer in the bm with the top down
as the girls start to giggle
i ask why you laugh
they say youre too little
one day youll understand
when you become a man
bout things you have to get you

fast forward freeze frame
on my pistol fistful of dollars
ignorance is so blissful
i aint choose this life
this life chose me 
around here its the sh*t
that you just do
i just left school
the same bm is pulled over
by the boys dressed blue
they had their guns drawn
screaming just move
or is there something else you suggest we can do
he made his way to the trunk
opened it like huh
a treasure chest was removed
cops said hell be back next month
what we call corrupt
he calls payin dues
now when the rules is blurred
as they is and were
what am i supposed to do but pray

pray the lord forgive me 
pray he guides me for what im bout to go through
pray

anywhere theres oppression
the drug profession
flourishes like beverages
refreshing sweet taste of sin
everything  i seen made me everything i am
bad drug dealer of victim i beg
what came first
moving chickens of the egg
this is why i be so fresh
im trying to beat life
cause i cant cheat death
treat shame like shamelessness
aim stainless at anuses
you know the game this is
move coke like pepsi
dont matter what the brand name is
i stand behind mine
everything i do im a man behind mine
im not an angel im sure
but every night before i lay
i drop my knees to the floor
and i praydreamed of you this morning
then came the dawn and i thought you were here with me
if you could only see
how much i love you
thats all thats all thats all baby
oh no ill never give up on you
i never felt that before
but theres always
thats all thats all

this is the shit you dream about with the homie steamin out
back-back-backing them beemers out
seems as our plans to get a grant
then go off to college didnt pan or even out
we need it now we need a town
we need a place to pitch we need a mound
for now im just a lazy boy
big dreaming in my la-z-boy
in the clouds of smoke been playin this marvin
mama forgive me should be thinkin bout harvard
but thats too far away niggas are starving
aint nothin wrong with aim just gotta change the target
i got dreams of baggin snidd-ow the size of pillows
i see pies everytime my eyes clidd-ose
i see rides sixes i gotta get those
lifes a bitch i hope not to make her a widow

[chorus]
oh no ill never give up on you
i never felt that before
its just american dreamin
oh no ill never give up on you
i never felt that before
its just american dreamin
oh no ill never give up on you
i never felt that before
american dreamin
but theres always
thats all thats all

now see the lifes right there
and it seems right there
its not quite near
and its not like were professionals movin the decimals
know where to cop nah got a connect no
who under heaven know how to be successful
need a personal jesus im in depeche mode
they say its celestial its all in the stars
its like tony larussa
on how you play your cards
you all aint fucking with me
the ironies are
and at all costs better before he was bars
now lets start on your mark
get set lets go-get out the car
going in circles its a vicious cycle
this is a crash course this aint high school
wake up muttley youre dreamin again
your own reality show the season begins

[chorus]

step one in this process scramble up in your projects
and head to the heights where big coke is processed
you gotta convince em that you not from the precinct
please speak slow cause he no speakey no english
if he takes a liking after a couple of trips
if your money is straight hes gonna give you consignment
youre now in a game where only time can tell
survive the droughts i wish you well
survive the droughts i wish you well
how sick am i i wish you health
i wish you wheels i wish you wealth
i wish you insight so you could see for yourself
you could see the signs when the jackets is schemin
and the cops is comin you could read they mind
you could see from behind you could redefine
the game as we know it one dream at a time
im american dreamin

poor me dad was gone finally got my dad back

guidence i never had that streets was my second home
welcomed me with open arms provided a place to crash at
a place to study math at matter fact i learned it all

to live and die in ny in the hustle game
hustle caine hustle clothes or hustle music

but hustle hard in any hustle that you pick

through all the manure in the sewers that i grew up in
choi-ces we make trying to escape

and i dont need no hook for this shit

imma live and die with the decisions that imma pick
so f**k the haven for cave in thats why we dont speak
made men aint supposed to make statements
end of the story i followed the code cracked the safe
other niggas aint in the game so they practice hate

oh and i dont need no hook for this shitand the winner is hov my man
speech

oh what a feeling im feeling life
thanks to the lames niggas with bad aim
thanks to a little change ill tear you out the game

i figure frauds never hit a lick before
so they dont know the feeling when them things get across
put your hand out the window feel the force

and still theres pain
if i would have grew up to be a doctor my nephew would have grew up to do the same
but since i grew up through the game and my influence is the same
and my therapy is music they ask if you ashamed
and though i wish i could separate two things
i cannot so my answer to you remains
i can walk down the hall or mirrors in versailles
and be so satisfied when i look a myself in the eyes
no shame no sir just big boats and tearing the coast up
tight coup like im wearing the roadster
for any coup im bear hugging the holster

[chorus]
hov alright alright
and that may not be
what you call perfect
but but its my life
the life the life the life
once again its the life

[2nd verse]
so i make no apologies
crooked policies
so a g a nigga gotta be
we playing for property no monopoly
so ill pass go and let my nephew follow me
they say the child shall lead
so i take it far as i can and then we shall see
shall we dance with the devil for a beat
i pray to god i aint got two left feet
do the hustle put keys in the street
then im ballroom dancing ke-keing in the suite
sweet
bbs on the feet tvs in the seat
enemies on the creep
its so corrupt
soak it up
its a lesson never fuck up
one day youre up next day youre down
long as you stay the same it will come back around

[chorus]

[3rd verse]
im even better im eating better
best thing about it is my niggas eating together
with each endeavor

verse 1  jay z

beautiful music when champagne flutes click
beautiful women sippin throught rouge lips
dangers approaches were like wait whos this
let us save you some trouble son

you can lay in your casket just as you is
we appreciate the target practices
well be sure to send flower baskets kid

verse 3i was gonna kill a couple rappers
but they did it to themselves
i was gon do it with the flow
but they did it with their sales
i was gon 9/11 em but they didnt need the help
and they did a good job them boys is talented as hell
cuz not only did they brick they put a building up as well
they ran a plane into that building and when that building fell
ran to the crash site with no masks and inhaled
toxins deep inside their lungs until both of them was filled
blew a cloud out like a l into a jar then took a smell
cuz they heard that second hand smoke kills

yeah 3 in the morning on the westside highway top down baby fuck yall
the motivation for me was them telling me what i couldnt be oh well

jay-z
this a special dedication
i wanna thank you for the fuel
no really thank you

verse 1 - jay-z
i felt so inspired by what my teacher said
said id either be dead or be a reefer head
now sure if thats how adults should speak to kids
especially when the only thing i did was speak in class
ill teach his ass
even betters what my uncle did
i pop my demo tape in start to beat my head
peaked out my eye see if he was beating his
he might as well say beat it kid hes on the list
its like im searching for kicks like a sneaker head
he gon keep pushing me until i reach the ledge
and when i reach the ledge ill tell em all to eat a dick
take a leap of faith and let my eagle wings spread
spread spread

chorus - pharrell
motivation for me was them telling me what i could not be oh well
im so ambitious
i might hit two sisters
hey im on a mission
no matter what the conditions
forget the personal issues
when you been what i been through
hey if you believe it
then you could conceive it

verse 2 - jay-z
i had to lace up my boots even harder
father is too far away to father
further-more of the kids either smoke reefer
or either move white theres few writers in my cipher
so they made lighter my type a dreams seem dumb
they said wiser how many guys a you see making it from here
the world dont like us is that not clear a riper
im different i cant base what im gonna be off a what everybody isnt 
they dont listen just whispering behind my back
no vision lack of ambition
so wack

chorus

verse 3 - jay-z
had a couple of meetings no office yet
maybe i aint good enough for these offices
back to the drawing board ducking officers
its all good cause the streets is a&amp;ring this
so with or without any of your involvement
coming for all of this respect my conglomerate
i went from pauper to the president
every deal i made said president
niggas thought id fall without old buddy
oh buddy what i do is make more money
dear teacher your probably somewhere near a speaker
im balling outta control can you hear my sneakers
fuck yall

you see the motivation for me
was them telling me what i could not bemr hudson
lets dance in style
lets dance for a while
heaven can wait we’re only watching the skies
hoping for the best but expecting the worst
are you gonna drop the bomb or not
let us die young or let us live forever
we dont have the power but we never say never
sitting in a sandpit
life is a short trip
the musics for the sad man

forever young
i wanna be forever young
do you really want to live forever
forever and ever
forever young i wanna be

may the best of your todays
be the worst of your tomorrows
but we aint even thinking that far

when the sun is always out and you never get old
and the champagnes always cold
and the music is always good
and the pretty girls just happen to stop by in the hood
and they hop their pretty ass up on the hood of dat pretty ass car
without a wrinkle in today
cuz there is no tomorrow
just some picture perfect day
to last a whole lifetime
and it never ends
cos all we have to do is hit rewind
so lets just stay in the moment smoke some weed
drink some wine
reminisce talk some shit forever young is in your mind
leave a mark that cant erase neither space nor time
so when the director yells cut

through the darkest blocks over kitchen stoves
over pyrex pots my name shall be passed down to generations while debating up in barber shops

we can make love and make history
why wont you visit me until she visit me
ill be stuck with her sister her name is defeat
she gives me agony so much agony
she brings me so much pain so much misery
like missing your last shot and falling to your knees
as the crowd screams for the other team
i practiced so hard for this moment victory dont leave
i know what this means im stuck in this routine
whole new different day the same old thing
all i got is dreams nobody else can see
nobody else believes nobody else but me

hustling like a g while victory wasnt watching took chances repeatedly
as a teenage boy before acne before i got proactive i couldnt face she
i just threw on my hoody and headed to the street
i swear i met success we lived together shortly
now success was like lust shes good to the touch
shes good for the moment but shes never enough
everybodys had her she’s nothing like v
but success is all i got unfortunately
but im burning down the block hoping in and out of v
but something tells me there is much more to see
before i get killed cause i cant get robbed
so before me success and death ménage
i gotta get lost i gotta find v
we gotta be together to make history

future of my past thatll explain who ill be
rank me amongst the greats either one two or three
if i aint number one then ive failed you victory
aint in it for the fame that dies within weeks
aint in it for the money can take it when you leave
i want to be remembered long after you breathe
long after im gone long after i breathe

i die for my niggas and i love my cub hope thats not fucked up
i got a problem with the handouts i took the man route

ill give an opportunity though thats the plan now
no guilt in giving clear a nigga conscience out
no guilt in receiving every thing within reason
cant see it taking food out my little monsters mouth

that will drive me gaga
run up in your mamas house two nickels one dime
manslaughter charges the lawyer knocked it down
im just trying to find common ground

fore mr belafonte come and chop a nigga down
mr day o major fail
respect these youngins boy its my time now
hublot homie two door homie
you dont know all the shit i do for the homies

nickels and dimes
sticks to my mind
ill never win
you have my friends

pardon my hubris stanley kubrick
with eyes wide shut i could cook up two bricks
turn nickels to dime turn dimes to quarters
turn wives from daughters oh im clear as water

and just for clarity my presence is charity
my flow is a gift philanthropist
everybody around me rich or will be
baby boy i promise you this or kill me

and when a nigga go as the old adage go
you die rich or you die a disgrace so just let me grow
watch me cook throw no looks
like magic in his prime when kareem sky hooked

the greatest form of giving is anonymous to anonymous
so here yall go i promise thisladies and gentlemen

bulletproof this radio scanners you got scanners we got scanners

boy from the hood but got white house clearance
sorry yall i dont agree with yall parents
politicians never did shit for me
except lie to me distort history

fine let me commit a real crime
i might buy a kilo for chief keef
out of spite i just might flood these streets
hear the freedom in my speech
got an onion from universal read it and weep
wouldve brought the nets to brooklyn for free
except i made millions off it you fuckin dweeb
