them niggas who shot em got em for ten bricks
fuckin dominicans turned around and gave em more bricks

chorus

that first verse is just a dose of the shit that im on
consider this the first chapter in the ghettos quran
i know a lot of niggas that get dough like remmy and joe
and prince and rightous from hillside with the mole on his nose
throughout my struggles through the hood i started learnin
lifes a bitch with a pretty face but she burnin
man im a get cheese like chaz then run through wips like cigar
gamble all the time like country-curly head prince and tata
po-po under pressure too they know what they facin
go against crews like b-bo and killers like patty mason
a lotta niggas i know been corrupted since birth
enticed to rob nuns for fun for everything they worth
i know some cats that hail at old complexes like cooley wall
together niggas stand and divided they fall
round here shook niggas they keep it in motion
come around here with your rollie you can get robbed like ocean
lord knows tommy had loved and sold
helicopters rolls royces with louis vuitton interior

montanna was no dummy brought benice to watch the money
had money out the ass he politic like the asian
feds couldnt catch him dirty so settled for tax evasion

chorus

yo rest in peace to rich and ron money what they was about yo

hey this life is hard man i know dont remind me

it aint even safe to sell a pack at night
got task ridin round the projects on mountain bikes

chorus - repeat 2x
ny aint the same its ot playa
you can go and cop coke from the corner bodega
hit the highway and take it to a town near you
and get that money man get that money man

chorus
lord forgive me for ive sinned
over and over again just to stay on top
i recall memories filled with sin
over and over again and again

for all you slow muthafuckas im a break it down iller
see preme was a business man and prince was the killer
remember he used to push the bulletproof bm uh huh
this here get ya seasick i sat back and peeped shit
the roll with easy rider and they aint get blunted
had the whole projects workin for fifty on five-hundred
as a youth all i ever did was sell crack
i used to idolize cat
heart me in my heart to hear that nigga snitched on pat how he go out like
that
rumors in the hood was  was snitchin
i aint believe that pa he helped me cop my first gsx-r
had the four-runner the z the 5 and the 3
used to drive his truck through the hood draggin jet skis
from gerald wallace to baby wise dont be suprised
of how freely i thought of names of games who dealt with pies
like l-a-n-ys l got shot in the neck then told us connect
them niggas who shot em got em for ten bricks
fuckin dominicans turned around and gave em more bricks

chorus

that first verse is just a dose of the shit that im on
consider this the first chapter in the ghettos quran
i know a lot of niggas that get dough like remmy and joe
and prince and rightous from hillside with the mole on his nose
throughout my struggles through the hood i started learnin
lifes a bitch with a pretty face but she burnin
man im a get cheese like chaz then run through wips like cigar
gamble all the time like country-curly head prince and tata
po-po under pressure too they know what they facin
go against crews like b-bo and killers like patty mason
a lotta niggas i know been corrupted since birth
enticed to rob nuns for fun for everything they worth
i know some cats that hail at old complexes like cooley wall
together niggas stand and divided they fall
round here shook niggas they keep it in motion
come around here with your rollie you can get robbed like ocean
lord knows tommy had loved and sold
helicopters rolls royces with louis vuitton interior
might sound like im fantasizin but son im dead serious
montanna was no dummy brought benice to watch the money
had money out the ass he politic like the asian
feds couldnt catch him dirty so settled for tax evasion

chorus

yo rest in peace to rich and ron money what they was about yo
the twins was some queens but got crazy cream with alpo
throughout my time i heard tales of himey frenchy jamaican pauly ducky
cally
rodney bump and chick shit
a lot a niggas flow the way i flow
but aint been in the game all their life so dont know who i know
writin rhymes is the best way i express how i feel
if i aint rich by twenty-six ill be dead or in jail
comin up i heard sippin to much boozell leave you confused
and if you watch the news you see playas in this game that lose
im forgettin lefty and jazz pretty tony and lance
head lou mel son troy and e money bags
and a conversation over shrimp and lobster
and benny hiners heard chico stopped boxin and started robbin diners

if the flow dont kill you the mac will

intro she loves me she loves me not - yeah - she loves me not

the fiends need me; i aint around they bones ache
detox rehab cold sweats - watch em shake
im not that genie-in-a-bottle; im in a bag
take one hitand slide off to the land of h man
when we first met i thought youd never doubt me
now you tryin to leave me youll never live without me
girl im missin you come and see me soon
tie your arm up put that lighter under that spoon
now put that needle to your arm princessstick it in
relapse im back bitch dont ever try that again
all the shit i did for youi made you feel good
we have a love thing; you treatin this like its just a fling
what we have is more sacred than a vow or a ring
you broke my heart you dirty bitch i wont forget what you did
if you give birth ill already be in love with your kids
listen i dont give a damn if your ass start smokin
but we have a bond and its not to be broken

hook
we got a love thing; girl you tryin to leave me but you need me - can you see youre addicted to me
we got a love thing; i can take you higher girl f**kin wit me you can be all you can be 2x

baby you knowon the low your sister been eyein me
im good lookin so you know  soon shell be tryin me
i heard she bisexual; she f**k with that girl
but boy oh boy f**kin wit me is a whole nother world
after the first night shell fall in love and then chase the feelin
i hung out with marvin when he wrote sexual healing
kurt cobainwe been good friends ozzy osbourne too


i been with rock stars - see you lucky im f**kin wit you
i chilled with frankie lyman and jimi hendrixs crew
see this is new to you but to me this aint new
i live the lavish life listen if the mood is right

i never steer you wrong; you hyper i make you calm
ill be your incentive a reason for you to move on

even if it means youll have to sell your mamas tv
i love you love me back - no one said lovin me be easy

hook 2x

i love you
i got you bare-footed on glass chasin a dove
that monkey on your back symbolizes my love
your friends talk bad about me bitchyou sit there and listen to em
over and over you hurt me my love is unconditional
they talk to you when you up; you down they got nuthin to say
but when you call ill come runnin ill always take the pain away
they set you up to let you down; they crowned you prom queen
they know about me; behind your back they call you a f**kin fiend
can we just be alone so i can kiss and hug you
push me inside you no other man can love you like i do
call me daddy; ill make you feel good - i mean real good
i find pleasure in pleasing you like a real man should
it was written long before us; it was carved in a tree
forever me and you baby we were meant to be
theres more to life than laughter - what brought us together was fate
and well be hand in hand when you walk through those pearly gates
and to see to that ima do whatever it takes

[verse 1]
heres a taste of my life its bitter and sweet
i put my heart out to the sounds of the drums and the beat
i put my life on the line when im out on the street
put my teflon on and roll with my heat
i keep my circle nice and small i dont f**k with these clown niggas
in a race for the cheese i run laps around niggas
soon as i step on stage the crowd applauds
soon as my sneaker wear in stores reebok stocks sore
i aint gotta say im a boss niggas can tell
the east coast crib the size of a small hotel
the shit journalist write about me get me confused
have me feelin like the heavy weight champ when he lose

shady murdered him another virgin he just hit his mark
he met his quota for the month they found dakota all rolled up
inside a bag he probably dragged the body for about a block
disappeared without a trace no dna no not a drop

csi they hate us but they gotta give a lot of props
the drama pops grab the butcher knife from off the counter top

[chorus]

pistols and bad bitches
hustlers and bad business
rapping was just a hobby that hobby turned to a million
had that oxy on sale
you can get it 50 a pill
sniff it or let it grill
rap the foil you know the drill
money power and drugs
my only reason to love
never played cops and robbers nigga we played crips and bloods
like to the pimps saying who the sluts
211 on hookers purses
another double up purchase
slanging a hundred meters from churches
god forgive me but the steal was worth it
man i swear i needed some change chains and golden rings and thangs
niggas watch videos and think them dudes went from rags to hardest
for real lokes know that type of thing makes you a target
either the pigs or im gonna get you while you playing boy
hold you like an animal
strapped with a bean thats adam braun

i say id rather relapse
than reenact curtis and put that work in
