and that kimono that i bought you on my trip to japan
sunshine peekin through the venetian blinds
four years and like wine you got fine over time

i mean real bad girl im talking rougher than rough
do you think itd be enough if we just had us
dont answer quick think about it cause im askin for real
gold diggers goin to hear this song drivin and crash at the wheel
forever is a long time so far we gettin along fine
no car i ever drove no ice i ever saw
no music i ever made aint nothin i wanted more
we could deal with whatever together
sunshine or that other weather when we chasin forever

chorus

i wanna stay with you forever
i wanna spend all my life with only you
i wanna stay lets stay together
chasing forever with only you

verse 2

chasin forever a buck-wild endeavor it seems
are we pursuin somethin real or just chasin a dream
or casin the scene
fore i die i plan
to see us holding eternity in the palm of our hands
now as a man theres certain things im lackin for sure
but im committed to growin and coming at you mature
in the future i know it aint gonna be all good
but when we feelin the hurt if we willin to work
the eight ball will never turn to see us behind
though i aint no knight and my armor dont shine
my mom said the linchpin of love is trust
an taught me monogamy is a monoga-must
a plus for you dinner by candlelight
now dont commit before you sure you understand me right
its a race to a strange place most see never
its a chase we gotsta make together forever

chorus

verse 3

now you would think after all my heartbreaks id be cruel
hiding behind my ego evil but no
much the contrary im very much certain
you searchin for joy its on the other side of hurtin
finally found a person worthy of all
instead of pushin me down you wanna cushion my fall
your eyes could make the sun rise all the birds sing
seal it with a kiss bind it with a ring
more carats than even bugs could eat in a week
and the ribbon in the sky close your eyes dont peek
ill tell you what i see in the future
a hacienda so cute with five little kids callin you mom and callin me dad
havin more good times than jj had
judging by the look in your eyes you see it
let no man sever welcome to forever

packin my purse but yo without one curse
i survive in rarefied air where only few can live
thoughts in my brain like that train in the fugitive
i pledge allegiance to the soul of the game
stepped away as fresh prince came back with my real name
a rose by any other still beautifies the room
so dont get consumed when a brothers nom de plume
its semantics but yo its really good to be back
never racing the rap just lacing the track
not serendipity with me it was a plan b
gots to have an oscar standin next to my grammiesss
plural mucho no need to talk though
im a just do so
im comin at ya with the smoothest slickness
behold the style lick of this kickin

chorus

verse 3

outside of rap got the cream and all that
but kinda left a void in me
you cant keep runnin in and out of my life
said my mic

pump your radio you could record
as they place my welcome mat at the music awards
coming through america tinted in high beams
rose petals at my feet like im prince akeem
so to all you player haters while yall sayin yall rhyme
please stop sayin jada cause that names mine
i rocked the philly fade with the divin waves
yes yallin till im bald like issac hayes
bad eyes or greys
back pain or bad legs
im a get better with age trust

chorusi thought you was the one hon yeah
when i met you at the freak nik
whoever thought youd be the type to greet and keep secrets
my friends said dont sleep but i did so now im reapin
da seeds that i sowed i cant believe you so deceivin
sneakin out on the weekends with michelle
one of your freak friends from the east end she bad as hell
half black and indonesian the one that taught you treason
cupid shoot me on my heart but damn whyd you leave it bleedin

i gave you no reason to lie
but you choose to live untrue
knowing how i feel inside
theres no telling what i might do
cause i gave you

chorus

all my mind
all my soul
from the very start
i gave you full control and you broke my heart
i tried to show you a better way of life
but i see that must be what you like
i loved you more than anything
i tried to build the future turn a house into a home
i wanted us to be one flesh and one bone
its so hard to keep my sanity
now i can do is sit back and reminisce
look at the pictures in the frames yo
why you playin games yo

as i think back to the begining we was together
we both loved sports long walks and autumn weather
both wanted kids and a family a strong personality
i liked the way you handled me
candles be lit mood set food set you ready yet
thats what you said while you was massagin my head
now look here i could never leave you lonely
cause the love you showed me had me feeling like you already had known me
member when you used to blindfold me till i dont see
use your mind thats what you told me
kissin me slowly
never was the loud type always on the low key
pretty style but rugged
and damn i brother i loved it

the birds of a feather sposed to fly together
guess that dont apply to birds of your kind
cause you only wanted what you wanted like a poacher
came to steal my heart and leave me to die
i aint going out like that though

chorusyeah this is keith b rizzeal

but yo the cream can only finance the smile for a little while
my grin got longevity got family backin me
thats why im livin happily

chorus to fadenow dad this is a very sensitive subject
from the first time the doctor placed you in my arms
i knew id meet death before id let you be harmed
although questions arose in my mind would i be man enough
against wrong choose right and be standin up
from the hospital that first night
took a hour just to get the car-seat in right
people drivin all fast got me kinda upset
got you home safe placed you in your basonette
that night i dont think one wink i slept
as i slipped out my bed to your crib i crept
touched your head gently felt my heart melt
cause i knew i loved you more than life itself
then to my knees and i begged the lord please
let me be a good daddy all he needs
love knowledge discipline too
i pledge my life to you

chorus

chorus

verse 3

its a full-time job to be a good dad
you got so much more stuff than i had
i gotta study just to keep with the changin times
101 dalmations on your cd-rom

but yo aint nuthin promised one day ill be gone
feel the strife but trust life does go on
but just in case
its my place
to impart
one day some girls gonna break your heart
and ooh aint no pain like from the opposite sex
gonna hurt bad but dont take it out on the next son
throughout life people will make you mad
disrespect you and treat you bad
let god deal with the things they do
cause hate in your heart will consume you too
always tell the truth say your prayers
hold doors pull out chairs easy on the swears
youre living proof that dreams come true

envisioned a hot life hot wife
wanted a crib well a palace like south fork on dallas
with lights simmer trees for the ambiance
i been up and down and high and low
fly with dough broke looking grimy yo
my shiny glow definitely aint cause of my bentley
its something that my fam put in me

in the past cut twice by the ladies of my life
and the wounds stitched up by my wife

afro angel off your pedestal from perchin above
you on the prowl now downtown searchin for love
in all the wrong places outside your radio stations
hopin he with new hit single is tryin to mingle
today he is me in your town puttin it down
you in the car with your friends followin my limo around
puttin a bug in my boys ear your s is for free
youll do anything for omar or phil bring you to me
and then me hypnotized by the devil as well
hold out my hand as an invitation into my hotel
no need to rsvp place your hand in my palm
as all your girlfriends getting jealous  damn she landed the bomb
willing to trade your spirit for some crass whack wage
something small something simple as a pass back stage
but now i lay me down to creep
and i - pray the lord my soul to keep

chorus
afro angel born against the world
you dont have to sell your soul and throw away your pride
afro angel sent from heaven above
never forget that you are loved
you know that you are loved

lil bobby got a gun now age fifteen
destined to spend his life inside a cage it seems
rage inside pride been denied respect
he cant take it though he gotta earn it
but he aint learned that yet
out on the town reckless abandon hes been bullied before
but now he straps so no more
attitude high
flexin on every guy that walk by
but dont start pal
asif the gun came from the whiz cowardly lion got heart now
lets pull it on a stranger
ahh fun for the crew
surprised when he realized damn dude got one too
smiles upside down now games aint so cute
bobbys a deer in a headlights
pumk drop it or ill shoot
then like a sniper cleanin his rifle bobby disobeys his commands
one shot rings out gunshot then only the stranger stands
could of sworn bobbys blood formed the shape of an angels wings
but for what

chorus
afro angel born against the world
you dont have to sell your soul and throw away your pride
afro angel sent from heaven above
never forget that you are loved
you know that you are loved

back in high school tamika was the sweetest the bomb
hot to death though in tenth grade a teenage mom
knocked up by some thug named russ in the drug game
but had the cutest kid you ever seen
then off of pressure from her mom
she stepped to russ
said its either them drugs or us
either them thugs or us
the ultimatum either continue bein a thug in the world
or start lovin your girl
and say god bear me witness no doubt lovin ya dear
but to go from 50 gs a week to 30 gs a year
that aint happenin
i guess he wasnt that strong
he came back the next week and the whole family was gone
yo they straight moved away without as little as a word
well needless to say russ was a little perturbed
then in a fury put the pressure on her girlfriend shawn
and like a clumsy chef she spilled the beans on where they had gone

upstate schenectady
tamika answered the door
it was the last person she expected to be
they just stared
he said you love me for me
you can do without the cars vacations and jewelry
down with me
period
through lifes stress and strife
she said yeah he said in that case
would you please be my wife
then like a sign from the sky the baby cried
like an angel sings
i love yall more than anything

chorus
afro angel born against the world
you dont have to sell your soul and throw away your pride
afro angel sent from heaven above
never forget that you are loved
you know that you are loved

im missing your kiss and now a tear drop glistens
i had a bit to drink kinda threw me

you know me baby im still that same man
that asked for your hand and still the same plan

another brother falls by the wayside
another brother falls by the play side

i knew ever since i was a kid
that i was going to pay the piper for the things i did
but now theres no more us no more we
no more nuthin girl damn and its all cuz of me

***chorus***
no more late nights watching tv
no more talks on the phone till three
no more playing in the leaves in the fall
no more piggy back rides in the mall
no more ice cream cones to share
no more sittin just playin in your hair
no more picnics out by the sea
there aint no more nuthin and its all cuz of me

damn some brothers yeah we huff and we puff
cuz when were hurtin inside we gots to front like we tuff
but thats dangerous to cover hurt with hard
because you still get scared through that feeble facade
then the bonds of your ego when the shackles of manhood
makes you lose something thats damn good
a picture in my mind of us hand and hand walking
so alive now im a dead man talking
why cant you just pick it up so we can sit and just talk
why cant i meet you somewhere so we can go take a walk

rap to my own sitcom
now i just sit calm
watching yall respond to my july 4th bomb boom
yeah im a nice kid
but heres some advice kid
dont get me hyped
ill set it off like my wife did
playing down a path like sajak
wheel of a fortune away
price aint right i dont play
find yourself in jeopardy
the first clue
what is will smith
hot to death not you
im like a porsche you a pinto
you like a tiny figurine im monumental
youre like a small get together
on your neighbors back porch
you know just a couple of yall
im a million man march
attack of the man in black
like jordan playing on a train
yo my game on track
mad ice for my wife
no care for what it costed
had to ease up though
her wrist got frost bit
my style flava delivery my diction
gettin medieval like dude in pulp fiction
you want some bring it
come one come all come in
watch me take they heart away like penny
i could take 12 rappers and put em in line
then 12 emcees that think they can rhyme
then 12 more brothers that still aint signed
then dont do nothing just watch em decline
gangsta hardcore menace to society
raps all the same
my pen spits variety
eclecticism is a virtue
it may not be a word
but its definitely a virtue
rappers approaching me all across america
believe me you dont wanna battle like erykah
i was in the game before publishing was an issue
youre platinum now but next year im gonna miss you
mad rappers like bad actors should have no parts
wanna be mad check the charts any of them
oh you dont see my name

heres a hint
look closer to the top

kel spencer

and me keepin me jig with it
play no games
thirst to heat the rhyme
motivation cause procrastination is the thief of time
holding a torch
i was programmed to scorch
cant run with the big dawgs
then stay on the porch
these cats is craftmatic
hand on the steering wheel
rocks from the road dodging oncoming traffic
man-handle rappers dismantle rappers
yall lukewarm slash sweet-scented candle rappers
any team posing a threat we defeat those
the wealthy man is the man that knows how to keep dough
as long as yall play foul imma keep hittin free throws
crush spanish mamis calling me kellito
remember lego blocks
all about the paper now
i use writers block to build sky scraper style
catch rappers using the same flows everyday cause they lame
true players gotta change their uniform after the game
yall seen the flow
like yall never seen before
dont stop for the door
why do you think green mean gold
baby learn lifes lessons
scratch regression

the little rain drops fallin down on me
but i cant seem to feel like feel like
feel like coming over me

will smith
the rain gon come through the window pain will come
black white rich poor its the same old drum
rainy days like the war use wisdom as a weapon
hold your head up dry your clothes and keep steppin
let the children feel the rain cause if they feel the rain
from the wetness they stand to gain
i came into the game it felt like the middle of june
music was warm artists like flowers they bloom
then boom i shook the room many felt the thunder
my time to shine did it like summer
i wondered if the sun would shine forever
pops said rain gon come to him i said never
chedder in the genes face on screens
got a benz wit the sheen but what did it all mean
i earned money and burned money credit cards smokin
platinumn grammys famous but still broke and
not having cash put me in check
yo the road to the riches is slippery when wet
amongst the fall is where you truly find yourself
ever since then the rain i never felt
deal wit it

chorus

will smith
at age seventeen the worst pain a hurrcaine
her first name still conjuers the rain
vowed to never let nobody ever get me wet
lest we forget love is a four season concept
many say the rain they cant stand
never let the weather determine the man
god has a plan from it i never ran
follow my heart through the storm my umbrella in hand
im noah lifes my arc
forty days and forty nights still cant take my heart
seen the fallen man
to dope and liquor brands
the devilll dance to make it rain
bringing the pain
walk through the puddles of struggle on flooded streets
soakin wet but mastered the art of peace
through grey skies i grew wise on bended knees i knelt
since then the rain i never felt
whats wit it

chorus

will smith
sometimes i sit in my room stuff on my mind
stress cant rest so i open the blinds
see kids in the streets runnin around
it wasnt touchin em but the rain was comin down
i wondered how with my mouth wide
reminisce of the key said i wanna go outside
in the rain to see if the same would happen to me
bout that time god started rappin to me
he said pain is the mother of change the rain must flow
so the seeds of joy might grow
dont be afraid find shelter in me
the road to greatness through the valley of adversity
i felt the light as he proceeded to drop the gem
these little children the world we must receive like them
i just smiled and thanked him for the cards he delt
and since then the rain i never felt
was wit it

chorusi believe in god
i believe in destiny
not destiny in the sense of all of our exerts being pre-determined
but destiny in the sense of our ability to choose
our ability to choose who we are and who we are supposed to be

yo yo yoyo 

i was born to reign
point blank
my name to be ecthed in stone
my destiny pre-ordaned
tryin to live richteous
fightin for life tis my life
thats why i liked on my vices
tightnin the vices of truth on the roofless
this is rhyme and the crime and their minds is just useless
the path of the poison the genesis of the genisi
you and your boyz tryin to decide what to write
but your hand is a sword and the blade has been forged
young minds gettin gorged stakes have been altered
by lick or by weed and then hate gets exaltered


as art falls to greed choices is made thats the voices is laid
on the track contract the soldier wage did you see his new benz but your like a syringe now proud of your binge

got a lot of new friends got a lot of new ends
bought a house up in the hills frontin shouts to the pen
givin false accounts of your accounts amounts
amounts the fans treason stands to reason since your inception
laced with deception and bred with false affection it must perish
from the terrace i see the fire burnin the streets but i wont shield my eyes to the heat
born to reign

at 17 years old i startin runnin the streets 
man i had some fun in the streets 
11 12 sometimes 1 in the streets 
by 18 i started seein the sun in the streets 
my mom started trippin on me like will you gotta choose your friends carefully like 
i trust you but please call me 
and when you have kids of your own youll see 
im a be here when all your friends wont 
but i was busy hollerin parents just dont understand 
now here i am with the family runnin the lines she ran on me 
we aint always see eye to eye but ma on your principles now i rely 
you got me tastin my toes 

i didnt know 
when my momma told me dont go down that road dont go down that road 
but i gotta go where i gotta go 
so thank you for not tellin me i told you so 

i used to roll hard with this dude named chuck 
rollin in my car with this dude named chuck 
my mommy really liked this dude named chuck 
she thought that he was really impolite 
chuck and me used to roll out faithfully 
ineviatably you see chuck you gonna see me 
like we on tv the buzzomest of buddies 
share full clothes and money 
and hunnies flocked like we was players from the nba 
still hurts to recall the day i heard him say 
to this girl named maya 
i was datin 
he told her i was a lier 
joker hatin 
he told her i be cheatin on women breakin hearts and grinnin 
he told her her life would be better without him in it 
thats the friend i chose 

i didnt know 
when my momma told me dont go down that road dont go down that road 
but i gotta go where i gotta go 
so thank you for not tellin me i told you so 

momma used to say take your time young man 
i aint gonna always be there holdin your hand 
but youll always know exactly where i am 
and when im not there in my place the lord will stand 
will study the world only the wise suceed 
and when your eyes tell lies your heart should leave 
you gonna do dirt we all gonna sin but when you realize and apologize and never do it again 
ma told me dont rush to get old 
if you got youth the truth clutched in your hold 
its like possibilities too much to behold an emotional shield from lifes blustery cold 
ma all the stuff was hard you said was hard 
childish disregard because my head was hard 
now no question to pose 
i didnt know 
when my momma told me dont go down that road dont go down that roadbut 
but i gotta go where i gotta go 
so thank you for not tellin me i told you solisten homeboys dont mean to bust your bubble
but girls of the world aint nothing but trouble
so next time a girl gives you the play
just remember my rhyme and get the hell away

just last week when i was walking down the street
i observed this lovely lady that i wanted to meet
i walked up to her i said hello
she said youre kind of cute i said yes i know
but by the way sweetheart whats your name
she said my friends like to call me exotic elaine
i said my name is the prince and she said why
i said well i dont know im just a hell of a guy
but enough about me yo lets talk about you
and all the wonderful things that you and i can do
i popped some cash and in a little bit of time
i showed some cash and the girl was mine
i took her over town i wined her and dined her
she ask me did i like her i said well kinda
all of a sudden she jumped out her seat
snatched me up by my wrist and took me out to the street
she started grabbin all over me kissing and hugging
so i shoved her away i said you better stop buggin
she got mad looked me dead in my face
threw her hands in the air and yelled out rape
i got scared when she started to yell
so i handed her my wallet and ran like hell
i was duckin through alleys right and left
but when the cops caught up they almost beat me to death
i was arrested charged with agrivated assault
yo clancy we got him
but it wasnt my fault

nevertheless dont mean to bust your bubble
but girls of the world aint nothing but trouble
so next time a girl gives you the play
just remember my rhyme and get the hell away

i was in a bar one friday night
cooling watching a mike tyson fight
i was maxin and relaxin sippin on tequilla
when this girl walked up she said hi my name is sheila
i responded by saying hello
she paid for my drink and then said lets go
20 minutes later things were starting to cook
as we pulled up into her house i said im with you toots
the music was soft and there was wine in the glasses
she started winking and making little passes
at me she pat me close thats when she got bold
she started feeling up my back i said oh your hands are cold
we went to her bedroom thinking of one thing
took the phone off the hook to avoid the annoying ring
i carresed her body and i kissed her cheek
and thats when i observed those satin bed sheets
i felt that it was time for me to make my move
i thought i better hurry up before i busted a groove
i leaned down to kiss her but then out of the blue
a door slammed and a voice said baby where are you
her boyfriend busted in he grinned an evil grin
and said boy im a tear your butt limb from limb
i was scared as hell where i was supposed to go
i just yelled geronimo and jumped out the window
just my luck we were in a snow storm
and all i had was my underwear on to keep my warm
and to top the night off i had to break in my place
because my keys were on pants back on sheilas book case
i was done sneezing and coughing 
i hope this doesnt happen to often

but nevertheless dont mean to bust your bubble
but girls of the world aint nothing but trouble
so next time a girl gives you the play
just remember my rhymes and get the hell away

jazzy man first your parents just dont understand then you having these crazy nightmares
prince i know why me man why me
jazzy whats next
prince now these girls man you know how it is cant live wit em cant live witout emyou know parents are the same
no matter time nor place
they dont understand that us kids
are going to make some mistakes
so to you all the kids all across the land
theres no need to argue
parents just dont understand
i remember one year
my mom took me school shopping
it was me my brother my mom oh my pop and my little sister
all hopped in the car
we headed downtown to the gallery mall
my mom started bugging with the clothes she chose
i didnt say nothing at first
i just turned up my nose
she said whats wrong this shirt cost $20
i said mom this shirt is plaid with a butterfly collar
the next half hour was the same old thing
my mother buying me clothes from 1963
and then she lost her mind and did the ultimate
i asked her for adidas and she bought me zips
i said mom what are you doing youre ruining my rep
she said youre only sixteen you dont have a rep yet
i said mom lets put these clothes back please
she said no you go to school to learn not for a fashion show
i said this isnt sha na na come on mom im not bowzer
mom please put back the bell-bottom brady bunch trousers
but if you dont want to i can live with that but
you gotta put back the double-knit reversible slacks
she wasnt moved - everything stayed the same
inevitably the first day of school came
i thought i could get over i tried to play sick
but my mom said no no way uh-uh forget it
there was nothing i could do i tried to relax
i got dressed up in those ancient artifacts
and when i walked into school it was just as i thought
the kids were cracking up laughing at the clothes mom bought
and those who werent laughing still had a ball
because they were pointing and whispering
as i walked down the hall
i got home and told my mom how my day went
she said if they were laughing you dont need the
cause theyre not good friends
for the next six hours i tried to explain to my mom
that i was gonna have to go through this about 200 more times
so to you all the kids all across the land
theres no need to argue
parents just dont understand
oh-kay heres the situation
my parents went away on a weeks vacation and
they left the keys to the brand new porsche
would they mind
umm well of course not
ill just take it for a little spin
and maybe show it off to a couple of friends
ill just cruise it around the neighborhood
well maybe i shouldnt
yeah of course i should
pay attention heres the thick of the plot
i pulled up to the corner at the end of my block
thats when i saw this beautiful girlie girl walking
i picked up my car phone to perpetrate like i was talking
you shouldve seen this girls bodily dimensions
i honked my horn just to get her attention
she said was that for me
i said yeah
she said why
i said come on and take a ride with a helluva guy
she said how do i know youre not sick
you could be some deranged lunatic
i said cmon toots - my name is the prince =
beside would a lunatic have a porsche like this
she agreed and we were on our way
she was looking very good and so was i i must say - word
we hit mcdonalds pulled into the drive
we ordered two big macs and two large fries with cokes
she kicked her shoes off onto the floor
she said drive fast speed turns me on
she put her hand on my knee i put my foot on the gas
we almost got whiplash i took off so fast
the sun roof was open  the music was high
and this girls hand was steadily moving up my thigh
she had opened up three buttons on her shirt so far
i guess thats why i didnt notice that police car
were doing ninety in my moms new porsche
and to make this long story short - short
when the cop pulled me over i was scared as hell
i said i dont have a license but i drive very well officer
i almost had a heart attack that day
come to find out the girl was a twelve-year-old runaway
i was arrested the car was impounded
there was no way for me to avoid being grounded
my parents had to come off from vacation to get me
id rather be in jail than to have my father hit me
my parents walked in
i got my grip i said ah mom dad how was your trip
they didnt speak
i said i want to plead my case
but my father just shoved me in the car by my face
that was a hard ride home i dont know how i survived
they took turns -
one would beat me while the other one was driving
i cant believe it i just made a mistake
well parents are the same no matter time nor place
so to you all the kids all across the land
take it from me
parents just dont understandartist dj jazzy jeff &amp; the fresh prince

now i have a story that id like to tell
about this guy you all know he had me scared as hell
he comes to me at night after i crawl into bed
hes burnt up like a weenie and his name is fred
he wears the same hat and sweater every single day
and even if its hot outside he wears it anyway
hes home when im awake but he shows up when i sleep
i cant believe that theres a nightmare on my street

it was a saturday evening if i remember it right
and we had just gotten back off tour last night
so the gang and i thought that it would be groovey
if we summoned up the posse and done rushed the movie
i got angie
jeff got tina
ready rock got some girl id never seen in my life
that was all right because the lady was chill
then we dipped to the theater set to ill
we saw elm street and man it was def
and everything seemed all right when we left
but when i got home and laid down to sleep
that began the nightmare but on my street

it was burning in my room like an oven
my bed soaked with sweat
and man i was bugging
i checked the clock and it stopped at 1230
it had melted it was so darn hot
and i was thirsty
i went downstairs to grab some juice or a coke
flipped the tv off and then i almost choked
when i heard this awful voice coming from behind
it said you got my favorite letter but now you must die
man i aint even wait to see who it was
broke inside my drawers and screamed so long cause
got halfway up the block
i calmed down and stopped screaming
then thought oh i get it i must be dreaming
i strolled back home with a grin on my grill
i think that since this is a dream i might as well get ill
i walked in the house the big bad fresh prince
but freddy killed all that noise real quick
he grabbed me by my neck and said
heres what well do
we gotta lotta work here me and you


the souls of your friends you and i will claim
youve got the body and ive got the brain
i said yo fred
i think you got me all wrong
i aint partners with nobody with nails that long
look ill be honest man this team wont work
the girls wont be on you fred your face is all burnt
i patted him on the shoulder said thanks for stopping by
then i opened up the door and said take care guy
he got mad drew back his arm and slashed my shirt
i laughed at first then thought hold up that hurt
it wasnt a dream man this guy was for real
i said freddy uh pal theres been an awful mistake here
no further words and then i darted upstairs
crashed through my door then jumped on my bed
pulled the covers up over my head
and said oh please do something with fred
he jumped on my bed went through the covers with his claws
tried to get me but my alarm went off
and then silence
it was a whole new day
i thought huh i wasnt scared of him anyway
until i noticed those rips in my sheets
and that was proof that there had been a nightmare on my street

im your dj now princey ha ha ha ha ha ha ha haaaaanow this is the story all about how
my life got flipped turned upside down
and id like to take a minute just sit right there
ill tell you how i became the prince of a town called bel-air

in west philadelphia born and raised
on the playground was where i spent most of my days
chillin out maxin relaxin all cool
and all shootin some b-ball outside of the school
when a couple of guys who were up to no good
started making trouble in my neighborhood
i got in one little fight and my mom got scared
and said youre moving with your auntie and uncle in bel-air

i begged and pleaded with her day after day
but she packed my suitcase and sent me on my way
she gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket
i put my walkman on and said i might as well kick it

first class yo this is bad
drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass
is this what the people of bel-air livin like
hmm 
this might be alright

but wait i hear theyre prissy bourgeois and all that
is this the type of place that they should send this cool cat
i dont think so
ill see when i get there
i hope theyre prepared for the prince of bel-air

well uh
the plane landed and when i came out
there was a dude who looked like a cop standing there with my name out
i aint trying to get arrested yet
i just got here
i sprang with the quickness like lightning disappeared

i whistled for a cab and when it came near
the license plate said fresh and it had dice in the mirror
if anything i can say that this cab was rare
but i thought nah forget it yo holmes to bel-air

i pulled up to the house about 7 or 8
and i yelled to the cabbie yo holmes smell ya later
i looked at my kingdom
i was finally there
to sit on my throne as the prince of bel-airintro/chorus *sung*

summer summer summertime
time to sit back and unwind

verse one fresh prince

here it is the groove slightly transformed
just a bit of a break from the norm
just a little somethin to break the monotony
of all that hardcore dance that has gotten to be
a little bit out of control its cool to dance
but what about the groove that soothes that moves romance
give me a soft subtle mix
and if aint broke then dont try to fix it
and think of the summers of the past
adjust the base and let the alpine blast
pop in my cd and let me run a rhyme
and put your car on cruise and lay back cause this is summertime

chorus

verse two fresh prince

school is out and its a sort of a buzz
but back then i didnt really know what it was
but now i see what have of this
the way that people respond to summer madness
the weather is hot and girls are dressing less
and checking out the fellas to tell em whos best
ridin around in your jeep or your benzos
or in your nissan stting on lorenzos
back in philly we be ou in the park
a place called the plateau is where everybody go
guys out hunting and girls doing likewise
honking at the honey in front of you with the light eyes
she turn around to see what you beeping at
its like the summers a natural afrodesiac
and with a pen and pad i compose this rhyme
to hit you and get you equipped for the summer time

chorus

verse three fresh prince

its late in the day and i aint been on the court yet
hustle to the mall to get me a short set
yeah i got on sneaks but i need a new pair
cause basketball courts in the summer got girls there
the temperatures about 88
hop in the water plug just for old times sake
break to ya crib change your clothes once more
cause youre invited to a barbeque thats starting at 4
sitting with your friends cause yall remincise
about the days growing up and the first person you kissed
and as i think back makes me wonder how 
the smell from a grill could spark up nostalgia
all the kids playing out front
little boys messin round with the girls playing double-dutch
while the djs spinning a tune as the old folks dance at your family reunion
then six oclock rolls around
you just finished wiping your car down
its time to cruise so you go to the summertime hangout
it looks like a car show
everybody come lookin real fine
fresh from the barber shop or fly from the beauty salon
every moment frontin and maxin
chillin in the car they spent all day waxin
leanin to the side but you cant speed through
two miles an hour so everybody sees you
theres an air of love and of happiness
and this is the fresh princes new defintion of summer madness

chorusintro
the maestro
nice flow
hot like nitro
cool as ice though
that type of docodimy
yall know its gotta be
who else could it be but me
rub your eyes but hold the big billy
its dream supreme bean straight from philly
its the eclectic female attractor rapper slash actor
right back at ya
and to the next millenium many come but few are chosen

hypnotizer neuralizer
vivid memories turn to fantasies

from the hospital that first night
took a hour just to get the car-seat in right
people drivin all fast got me kinda upset
got you home safe placed you in your basonette
that night i dont think one wink i slept
as i slipped out my bed to your crib i crept
touched your head gently felt my heart melt
cause i knew i loved you more than life itself
then to my knees and i begged the lord please
let me be a good daddy all he needs
love knowledge discipline too
i pledge my life to you

chorus

verse 3

its a full-time job to be a good dad
you got so much more stuff than i had
i gotta study just to keep with the changin times
101 dalmations on your cd-rom
see me-im
tryin to pretend i know
on my pc where that cd go
but yo aint nuthin promised one day ill be gone
feel the strife but trust life does go on
but just in case
its my place
to impart
one day some girls gonna break your heart
and ooh aint no pain like from the opposite sex
gonna hurt bad but dont take it out on the next son
throughout life people will make you mad
disrespect you and treat you bad
let god deal with the things they do
cause hate in your heart will consume you too
always tell the truth say your prayers
hold doors pull out chairs easy on the swears
youre living proof that dreams come true
i love you and im here for you

boldly mashing totally crashing
words up in a disorderly fashion
but back to the lab &amp; guess what happened kaboom
ooh wee dudes resilient fresh prince was hot
the movies killed him wait hold up stop you can rebuild him

to scenes with sonny so hard to break free from a guaranteed 20
but its done so come see the mc honey

prayin for the day they would one day praise him
studied the ways of the game &amp; made it
came through the maze &amp; the haze &amp; played it perfect
days any person hated &amp; cursed him he was unfazed
he waited it was worth it he never retaliated
he saved it slavin on the road blazin
days when he was low nothin could raise him
he came to the show &amp; somethin uncaged in him
like the pope but its party crusade im like braids thats never gon
fade ya heard
im like 23s on an escalade throw me into the rave
like you threw a grenade - boom

chorus 2x

chorus 2xintro
mic check 1 2 this is dedicated to an old friend of mine michelleshe a holy roller now turned over a new leaf now everythin old gon burn

chorus
ms holy roller new angel got ya bible out shoutin and youre ringing a bell
mid-life reborn cant wait to tell if i dont believe what you believe
im going to hell

ive been down with jesus since sunday school &amp; easter speeches
the bible was survival thats what my grandma would teach us
since i was 5 ive been dying and trying to read it when i did i did it redefined it
now you was 34 when you found jesus after your life fell to pieces
wife two times with two guys now enlightened in speeches
seemed to flow out your mouth with the hype of a preacher
took your whole life to reach you now im a trifling creature

chorus

come on if i die right this second i reckon that god would simply check
into my life &amp; times dissecting my rhymes hell see how ive been leading his troops
you cant do dirt your whole life then say oops

bridge
now where was jesus when you life then you was cheatin when you was deceiving me
where was jesus when you greedy your lawyers was bleeding me
where was jesus when every weekend a new man living with you
oh wait he was with me trying to keep me from killing you
now where was jesus when you was lying &amp; you was betraying me
when i was trying to make it you was hatin delayin me huh
where was jesus when the ice was thrilling you
oh he was he with me trying to keep me from killing you

if i aint know jesus aint no telling where i would be
its been nights i felt like feces; i needed to fight to release it
im in the limelight its hot &amp; the heat is ceaseless
holding my tongue while little bums cut me to pieces
the only reasons cause i studied the life of jesus &amp;
venting with my pen intending to write &amp; release it
but when an ex-friend would slight me or slam me with venom
i hate it i cant stand it damnit i really resent it
i always strive to be righteous my version of god
the reason why i never write verses with curses inside
the reason i never purposely hurt persons
ive applied many teaching of god
searching the reaches of god
pondered the mysteries of why you be dissing me
i adore you all i hope for you is freedom from misery
you made mistakes &amp; blunders you breaking from under
but yo if im going to hell its making me wonder

bridge

the greatest atrocities ever committed on this planet have been in the
name of god
this country was founded by puritans for the expressed purpose of
oppression-free worship
your attitude is the same arrogant fearful fundamentalism that fueled the
hatred of the crusades
&amp; the attacks on 9/11
if we are not allowed to worship god as groups &amp; individuals free from
persecution in respectful
tolerance theres only one outcome

chorusintro

chorus
why should i try to sound like yall sound
thats whats wrong with the rap game right now
man its like a circus wit a bunch of clowns
wit a bunch of clicks ill probably rap circles around

verse 1
i spit heatrock and i aint talking rollin
soon as the beat knock im crowd controlling
when i hear yall that a awful sound
i dont ride beats i take them off the ground
land them somewhere show them the town
even on foreign ground i let them know im around
i dont follow everybody when its time to rap
at one time everybody thought the world was flat
sounds like you that was my intention
i paid dues now dudes pay attention
i live for it even though the flicks is hittin
cribs sick you can see the booth from the kitchen
speak on it cause i saw it happen
this is hip hop dawg
i aint just rappin
yall looking at a real mc
man you couldnt check a mic for me

chorus

why should i try to sound like yall sound
thats whats wrong wit the rap game right now
why should i try to flow the way yall flow
or do a show like yall show
naw that aint where my head at now
yall in the hip hop lost and found
man thats wrong with the rap game right now
its like a circus wit a bunch of clowns
wit a bunch of clicks
ill probably rap circles around

verse 2
lets talk about rhyme capability
lets talk about hip hop versatility
lets talk about taking the game beyond
now how the hell we gon have a battle of wits


trick you aint armed
lets talk about love for the game
i mean real love
back before there was fame
im real wit it
i aint claiming to reign
but when yall talk about rap
yall gon start saying my name
for real though i aint playin
plenty of yall love a brotha just scared to say it
yo the first ever rap grammy
lets talk about the only reason yo ass went to miami
yup truck wit rims check throw back jersey check
champagne bottles check lots of models check
damn thats the list for 90 percent of yall videos and songs
am i wrong

chorus

verse 3
lost
when you a slave to the biz
wit no care for the cost of what you sayin to kids
found
is when ya lyrics are a test of time
and your mom hear that your spirit is blessed divine
lost
is when you rhyme til your throat gets sore
but you dont even believe what you say no more
found
is when you bleed heart into the mic
and the pain you sustain it can change a life
lost
is when you hide behind the freedom of speech
while sure youre free to do it
but what it mean to do it
did you mean to do it
did you need to do it
did you take time to think about the seeds you ruined
found is esco dead prez and them
found is lauren hill
found is rakim
found can be you
if you felt the message and ask yourself this questioin

chorus outintro - why why why why why why

chorus

i really wish i could explain it baby why
its just the world is kinda crazy baby why
aint no pretty way to paint it baby why
dont cry dry your eyes
september 11th i woke up about 7am west coast time french toast and my
turkey bacon taking my time awakin turning my tv on
to my surprise saw what everybody in the world saw
me &amp; my children images were chillin
my son said daddy were there people in that building
a cold sweat frozen with a lump in my chest
i heard his question couldnt bring my lips to say yes to him
that night at my sons side he cried &amp; prayed
for the ones who died in the world trade
his palms to god seeds and qualms with god
he just kept on pressin me wanna know why
then one week later our bombs were dropped
we seein them on cnn they just wont stop
the infrared images of brutal attack
he said daddy now we killin em back; right right

chorus - 2x

bridge - mary j blige
mmmmm souls are captured
dreams are stolen hearts are broken
evil blatantly rewarded
hate surrenders love exalted


hope elated negativity is shorted
why is the bomb always getting the last word
&amp; why did her uncle have to molest her
&amp; why did all them cops have to be shootin to kill
&amp; why did all them priests have to act so ill
tell me why did james byrd jr have to be touched
tell me why did malcolm &amp; martin depart from us
tell me why did that sniper make the little boy shoot
&amp; why is human life always denied for loot
tell me why did mandela have to live in a cage
why did my brother sterling have to die at that age
tell me why did reginald denny deserve his fate
&amp; why the f*@k cant love seem to defeat hate
tell me why is it so hard for all the children to eat
why did pac &amp; biggie smalls have to fall in the street
tell me why did jam master jay have to go that way
please what am i supposed to say to my kids when they say why

chorus - 2x

verse 3
cant explain it baby life is just really crazy
i mean if its world wars or the life of a little baby
we got more stores than they got rice under buddha lazy
you live four scores &amp; still it be driving you crazy
but for me i try to see the bright side
sometimes itd be like the goodness be tryin to hide
then try to flee but it cant its deep inside
sweetie you be the light for the others make em believe in god

bridge - mary j bligeyo aint no better man for this hype track
just the veteran taking the mic back
david letterman even said he like that track man
even though he aint a rap fan
black radio they wont play though
ever since summertime they aint liked none of mine
even though the fans went out &amp; bought enough
i guess they think will aint hard enough
maybe i should just have a shoot out
run up in the bank bust grabbin all the loot out
whoop somebody ass taking my boot out

the essence of stimulation mental man
but if your acting like you just got out the kennel man
put your foot on the pedal &amp; pump

now this is where the pumpin of the brakes should start
girlfriend thinks that somethings going on
girl tells girlfriend nothings going on
boys in the middle of the commotion beginning
girlfriends mad cause boy keeps grinning

girlfriend should chill before they roll up in the joint
jumping to conclusions gets you no where honey

chorusyo big will in the place to be mic checkmic check
would you love me in the shack in a shanty town
would you love me if my pants was hand me downs huh
yo yo
often times i hear a phrase when im out &amp; about
8 to 80 all walks of life be shouting it out
usually when its time for a encore i hear it
or when i did something hot evoking the spirit
its weird its like a double edge sword when yall applaud
its kinda wild a peace sign a smile
how do i respond to the phrase i love you will
kinda heavy when i hear it id be like damn for real
in a way it makes me wanna stay strong and moral
but history say i could be gone tomorrow
&amp; though my future looks floral
i feel like im hoping for much pain
when people stop shouting my name
&amp; doubting my game &amp; liking others better than me
writing letters to him instead of to me
a veteran b i know the game but do me this here
in your heart be clear before you bless my ear
come on

chorus

could you love me if i lived in a shanty town
could you love me if my pants was hanging down
could you love me if my wrist aint bling
if i wasnt on tv &amp; i aint sing huh
could you love me if my whip wasnt chrome fitted
would my name be easier to forget it huh
could you love me if wrist aint bling
if i wasnt on tv &amp; i aint sing huh
i pray before i sit with a pen &amp; a pad
a birth of a thought occurs &amp; it calls me dad
to the universe an idea released from me
just a cd nah man a piece of me
what you cant see is when you be dancing b
is i asked you a question thats how you answer me
so when you dont dance it be like im choking from cancer
like i wrote rancid rhymes i cant survive
sure i rationalize like oh i see
but if you dont like my cut its like you dont like me
some stuff works some works not so well
its like you work so hard still get hurt like hell
yo it could tear you apart
but dont let your wins go to your heard
your losses go to your heart
&amp; if we ever get the pleasure to meet
be clever with it measure what you yell in the street
come on

chorus

whoo would you
whoo could you

chorusthis is a true story

chorus

loretta wrote a love letter to a stranger thought that he would change her life
thought she would be his wife oh loretta

thought that he would change her life
miss loretta a young girl i never really met her
a fun girl a real go-getter i heard a gold jetta
a full with books &amp; herb or so im told hooked on my every word
oh so bold a love letter cleverly worded in a jacket pocket
wrapped inside a platinum locket
in the shape of a heart with pictures of me

she fell in love with the prince of bel-air
fantasy was to see me &amp; to be with me there
so she wrote a love letter to me &amp; then she signed it loretta
said i gotta go get him will is my soulmate
we gotta be together how could we not be together
but wait if i send the letter i mean how will i be sure if they give it to him
what if they dont give it to him that would ruin everything
i gotta take it to him myself

chorus

she packed all that she owned into the back of her jetta
her backpack her cellphone &amp; a love letter
most of her stuff was done up with pictures of me on it with a phrase its gonna be on it
her mother begging her please come home &amp; then loretta resenting her
leave me alone ma i wont leave my destiny unfulfilled
youre just jealous be cause daddy aint as sweet as my willclick
to the front gate at nbc in june &amp; july backstage at mtv

chorusfrom a distance you can witness the glow from my entourage
gravitate towards the ambiance
see me &amp; my men on cnn then the birth of the inevitable hate begin
cause hate is the chld to greatness
the glue between neo &amp; the smiths in the matrix yin to the yang
it just must be ask anybody with a grammy or an mvp

verse 1
oh ok
once upon a time there was a kid who wanted nothin more than to rhyme
almost like he was born in the rhyme
he thought of his rhymes almost all of the time
and he fought with his mom
his school getting caught with his rhyme book
and he knew he shouldnt of took it there in the first place
at least he shouldnt of been sittin lookin there in her face with it
teacher told him get it out of her class
wicked witch trick told him thats probably why you wont pass
now if you shy you wont last but youre new
so underneath his breath before he left he said im a be richer then you
what you say she said
what you mean he said
boy dont you play she said
what you mean he said damnit
ten minutes later standin up in the principles office
getting handed the phone clammed up cause his father was talking
and he was pissed he wasnt listening to his son
you testing me you messin up again
you done boy
chorus
this is just a story about a young man comin up in the rap game
a real scary story
went from rags to riches it has goblins in it haters and witches uh

repeat chorus

verse 2
first thing he did was find somebody to give him some money
he wasnt stupid but wasnt using his senses honey
the guys he meant was a little shady a little funny
but they gave him the money so they played the record company
it sounds silly but when he grew up in philly rhymin wasnt what it is today
deals wasnt a dime a dozen
today every sister uncle or mom or cousin gotta record deal
but for real it wasnt like that then
as you could imagine when he started risin to fame and fortune he was
havin started antagonizing the guys he was with
at the same time he started realizing
the deal he got from them guys in his eyes didnt fly with size of his hits
he called a meeting to find a solution
he said im gettin beat out of my loot
and im not recording no more until we find a solution
the dudes said we found a solution its this 44
he ran for the door a little shaken
but the next day he found a lawyer told him the situation
he said im breakin this contract for ya
he said how much the lawyer said im a charge you a quarter cause i like you 
just do me a favor
get your life in order
