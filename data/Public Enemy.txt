in this corner with the 98
subject of suckers object of hate

driving by waving my fist
making em mad when im going like this
top gun never on the run
they know not to come cause they all get some
going quicker in the speeding lane
jealous cant do it and its causing them pain
caught in my smoke all they did was choke
look at my spokes you know im no joke
out that window middle finger for all
jealous at my ride stereo and blackwalls
suckers they got the nerve and gall
to talk about the car when theyre walking tall

suckers to the side i know you hate my 98

suckers to the side i know you hate my 98

[chuck d]
pulling away every day
leaving you in the dust so you know i get paid
on the mile ego trip and 5-0 tailing on my tip
watch me burn rubber fall in my flame
this episode is always the same
seeing no comp coming like im blind
all left back trailing my behind
i go faster cops try to shoot me
theyll get theirs when they try to get me
ill let it go my turbo
run em in the river cause theyre moving too slow
laughing hard at their attempt
so what if the judge charges me contempt
ill rub my boomerang cause im feeling proud
and i wouldnt even hear em cause my radios loud

suckers to the side i know you hate my 98
youre gonna get yours 
suckers to the side i know you hate my 98
youre gonna get yours

[chuck d]
cruising down the boulevard
im treated like some superstar
you know the time so dont look hard
get with it the ultimate homeboy car
all you suckers in the other rides
wherever im coming get to my side
my 98 is tough to chase
if youre on my tail better watch your face
smoke is coming when i burn
rubber when my wheels turn
tinted windows so super bad
looking like the car the green hornet had
its the reason im ahead of the pack
its the reason i left them back
its the reason all the people say
my 98 olds blows em all away

my 98 oldsmobile is su-su-su
my 98 oldsmobiles so su-su-su
my 98 oldsmobile is su-su-su

suckers to the side i know you hate my 98

[chuck d]
understand i dont drive drunk
my 98s fly i dont drive no junk
no cop got a right to call me a punk
take this ticket go to hell and stick it
put me on a kick but line up times up
this government needs a tune up
i dont even know whats happening whats up
gun in my chest im under arrest
sidewalk suckers wanted to spill me
so i got my crew and posse
took the girls and got them to thrill me
stepped outside got in my ride
drove them around and i looked around town
caught em out there cold ran em over and down
they didnt get me and thats the truth
cause my 98-o is bullet proof

my 98 oldsmobiles so su-su-su
my 98 oldsmobile is su-su-su
my 98 oldsmobiles so su-su-su
my 98 oldsmobiles like super spormthat woman in the corner cold playin the role
just leave her ass in the corner till her feet get cold
knowin for a fact that girl is whacked
if you hold your hand out shell turn her back
better walk dont talk shes all pretend
cant be her friend unless you spend
wall to wall after all
get ready to throw only money at the bitch

cause she thinks shes so-
phisticated

peekin seekin inside a book
her demands for a man with a chemical look
wishes desires gettin worse with age
she doesnt want a man all she wants is a page
aint got a man so she goes to a club
she think its classy but its really a pub
but thats the kind of place she likes to go
the bitch got a problem

cause she thinks shes so-
phisticated

jackets shoes everyday ties
the girl only wants one of those guys
suckers who front like it aint no thing
pretend to be friends dont want that thang
talk like this dont talk slang
do anything to get that thang
tries to be chic and play it off
peekin through the window i saw her take her clothes off
nasty girl stone cold freak
stayin in bed a whole goddamn week
comin and leavin guys servin up storms
from execs with checks boys from the dorms
never kept a name never seen a face
she could pass em in the street like it never took place
i know shes a ho im on the go
expose the funky bitch

cause she thinks shes so-
phisticated

now she wants a sucker but with an attache
and if you aint got it shell turn you away
you can smile with stile but you lost your trial
cause you got a gold tooth she thinks youre wild
she dont want a brother thats true and black
if youre light youre alright better you stay back
cause the sucker with the bag is out the catch
with something in his bag keepin her attached
the mans got a plan its ibm
the devil at her level yes its him
his audi she rides his gold and clothes
the ill base method turning up her nose
lack a lack a lack now beaming her up
she still got the nerve to turn her funky nose up
her status looks at us from down below
now the bitch is in trouble

cause she was so-
phisticated

little is known about her past
so listen to me cause i know her ass
used to steal money out her boyfriends clothes
and never got caught so the story goes
she kept doin that to all her men
found the wrong man when she did it again
and still to this day people wonder why
he didnt beat the bitch down till she almost died

so-
phisticated[intro]
yo chuck run a power move on them

[yeeaahh]

[verse 1 - chuck d]
step back get away - give the brother some room
you got to all turn me up when the beat goes boom
lyric to lyric - line to line
then you yall understand my reputation for rhyme
cause my rhyme reputation depends on what
style of record my dj cuts
his slice an dice - super mix so nice
so bad you wont dispute the price
cause its plain to see - its a strain to be
number one in the public eye enemy
cause im wanted in 50 - almost 51
states where the posse got me on the run
its a big wonder why i havent gone under
dodgin all types of microphone thunder
a fugitive missin all types of hell
all this because i talk so well
when i

rock - get up - get down
miuzi weighs a ton
hold it 

[verse 2 - chuck d]
the match up title - the expression of thrill
for elite to compete and attempt to get ill
if looks could kill - id chill until
all the public catches on to my material - you know
the ducks criticize my every phase of rapture
cant wait to read the headlines of my capture
accused of assault - a 1st degree crime
cause i beat competitors with my rhyme
tongue whipped pushed shoved and tripped
choked from the hold of my kung fu grip
and if you want my title - it would be suicidal
from my end - it would be homicidal
when i do work - you get destroyed
all the paranoid - know to avoid
the public enemy seat ive enjoyed
this is no kid and im not no toy boy

rock - get up - get down
miuzi weighs a ton
hold it

[verse 3 - chuck d]
im a public enemy but i dont rob banks
i dont shoot bullets and i dont shoot blanks
my style is supreme - number one is my rank
and i got more power than the new york yanks
if miuzi wasnt heavy id probably fire it
id make you walk the plank if i was a pirate
if they made me a king - i would be a tyrant
if you want to get me - go ahead and try it
snatcher dispatcher biter never been a
instead of takin me out - take a girl to dinner
the level of comp has never been thinner
its a runaway race where im the winner
its unreal - they call the law
and claimed i had started a war
it was war they wanted and war they got
but they wilted in the heat when miuzi got hot

rock - get up - get down
miuzi weighs a ton
hold it

[verse 4 - chuck d]
my style versatile said without rhymes
which is why theyre after me an on my back
lookin over my shoulder - seein what i write
hearin what i say - then wonderin why
why they cant ever compete on my level
superstar status is my domain
understand my rhythm - my pattern of lecture
and then youll know why im on the run
this change of events results in a switch
its the lateral movement of my vocal pitch
it eliminates pressure on the haunted
but the posse is around so i got to front it
plus employ tactics so coy
and leave no choice but to destroy
soloists groups and what they say
and all that try to cross my way
when i


rock - get up - get down
miuzi weighs a ton
hold it

[outro]
yeah thats right
public enemy number one in new york
public enemy number one in philly
public enemy number one in dc
public enemy number one in cleveland ohio
also where public enemy number one in st louis
public enemy number one in new jersey
and bust it
where also public enemy number one in cincinnati
in atlanta[intro - flavor flav]
hey chuck we got some non-believers out there…
yo we got to do somethin about that man…
yo we got to get stupid
yo we gotta let ‘em know what time it is

[verse 1 - chuck d]
you go ooh and ahh when i jump in my car
people treat me like kareem abdul jabbar
no matter who you are when im up to par
i betcha go hip hop hurray or hurrah
but the ahhs and ohhs is my kind of news
pop your tape in put your car in cruise
i never heard the boos i never drank booze
cause i just rock the rhythm left alone the blues
the li mystique you sneak to peek
a look and then you know that were never weak
i know you cant wait its never too late
no fear im here and everything is straight
cycles cycles life runs in cycles
new is old no im not no psycho
the monkey on the back makes the best excel
the people in the crowd makes the rock well
the people in the back lets you know whos whack
and those who lack the odds are stacked
the one who makes the money is white not black
you might not believe it but its like that
when you come to my show watch me throw
down with the other brothers toe to toe
when you make a move new not used
and watch the bro here just bust a groove
a fat lady soprano loads my ammo
and hear my jam with a funky piano
easy on the wall but hard on the panel
a fool smokes kools cause he chokes on camels
in effect the crews in check
run by the posse with the gold around the neck
homeboys in heat lookin for sweet
ladies in the crowd so they can meet
somebody to body makin a baby
givin it to grandma then makin her crazy
im a mc protector us defector
south african government wrecker
panther power you can feel it in my arm
lookout yall cause im a timebomb
tickin tockin all about rockin
makin much dollars while the crazy ones clockin
the rhythm to shake the house downy down
bounce to the ounce sound so crown
the man the enemy public king no
all fall to the force of my swing
like ali frazier thriller in manila
a pinpoint point blank microphone killer am i
no need to lie got the flavor flav

to prove ill win and if not the save
ill pick up rack up - put your whole shack up
just choose to lose the bet emcee stick up
this is the wiz but the mikes not his its mine
one time let the star shine
and im tellin you yelling at you youre through
dont think youre grown because your moustache grew
im number one you know it weighs a ton
and ill be the burger you can be the bun girl
surroundin my steady poundin
get get on down to my funky sound
and rock the rhythm rhyme one time your mind
rhythm roll two times control
the mauler and the caller of your doom
and when im ready to leave youre gonna know i go boom
three times yall rhythm rhyme and rock
then youll that the d is on the block
four times yall and never ever the whack
its the hour to the minute time to blow black[intro - flavor flav]

what do you got to say about this
a force so strong that you cant resist
you may as well joinem you know you cant beatem
pack a hundred people ya know ya gonna needem
straight with the system is down by law
cause every half hour they get nine more
they run all dollars that come in town
either join the crew or get beat down
i watched all the guys be so damn cruel
try to get fast you must be a fool
blood through and through the boys dont play
i seenem tax and run an operation today
they had too too too much posse

yeah i had a party much people came by
im talking to a g cause the g real fly
chillin’ in my room chewin off her ear
chillin stupid fly cause i got stupid gear
my door kicked open by her man and crew
the g turned turned to me and said who you
so i said yo fly yeah the g lied
stuck in the corner while the g cried
and then from the back my homeboys came
their uzis and nines and said “don’t blame”
ya lying ass girl with the fake tears
we got a big posse and we show no fears
we got too too too much posse
we got too too too much posse[intro flavor flav]

a time for a crime that i cant find
ill show you my gun my uzi weighs a ton

[verse 2 chuck d]
you got no rap but you want to battle

i dont break in stores but i break all laws
written while sitting all bidding not hidden
giving me the juice that youre not getting
im not a law obeyer so you can tell your mayor
imma non-stop rhythm rock poetry sayer
im the rhyme player the ozone layer
a battle what heres a bible so start your prayer
this word to the wise is justified
if they ask you what happened just admit you lied
you just got caught up for going out of order
and now youre serving football teams their water
you messed with the master word to chuck
and i waxed cold taxed make sure you got dunked
you just got dissed all but dismissed
sucker duck emcees you get me pissed
its no fun being on the run
because they got me public enemy number one

one one one one

they said stop freeze i got froze up
because im public enemy number one

one one one one

[verse 4 chuck d]

and still gettin fly with the mike in my hand
im cold coolin out layin in the shade
dealers buggin cause theyre gonna get sprayed
their intimidator your scarface
whats goin on huh whats takin place
i dont wear gold but i clock ducats
and i have the money overflowing out of buckets
you want crazy dollars i make people holler
you stick em stupid and im snatching biters collars

ill rebuilt the mine to alleviate
unnecessary pressures that can create
the sting that stung yama-goochie foo yung
when he bit the public enemy he only got hung
cause his brain was gettin bigger than a pregnant toad
his heartbeat stopped cause of overload
i made the beat that broke his back
i cut his circulation made his world turn back
i find out things like esp
amazing world of kreskins brain velocity
like alexander mundy im in like flint
mercedes limousine with a hardcore tint
im captain of the ship i make em walk the planks
riding round the world hundred sixty million francs
not like the kind that you put on the grill
cause i only do it like that when im on a chill hill
when i get to the beach the grounds so sandy
girls on my jock like ants on candy
checking out the fellas with the girls on the side
put ya boat in the water lets take a ride
to the land of party people rocking shocking to the beat
so keep ya eyes on ya girl cause ya know im gonna cheat
im gonna max and relax and chill my will
body rockin brain shockin makes your heart stand still

im goin for the money that man ever made
gettin thrill from orders suckers obeyed
its gettin late and i cant wait
to drive by the bus and rock my tape
my car is movin fast like a train
never skid off the road even in the rain
cold dodgin tickets rockin all the jams
make biters step back and understand[verse 1]
i am taking no prisoners taking no shorts
breakin with the metal of a couple of forts
while were hearin that boom supplement the mix
were gonna rush em like the bears in the 46
homeboys i dont know but theyre part of the pack
in the plan against the man bum rush attack
for the suckers at the door if youre up and around
for the suckers at the door were gonna knock you back down

yo bum rush the show

[verse 2]
searching my body for fuckin what
cause my guns just for fun and knife dont cut
how can i make you understand
i get ill on a posse with my goddamn hands
troubles not me i dont mean to cause
but you took one look and began to pause
didnt holler at the dollar we willin to spend
but you took one look and wouldnt let our ass in

yo bum rush the show

[verse 3]
cold bum rushin doors like at first its something
but all we realize that the show aint nothin
for the stunts and the blunts whole world inside
the reason that the mighty used force supplied
no comp well stomp all in our way
gave me static so i wont pay
it might be a trick that you dont like
comin in the side door then grabbin the mike

walkin and talkin - fist full in the air
it might seem like that we dont care
a ho for an oh a pow for an ow
girls start screamin all i say is wow
get that sucker who shot that gun
whip his monkey ass till it aint no fun
5-o showed and wouldnt you know
they blamed it on the kid cause all i said was

yo bum rush the showraise your hands so we can
raise the roof so you can
raise your voice so we can
raise the roof

raise the roof because its all on fire
not done by the sun or electrical wire
not done by sons stricking matches with daughters
but done by scratches so save that water
this jam is packed so i just figure
all we need is the house to get bigger
so startin with the roof down to the base
were at your service to burn the place

come on
come on raise the roof
come on
raise the roof
come on

with the spot as hot as it can get
the roofs on fire youre soaked and wet
the puzzle on your face shows as you sweat
but your body keeps movin with no regrets
chandeliers shake swing from front to back
left to right all night and the lights dont crack
your minds on the time hopin it dont end
its time to get stupid here we go again

come on
come on raise the roof
come on
raise the roof
come on

stare at the strope pull your earlobe
for the sights and sounds clear across the globe
this jam might hit or miss the charts
but the style gets wild as state of the art
dazzling in science bold in nerve
but givin my house what it deserves
served on the floor cause i got played
make the fans that left wished they hada stayed
realize my friend aint this a trip
as your body gets railed when you do the flip
and your mind gets rocked when were on a roll
then the freak of the week makes you loose control
a swatch for a watch so youll know the time
your crowd gets loud and you clock my rhyme
the messiahs on fire and im living proof
ill quench your desire and raise your roof

come on
come on raise the roof
come on
raise the roof
come on

in school im cool throughout the week
when the weekend comes im down with the greeks
frat brothers known across the seven seas
fly ladies of the 80s sororities
zetas deltas akas
women that keep me in a daze
phi sigma boys in the move
with the kappas and the ques and of course the grooves too
and for real its the deal and the actual fact
takes a nation of millions to hold me back
rejected and accepted as a communist
claimin fame to my name as a terrorist
makin money in corners that youll never see
dodgin judges and the lawyers and the third degree
nothin wrong with a song to make the strong survive
realize gave me five cause i kept em alive
mislead what you read bout my devilish deeds
mislead what i said so youre better off dead
make em hear it and see it for the def and blind
and command it and well plan it for incapable minds
take for granted and demand it from the wave of my hand
make the jealous understand it just say damn
when they see me ask a question how the hell can it be
when they watch me pull a serpent straight out of the sea
turn the winter into summer then from hot to cold
expand my power on the hour make you all behold
from the slammer swing a hammer like the mighty thor
god of thunder youll go under then youll all applaud
and fathom that distance that the mad must reap
meet namor sea lord prince of the deep
here for you to fear at any cost
tellin you to get busy or you better get lost
livin lives civilized from the lessons i taught
cities buried underground just because i went off
my friends enemies better be my friend
is the question people guessin is this the end

end of the world are you guessin yes
just say dont delay it get it off your chest
houses of crack ive seen too much
i go ready aim fire then ill blow em uptime is gettin crazy people clockin out
theyre robbin all the cribs on a death wish route
breakin into cars trying to steal their system
20 pounds on the bar betcha cant lift em
ya throw two punches now you got no wind
hittin mega pipes gettin super stupid thin
crying all the tears smokin all the squares
workin for ya boy ya came short and full of swears
ya couldnt make the money cause ya smoked up the product
walkin round the town skeptalepsy illaroduct
cant be trusted cause youre living in the past
ya should have kept yo ass away from that blast

oh please oh please oh please oh please
just give me just one more hit
megablast

i got a homeboy who is out on the block
he sells mo crack that they sell fish at the dock
he runs to every car thinkin hes a star
he gets his product snatched by some people in a car
the car pulls off he hung onto the side
of the car that is in motion guess his product took a ride
he tried to sell a dime for a thirty dollar bill
fake gold plate on the back no frill
fake hawaiian suit scratched up knees
in his fridgerator bread water cheese
antique fork how long will it last
well see in twelve minutes when he wants the blast

poison attack - the black word bond
daddy-o
once said to me
he knew a brother who stayed all day in his jeep
and at night he went to sleep
and in the mornin all he had was
the sneakers on his feet
the culprit used to jam and rock the mike yo
he stripped the jeep to fill his pipe
and wander around to find a place
where they rocked to a different kind ofbassi got a letter from the government
the other day
i opened and read it
it said they were suckers
they wanted me for their army or whatever
picture me given a damn - i said never
here is a land that never gave a damn
about a brother like me and myself
because they never did
i wasnt wit it but just that very minute
it occured to me
the suckers had authority
cold sweatin as i dwell in my cell
how long has it been
they got me sittin in the state pen
i gotta get out - but that thought was thought before
i contemplated a plan on the cell floor
im not a fugitive on the run
but a brother like me begun - to be another one
public enemy servin time - they drew the line yall
to criticize me some crime - never the less
they could not understand that im a black man
and i could never be a veteran
on the strength the situations unreal
i got a raw deal so im goin for the steel

they got me rottin in the time that im servin
tellin you what happened the same time theyre throwin
4 of us packed in a cell like slaves - oh well
the same motherfucker got us livin is his hell
you have to realize - what its a form of slavery
organized under a swarm of devils
straight up - wordem up on the level
the reasons are several most of them federal
here is my plan anyway and i say
i got gusto but only some i can trust - yo
some do a bid from 1 to 10
and i never did and plus i never been
im on a tier where no tears should ever fall
cell block and locked - i never clock it yall
cause time and time again time
they got me servin to those and to them
im not a citizen
but ever when i catch a c-o
sleepin on the job - my plan is on go-ahead
on the strength ima tell you the deal
i got nothin to lose
cause im goin for the steel

you know i caught a c-o
fallin asleep on death row
i grabbed his gun - then he did what i said so
and everymans got served
along with the time they served
decency was deserved
to understand my demands
i gave a warnin - i wanted the governor yall
and plus the warden to know
that i was innocent -
because im militant
posing a threat you bet its fuckin up the government
my plan said i had to get out and break north
just like with olivers neck
i had to get off - my boys had the feds in check
they couldnt do nuthin
we had a force to instigate a prison riot
this is what it takes for peace
so i just took the piece
black for black inside time to cut the leash
freedom to get out - to the ghetto - no sell out
6 c-os we got we ought to put their head out
but ill give em a chance cause im civilized
as for the rest of the world they cant realize
a cell is hell - im a rebel so i rebel
between bars got me thinkin like an animal
got a woman c-o to call me a copter
she tried to get away and i popped her
twice right
now who wanna get nice
i had 6 c-os now its 5 to go
and im serious - call me delirious
but im still a captive
i gotta rap this
time to break as time grows intense
i got the steel in my right hand
now im lookin for the fence

i ventured into the courtyard
followed by 52 brothers
bruised battered and scarred but hard
goin out with a bang
ready to bang out
but power from the sky
and from the tower shots rang out
a high number of dose - yes
and some came close
figure i trigger my steel
stand and hold my post
this is what i mean - an anti-nigger machine
if i come out alive and then they wont - come clean
and then i threw up my steel bullets - flew up
blew up who shot
what who the bazooka was who
and to my rescue it was the s1ws
secured my getaway so i just gotaway
the joint broke from the black smoke
then they saw it was rougher thatn the average bluffer
cause the steel was black the attitude exact
now the chase is on tellin you to cmon
53 brothers on the run and we are gonebrothers and sisters brothers and sisters 
i dont know what this world is coming to

yes - the rhythm the rebel
without a pause - im lowering my level
the hard rhymer - where you never been im in
you want stylin - you know its time again
d the enemy - tellin you to hear it
they praised the music - this time they play the lyrics
some say no to the album the show
bum rush the sound i made a year ago
i guess you know - you guess im just a radical
not a sabbatical - yes to make it critical
the only part your body should be parting to
panther power on the hour from the rebel to you

radio - suckers never play me
on the mix - just ok me
now known and grown when theyre clocking my zone its known
snakin and takin everything that a brother owns
hard - my calling card
recorded and orderd - supporter of chesimard
loud and proud kickin live next poet supreme
loop a troop bazooka the scheme
flavor - a rebel in his own mind
supporter of my rhyme
designed to scatter a line of suckers who claim i do crime

terminator x

to those that disagree it causes static
for the original black asiatic man
cream of the earth
and was here first
and some devils prevent this from being known
but you check out the books they own
even masons they know it
but refuse to show it yo

passin it on
poison attack - the black word bond
daddy-o
once said to me
he knew a brother who stayed all day in his jeep
and at night he went to sleep
and in the mornin all he had was
the sneakers on his feet
the culprit used to jam and rock the mike yo
he stripped the jeep to fill his pipe
and wander around to find a place
where they rocked to a different kind ofbassi got a letter from the government
the other day
i opened and read it
it said they were suckers
they wanted me for their army or whatever
picture me given a damn - i said never
here is a land that never gave a damn
about a brother like me and myself
because they never did
i wasnt wit it but just that very minute
it occured to me
the suckers had authority
cold sweatin as i dwell in my cell
how long has it been
they got me sittin in the state pen
i gotta get out - but that thought was thought before
i contemplated a plan on the cell floor
im not a fugitive on the run
but a brother like me begun - to be another one
public enemy servin time - they drew the line yall
to criticize me some crime - never the less
they could not understand that im a black man
and i could never be a veteran
on the strength the situations unreal
i got a raw deal so im goin for the steel

they got me rottin in the time that im servin
tellin you what happened the same time theyre throwin
4 of us packed in a cell like slaves - oh well
the same motherfucker got us livin is his hell
you have to realize - what its a form of slavery
organized under a swarm of devils
straight up - wordem up on the level
the reasons are several most of them federal
here is my plan anyway and i say
i got gusto but only some i can trust - yo
some do a bid from 1 to 10
and i never did and plus i never been
im on a tier where no tears should ever fall
cell block and locked - i never clock it yall
cause time and time again time
they got me servin to those and to them
im not a citizen
but ever when i catch a c-o
sleepin on the job - my plan is on go-ahead
on the strength ima tell you the deal
i got nothin to lose
cause im goin for the steel

you know i caught a c-o
fallin asleep on death row
i grabbed his gun - then he did what i said so
and everymans got served
along with the time they served
decency was deserved
to understand my demands
i gave a warnin - i wanted the governor yall
and plus the warden to know
that i was innocent -
because im militant
posing a threat you bet its fuckin up the government
my plan said i had to get out and break north
just like with olivers neck
i had to get off - my boys had the feds in check
they couldnt do nuthin
we had a force to instigate a prison riot
this is what it takes for peace
so i just took the piece
black for black inside time to cut the leash
freedom to get out - to the ghetto - no sell out
6 c-os we got we ought to put their head out
but ill give em a chance cause im civilized
as for the rest of the world they cant realize
a cell is hell - im a rebel so i rebel
between bars got me thinkin like an animal
got a woman c-o to call me a copter
she tried to get away and i popped her
twice right
now who wanna get nice
i had 6 c-os now its 5 to go
and im serious - call me delirious
but im still a captive
i gotta rap this
time to break as time grows intense
i got the steel in my right hand
now im lookin for the fence

i ventured into the courtyard
followed by 52 brothers
bruised battered and scarred but hard
goin out with a bang
ready to bang out
but power from the sky
and from the tower shots rang out
a high number of dose - yes
and some came close
figure i trigger my steel
stand and hold my post
this is what i mean - an anti-nigger machine
if i come out alive and then they wont - come clean
and then i threw up my steel bullets - flew up
blew up who shot
what who the bazooka was who
and to my rescue it was the s1ws
secured my getaway so i just gotaway
the joint broke from the black smoke
then they saw it was rougher thatn the average bluffer
cause the steel was black the attitude exact
now the chase is on tellin you to cmon
53 brothers on the run and we are gonebrothers and sisters brothers and sisters 
i dont know what this world is coming to

yes - the rhythm the rebel
without a pause - im lowering my level
the hard rhymer - where you never been im in
you want stylin - you know its time again
d the enemy - tellin you to hear it
they praised the music - this time they play the lyrics
some say no to the album the show
bum rush the sound i made a year ago
i guess you know - you guess im just a radical
not a sabbatical - yes to make it critical
the only part your body should be parting to
panther power on the hour from the rebel to you

radio - suckers never play me
on the mix - just ok me
now known and grown when theyre clocking my zone its known
snakin and takin everything that a brother owns
hard - my calling card
recorded and orderd - supporter of chesimard
loud and proud kickin live next poet supreme
loop a troop bazooka the scheme
flavor - a rebel in his own mind
supporter of my rhyme
designed to scatter a line of suckers who claim i do crime

terminator x

then slapped the macintosh

x on the flex hit me now
i dont know about later
as for now i know how to avoid the paranoid
man ive had it up to here
gear i wear got em goin in fear
rhetoric said
read just a bit ago
not quittin though
signed the hard rhymer
work to keep from gettin jerked
changin some ways
to way back in the better days
raw metaphysically bold
never followed a code
still dropped a load
never question what i am god knows
cause its comin from the heart
what i got better get some
get on up hustler of culture
snakebitten
been spit in the face
but the rhymes keep fittin
respects been givin hows ya livin
now i cant protect a pad off defect
check the record
an reckon an intentional wreck
played off as some intellect
made the call took the fall
broke the laws
not my fault theyre fallin off
known as fair square
throughout my years
so i growl at the livin foul
black to the bone my home is your home
so welcome to the terrordome
subordinate terror
kickin off an era
cold deliverin pain
my 98 was 87 on a record yo
so now i go bronco

crucifixion aint no fiction
so called chosen frozen
apology made to who ever pleases
still they got me like jesus
i rather sing bring think reminisce
bout a brother while im in sync
every brother aint a brother cause a color
just as well could be undercover
backstabbed grabbed a flag
from the back of the lab
told a rab get off the rag
sad to say i got sold down the river
still some quiver when i deliver
never to say i never know or had a clue
word was heard plus hard on the boulevard
lies scandalizin basin
traits of hate whos celebratin wit satan
i rope a dope the evil with righteous
bobbin and weavin and let the good get even
cmon down
and welcome to the terrordome
caught in the race against time
the pit and the pendulum
check the rhythm and rhymes
while im bendin em
snakes blowin up the lines of design
tryin to blind the science im snedin em
how to fight the power
cannot run and hide
but it shouldnt be suicide
in a game a fool without the rules
got a hell of a nerve to just criticize
every brother aint a brother
cause a black hand
squeezed on malcom x the man
the shootin of huey newton
from a hand of a nigger who pulled the trigger

its weak to speak and blame somebody else
when you destroy yourself
first nothings worse than a mothers pain
of a son slain in bensonhurst
cant wait for the state to decide the fate
so this jam i dedicate
places with racist faces
just an example of one of many cases
the greek weekend speech i speak
from a lesson learned in virginia beach
i dont smile in the line of fire
i go wildin
but its on bass and drums even violins
watcha do gitcha head ready
instead of gettin physically sweaty
when i get mad
i put it down on a pad
give ya somethin that cha never had controllin
fear of high rollin
god bless your soul and keep livin
never allowed kickin it loud
droppin a bomb
brain game intellectual vietnam
move as a team
never move alone
but
welcome to the terrordomeman to man
i dont know if they can
from what i know
the parts dont fit
ahh shit
how hes sharin a needle
with a drug addict
he dont believe he has it
either
but now he does he doesnt know cause he
goes straight to a ho

but the bag poppedshe wants a lover right now
but not no brother
her man gotta have a lotta money
to get under her cover
now shes a fine sister
but up here shes missin it
she says she wanna learn about life
no old black bull shit
at the age of 15 a brother gave her a baby
shes 19 now and it drover her crazy
and now everytime
she turns around
all the people in the neighborhood
look and get mand and sing

chorus

meet mr succesful
i guess hes blessed yeah
but he happens to be a brother
who only wants blue eyes and blonde hair
now this young mister
he dont like sisters
he couldnt find that special one
he know why he missed her
he says sisters wasnt good enuff
they only wanted his green stuff
thats why everytime he turned
around all the people
in the neighborhood
looked and got mad
and sang

chorus

i try to tell my people
there should not be any hatred
for a brother or a sister
whose opposite race theyve mated
no man is god
and god put us all here yeah
but this system has no wisdom
the devil split us in pairs
and taught us white is good black is bad
and black and white is still too bad
thats why everytime i turn around
all the people in my neighborhood
look mad and sing

choruswhen im talkin rhyme time
to blow your mind time some say
its nothing worse than a verse
to hear some nigger curse
they call me rude some dudes fiery attitude
claimin i boast and smoke
and sometimes sing the blues
i twang metal and settle
try to never back pedal
from the power some got
to get a nigger shot
the null and void i avoid
i test the paranoid
never had to be bad
my mama raised me mad
so what i got is hot
i love my life a lot
im never sad just glad
thats why i thank my dad
once they never gave a fuck about
what i said
now they listen and they want my head

instead of peace the police
just wanna wreck and flex
on the kid
what i did was try to be the best
so they fingered the trigger
figured i was a bigger nigger
and started to search
an so i headed west
went to cally a rally
was for a brothers death
it was the fuzz who shot him
an not da blood or cuzz
i wondered why it was like
so i just held my mike
but in my mind i was blind
so i just tried to find
a reason we was quick
just the way that we was
so i just stayed in the crib
until i got a buzzchuck d

burn hollywood burn i smell a riot

yeah ill check out a movie
but itll take a black one to move me

as i walk the streets of hollywood boulevard
thinin how hard it was to those that starred
in the movies portrayin the roles
of butlers and maids slaves and hoes
many intelligent black men seemed to look uncivilized
when on the screen
like a guess i figure you to play some jigaboo
on the plantation what else can a nigger do
and black women in this profession
as for playin a lawyer out of the question
for what they play aunt jemima is the perfect term
even if now she got a perm
so lets make our own movies like spike lee
cause the roles being offered dont strike me
theres nothing that the black man could use to earn
burn hollywood burnand you thought the beat slowed down
power to the people
get on up get into it get involved

and try to be the best and
let everybody know before i blow
for the sake of whats right
i wanna know who stole the soul

and holidays notice some of them are heller days
invented by those who never repented
for the sins within that killed my kin

the fingers pointed to us in our direction
the blind state of mind needs correction

of the stage wit

frustrations of the majori

dj i do understand that

caller but before he came on you were -

dj if you had read the stuff i had read about him and the way 
hes been portrayed in american press-i got so much trouble on my mind
i refuse to lose
heres your ticket

the crew to you to push the back to black
attack so i sat and japped
then slapped the macintosh
now im ready to mike it
you know i like it huh
hear my favoritism roll oh
never be a brother like to go solo
lazer anastasia maze ya
ways to blaze your brain and train ya
the way im livin forgiven
what im givin up
x on the flex hit me now
i dont know about later
as for now i know how to avoid the paranoid
man ive had it up to here
gear i wear got em goin in fear
rhetoric said
read just a bit ago
not quittin though
signed the hard rhymer
work to keep from gettin jerked
changin some ways
to way back in the better days
raw metaphysically bold
never followed a code
still dropped a load
never question what i am god knows
cause its comin from the heart
what i got better get some
get on up hustler of culture
snakebitten
been spit in the face
but the rhymes keep fittin
respects been givin hows ya livin
now i cant protect a pad off defect
check the record
an reckon an intentional wreck
played off as some intellect
made the call took the fall
broke the laws
not my fault theyre fallin off
known as fair square
throughout my years
so i growl at the livin foul
black to the bone my home is your home
so welcome to the terrordome
subordinate terror
kickin off an era
cold deliverin pain
my 98 was 87 on a record yo
so now i go bronco

crucifixion aint no fiction
so called chosen frozen
apology made to who ever pleases
still they got me like jesus
i rather sing bring think reminisce
bout a brother while im in sync
every brother aint a brother cause a color
just as well could be undercover
backstabbed grabbed a flag
from the back of the lab
told a rab get off the rag
sad to say i got sold down the river
still some quiver when i deliver
never to say i never know or had a clue
word was heard plus hard on the boulevard
lies scandalizin basin
traits of hate whos celebratin wit satan
i rope a dope the evil with righteous
bobbin and weavin and let the good get even
cmon down
and welcome to the terrordome
caught in the race against time
the pit and the pendulum
check the rhythm and rhymes
while im bendin em
snakes blowin up the lines of design
tryin to blind the science im snedin em
how to fight the power
cannot run and hide
but it shouldnt be suicide
in a game a fool without the rules
got a hell of a nerve to just criticize
every brother aint a brother
cause a black hand
squeezed on malcom x the man
the shootin of huey newton
from a hand of a nigger who pulled the trigger

its weak to speak and blame somebody else
when you destroy yourself
first nothings worse than a mothers pain
of a son slain in bensonhurst
cant wait for the state to decide the fate
so this jam i dedicate
places with racist faces
just an example of one of many cases
the greek weekend speech i speak
from a lesson learned in virginia beach
i dont smile in the line of fire
i go wildin
but its on bass and drums even violins
watcha do gitcha head ready
instead of gettin physically sweaty
when i get mad
i put it down on a pad
give ya somethin that cha never had controllin
fear of high rollin
god bless your soul and keep livin
never allowed kickin it loud
droppin a bomb
brain game intellectual vietnam
move as a team
never move alone
but
welcome to the terrordomeman to man
i dont know if they can
from what i know
the parts dont fit
ahh shit
how hes sharin a needle
with a drug addict
he dont believe he has it
either
but now he does he doesnt know cause he
goes straight to a ho
tell you what who was next on the but
wild thinin on a germ
runnin wild
yo stop
but the bag poppedshe wants a lover right now
but not no brother
her man gotta have a lotta money
to get under her cover
now shes a fine sister
but up here shes missin it
she says she wanna learn about life
no old black bull shit
at the age of 15 a brother gave her a baby
shes 19 now and it drover her crazy
and now everytime
she turns around
all the people in the neighborhood
look and get mand and sing

chorus

meet mr succesful
i guess hes blessed yeah
but he happens to be a brother
who only wants blue eyes and blonde hair
now this young mister
he dont like sisters
he couldnt find that special one
he know why he missed her
he says sisters wasnt good enuff
they only wanted his green stuff
thats why everytime he turned
around all the people
in the neighborhood
looked and got mad
and sang

chorus

i try to tell my people
there should not be any hatred
for a brother or a sister
whose opposite race theyve mated
no man is god
and god put us all here yeah
but this system has no wisdom
the devil split us in pairs
and taught us white is good black is bad
and black and white is still too bad
thats why everytime i turn around
all the people in my neighborhood
look mad and sing

choruswhen im talkin rhyme time
to blow your mind time some say
its nothing worse than a verse
to hear some nigger curse
they call me rude some dudes fiery attitude
claimin i boast and smoke
and sometimes sing the blues
i twang metal and settle
try to never back pedal
from the power some got
to get a nigger shot
the null and void i avoid
i test the paranoid
never had to be bad
my mama raised me mad
so what i got is hot
i love my life a lot
im never sad just glad
thats why i thank my dad
once they never gave a fuck about
what i said
now they listen and they want my head

instead of peace the police
just wanna wreck and flex
on the kid
what i did was try to be the best
so they fingered the trigger
figured i was a bigger nigger
and started to search
an so i headed west
went to cally a rally
was for a brothers death
it was the fuzz who shot him
an not da blood or cuzz
i wondered why it was like
so i just held my mike
but in my mind i was blind
so i just tried to find
a reason we was quick
just the way that we was
so i just stayed in the crib
until i got a buzzchuck d

burn hollywood burn i smell a riot
goin on first theyre guilty now theyre gone
yeah ill check out a movie
but itll take a black one to move me

big daddy kane

as i walk the streets of hollywood boulevard
thinin how hard it was to those that starred
in the movies portrayin the roles
of butlers and maids slaves and hoes
many intelligent black men seemed to look uncivilized
when on the screen
like a guess i figure you to play some jigaboo
on the plantation what else can a nigger do
and black women in this profession
as for playin a lawyer out of the question
for what they play aunt jemima is the perfect term
even if now she got a perm
so lets make our own movies like spike lee
cause the roles being offered dont strike me
theres nothing that the black man could use to earn
burn hollywood burnand you thought the beat slowed down
power to the people
get on up get into it get involved

they im wrong for singin a song
without solutions
all the dancers answer questions
and try to be the best and
let everybody know before i blow
for the sake of whats right
i wanna know who stole the soul

we choose to use their ways
and holidays notice some of them are heller days
invented by those who never repented
for the sins within that killed my kin
but thats all right
i try do what a brother does
but ill never know if youre my cuz
thats why i try my best to unite
and damn the rest if they dont like it

i think he went upstairs yknow
dj a very furious mixture of noise
what public enemy producer hank shocklee calls
musics worst nightmare

hey hes a good kid

chuck d air hoodlum repeat 2x
tony d check check check the elevation repeat 4x

a player that can leap with the best of them

verse one

risin up in the velt strong island new york
the hood in case you did not know my base
there was a ballplayer who had all the skills
wit the pill to pay the piper plus all the bills
mick his first name mack the awesome game
practiced in the heat in the rain or in pain
mick so quick at six foot six
down to be picked by anyone but the celtics
oh what a handle could score from the floor
with people bangin on him or even hangin on him
but what he did best above all the rest was

a player that can leap with the best of them
as a high school standout
the skywalker himself
i felt he could do to make this an effective basketball team

verse two

grades nine and ten mickey mack was all that
but in class his ass sat way in the back
how i know cause i know i used to flow wit the bro
he didnt mind i used to read him his own headline
cause he could not read em his school wouldnt need em
if the lines wouldnta went like this
mickey mack jumped over the candlestick
his stack was his stats but his d was still wack
grades eleven and twelve he found the wrong clientele and all
during class he would dribble in the hall
but never got in trouble in school but the trouble was
it was cool if your brain was just another bubble
as long as he could score fiddy-two
get thirty-three rebounds fuckin around
temas lost to him he went right through em
division county state thats three count em
championships for a small town bro
thats bound to go pro

he gets free turn on the jumper good
streak of lightning when he breaks loose
we all felt in our hearts we could win this ballgame
they just required me to have the game that i did
im just thats all i thats all i thats all i can say
thats all i can say
he hauled down fifteeen rebounds and kept the ball away from everybody
then he had a triple double
a-a-a sensational player

verse three

sats didnt matter cause he was all that
you know the pat on the back
he was always in the news you gotta know what it means
it means revenue and im tellin you
i saw cars and gs come to our school please
approach hell with the principal wheres the coach
went to college four years wit a scholarship
and won the championship
but when it came to his life he didnt care
cause he took it to the air

cross and a hook he scores hes fouled
from the far corner breaks west and heres the jumper good
theres the jumper its not gonna go rebound batted back

chuck d air

verse four

the fall began when mickey mack fell
hell ripped his kneee drafted last by personnel
oh how he loved the game it was fantastic
until he was cut and couldnt stick
times got tighter and tighter
he had an attitude was rude so he turned into a fighter
school wouldnt give him the job that he needed
assistant to the assistant coach they didnt need it
then he resorted to a stick up kid
ski-mask and gat but this game he wasnt good at
and the drugs on the side
police ambushed his ride *gunfire* another homicide
he was over ghost yknow
hometown hero but now a zero
to those hypocrites who ripped him blind
for his skills without the will to develop his mind
forever in the news the community views him
only as air hoodlum

word from the honorable elijah muhammed

to those that disagree it causes static
for the original black asiatic man
cream of the earth
and was here first
and some devils prevent this from being known
but you check out the books they own
even masons they know it

verse in the middle of class
instead of singin bout bombs

land of the free
home of the brave
and hell with us niggas we slaves
that shoulda been the last line
of a song thats wrong form to get
so when everybody stand

500 years ago one man claimed
to have discovered a new world

masta killa

sliding down broadway beneath the j line
slumped in the incline position
mind travellin beyond the shell
which holds the soul controlled by the allah
i be most humble but also punishable
for those who are unlawful to righteousness
i strive to stay alive and live this
many fell victim to the wisdom 
i mastered this
the track ovulates the mic like prostate gland imperegnates
onto the paper the pain pours
for the love of my brother that hurts just the same
fuck fame
my gun i bust to maintain
moods are insiduous
baffels and eludes those who label the god being anti-social
chose not to apply their third eye
i travel at the speed of thought rate
its fatal
what will enable a man to levitate

flava flav

and you can take that and put that on the back of your brain
coming straight to you from masta killa

you never heard a murder
take for example
unsolved mystery
life lost in a funk sample
enter the bandwagons

what was criticized six years back
is now back
with new york on the jersey front and back
feel like tiger woods

way up from the cheap seats
comin outta the hood
race to the black seats
amongst the wack seats
be the hardcore
alongside the deadbeats
the world lookin on
like spectators
at crucified gladiators
feels like a jungle inside
where fish swim birds fly
man got a tendency to die
man falls to the hands of man
but damn if ill ever try
to survive at courtside
four tickets to fly
rap or play ball do the game
or duck the drive by

same league that defends
be the same ones that do us in
spys

heard the war is on

bound to get the crowd
bouncin
yes and it counts and
in this corner representin the

i aint seen a winner yet you
the confused crowd boos
the move shit
in that corner
number one in the east
the peace cursed for life
by the mark of the beast
raised by peeps rode jeeps
deep in brooklyn beats
praised as a hero
who came up off the streets
the crowd looks on
claimin sides they dont own
a house built up on
their skulls and bones
knew it be a matter of time
the play by play
two rappers slain

crowd goin crazy
gettin bigger
proud to be called a bunch

the ghetto stage fulla
field nigga goals
hip hop shoot outs vs those house negros
five bodies got on the shot clock
runnin down in the count made
the scoreboard rock
the referees the lapd
the lvpd
said they couldnt catch
what they couldnt see
question
was it bigger than the names
not only in the game
but the game behind the game
down to the remaining
seconds of this record
anatomy of a murder
intensity of a mystery
dead and gone
as the heads looked on
helpless
as the atmosphere preyed on
investigating
and the winner be
interscope/uni arista/bmg
lost in overtime
da tombstone trophy for people that shit
the rhymes that died

verse 1 chuck d
the way this goes down is simple from this day forth
anything to deal with rap stay off

if youre brains the same youll stick to your deals
and this field aint about sellin a mil
with the run of the mill so just be tellin the real
it aint like a third time fellas appeal
til the god scolds him and tells him to deal
ill allow you to write maybe allow you to bite
if youre down to fight the power heres the power to fight
overpower the mic hit the crowd with the bomb diggy
ring the alarm now the squads with me
from way back i show now weakness when i speak this
mentally strong to keep this hit in my speeches given
now listen from the beginnin til i reach the endin
my short stories winnin and keep the beats spinnin

verse 2 chuck d

through the fast lane in the game they follow my speed
either ease off the gas or floor it
you aint ready to get it i dunno why they keep askin for it
this the real pe aint no castin for it
cop lights news camera no action for it
get the uncut raw we somewhat sure
hip hops like a chess game discussin the war
strategize move like masterminds
when its your go and your do just cash mine
last time we welcomed yall to the terrordome
used the mic to reach out and touch instead of the phone
i appear from the rear stayin from clear
nobody can say if im here so they play it by ear
but heres the way i lay the idea
from this point on the rest of 98 put it in high gear

i spit gold versus the pearl hooks
the first album made the world crooks
got em snatchin robbin thievin stealin ideas
believe in pleadin reason for treason conceal it for years
my criminal  attract an accomplice to grub something
results drastic measures
and the death of joy the death of casket treasure

was leadin them to believe my mothers clit didnt exist
then i extended the list
revolutioned every flag raised by a clenchin fist

gettin pages from his super agent 
community raises at the clout or the cages

&gt;from behind crazies flippin through the faces
paper chases love that many places
pros and cons flics between the races
he hold the rock call for sweat shops
guard the set shop replaced by sex shops
the highest bidder no room for the quitter
gave seven tickets under counterfittas
three cities a week droppin needles

analysis of the situations
bringing forth alarming revelations

words from the wise comin from the dead
not alivei came from a place i forgot
i woke up in a parking lot
far from a meal and a cot
on the corner
where all the streets got the same name
maybe my brains on the brink of insane
pain between the papers while sleepin on the train
this the land of milk and honey
know what im sayin
the invisible man times three
black down and out
out standing on a corner no doubt
now a nation of homeless
sleepin in bus stations
another win for the pilgrims
who said no more haitians
as i proceed
someone to feed me is what i need
through three blocks of dealers
tryin to hit me off wit weed
avenue and boulevard hungry as a motherfucker
hope to get a ride from a trucker
everybody know i aint no sucker
everyone used to drop 30 at the rucker
away from crazy kids in generation wrecked
dissin pyramids while praisin projects
walk past old folks gettin no respect
callin young folks a bunch a no good rejects
and i walk on

an eye for an eye
i cant recognize the man in the mirror
is it i it is i now who this cat im lookin at
cause ive been waiting so long to get where im goin
an eye for a eye in this country tis of thee
now how the hell can i be free
who this cat im lookin at
cause i been lost so long without anybody knowin

so i move on and i walk on
past the preachers and the pimps gettin their talk on
now why do home gotta be where the negative roam
to be or not to be so i roll alone
im trapped within this skin and these bones
temporary kings on cellular phones
can i last as i walk past
cigarette billboards and malt liquor ads
walkin on broken bottles and potato chip bags
everyone i see got the nerve to brag
where they from what they got
and dont own squat
disrespect where they from and ya might get shot
zombies askin me what the latest bomb bay
should shot the fuckin sheriff and the fuckin deputy
for ok in the drug trade and lettin it be
but i know prison for me is an industry
so i walk
i heard the best things in life be free
didnt god make the land the air we breathe
not for the homeless dont give a damn about me
in the mirror somebody else is starin at me
maybe prison is the skin im within
all this time i been sufferin cant fix it wit a bufferin
plus they said ill never work in this town again
damn so i keep on walkin

an eye for an eye
i cant recognize the man in the mirror
is it i it is i now who this cat im lookin at
cause ive been waiting so long to get where im goin
an eye for an eye in this country tis of thee
now how the hell can i be free
who this cat im lookin at
cause i been lost so long without anybody knowin

but i doubt if they doin any better than me
so i walk on never take the planet for granted
i paved the concrete asphalt and granite
i walk pastast three brothers sittin on the porch
wit a yard of dirt and littered wit newports
talkin how they comin up while they sittin on their ass
as i walk past em im a target of their laughs
and one said lets get em for his fuckin stash
as i walked fast past the other yards wit grass
had a lil cash tried to make it last
from a few deals i made from cleanin windshields
i ran like a rally they caught me in an alley
cant get out the ghetto from new york to cali
i thought i had nothin till i felt the knife

you deserve what you deserve 
if you believe what he believes 
and into everything you leave 
oh what a tangled web you weave
when destroyed by the disease by 33 degrees
bringing satan down to his kneesa dollar a rhyme but we barely get a dime

yo chuck run a power move on them

[yeeaahh]

[verse 1 - chuck d]
step back get away - give the brother some room
you got to all turn me up when the beat goes boom
lyric to lyric - line to line
then you yall understand my reputation for rhyme
cause my rhyme reputation depends on what
style of record my dj cuts
his slice an dice - super mix so nice
so bad you wont dispute the price
cause its plain to see - its a strain to be
number one in the public eye enemy
cause im wanted in 50 - almost 51
states where the posse got me on the run
its a big wonder why i havent gone under
dodgin all types of microphone thunder
a fugitive missin all types of hell
all this because i talk so well
when i

rock - get up - get down
miuzi weighs a ton
hold it 

[verse 2 - chuck d]
the match up title - the expression of thrill
for elite to compete and attempt to get ill
if looks could kill - id chill until
all the public catches on to my material - you know
the ducks criticize my every phase of rapture
cant wait to read the headlines of my capture
accused of assault - a 1st degree crime
cause i beat competitors with my rhyme
tongue whipped pushed shoved and tripped
choked from the hold of my kung fu grip
and if you want my title - it would be suicidal
from my end - it would be homicidal
when i do work - you get destroyed
all the paranoid - know to avoid
the public enemy seat ive enjoyed
this is no kid and im not no toy boy

rock - get up - get down
miuzi weighs a ton
hold it

[verse 3 - chuck d]
im a public enemy but i dont rob banks
i dont shoot bullets and i dont shoot blanks
my style is supreme - number one is my rank
and i got more power than the new york yanks
if miuzi wasnt heavy id probably fire it
id make you walk the plank if i was a pirate
if they made me a king - i would be a tyrant
if you want to get me - go ahead and try it
snatcher dispatcher biter never been a
instead of takin me out - take a girl to dinner
the level of comp has never been thinner
its a runaway race where im the winner
its unreal - they call the law
and claimed i had started a war
it was war they wanted and war they got
but they wilted in the heat when miuzi got hot

rock - get up - get down
miuzi weighs a ton
hold it

[verse 4 - chuck d]
my style versatile said without rhymes
which is why theyre after me an on my back
lookin over my shoulder - seein what i write
hearin what i say - then wonderin why
why they cant ever compete on my level
superstar status is my domain
understand my rhythm - my pattern of lecture
and then youll know why im on the run
this change of events results in a switch
its the lateral movement of my vocal pitch
it eliminates pressure on the haunted
but the posse is around so i got to front it
plus employ tactics so coy
and leave no choice but to destroy
soloists groups and what they say
and all that try to cross my way
when i


rock - get up - get down
miuzi weighs a ton
hold it

[outro]
yeah thats right
public enemy number one in new york
public enemy number one in philly
public enemy number one in dc
public enemy number one in cleveland ohio
also where public enemy number one in st louis
public enemy number one in new jersey
and bust it
where also public enemy number one in cincinnati
in atlantacant understand some of these 
rhymin in circles
now patroitic emcees
on bent knees 
by six degrees
lord have mercy
even the voice of god rehearses
attack of the 50 ft verses
supermama this time around gotta few curses
papa gotta new bag of cant get
worse comes to worse 
cant get enough
of tryin it
sayin nothing goin noplace no time soon
but buyin it
like gettin in a car without drivin it
still black rock the wax like stax
i rip  i mix
full screen like imax
so i max 
relax
off the deep end
get deep in the record
100 beats per second
cut down the like rhymes
cause they get redundant
refuse to stoop to stupid
cause they dumbed it
down
like motown
say it loud
damn
like im the new james brown uh

put it up repeat


rocked the concoction
a potion of too much emotion
uhim a keep it in motion
call it whatcha wanna
bus stop lectric slide cha cha
funky 16 corners

hot like jill scotts blues 
but damn too old for 22s
but i can still move
groove
lets roll
you cant do your thing 
if your things the wrong thing
tax the payers
stack paper
but you failed as an eighth grader
dumb ass
failed every math class
plus i know this like otis

f -it thats how it gos
beyond the cornrows
if i cant talk  get to steppin
tougue can be a tool and weapon
listen

put it up repeat


tycoons
damn im tired of these coons
rhymin in circles
words can either help or hurt you
or be neutral
cats still might shoot you
what suits you 
if you gots issues
a thousand tatoos
confused in 200 dollar gym shoes
spendin more than u got
2002 blues

and if you want to fight the power
you have to be the power
strengthen the mind
and bury the weapons that you need to win
stay in school and stay away from drugs

if you dont wanna be a goner
stay away from the drugs on the corner

public enemy salutes the youth of today

scrapin
heads off the street
sendin cats to the middle of heat
far in the so called middle east
somebody gotta
communicate 
beyond the beats

5 retail chains

to consume anything
with a bang and a boom 
gimme room

but 4 major corps

sony time warner universal 
notorius bmg

3 radio corporations

black stations

i dont know about later
as for now i know how to avoid the paranoid
man ive had it up to here
gear i wear got em goin in fear
rhetoric said
read just a bit ago
not quittin though
signed the hard rhymer
work to keep from gettin jerked
changin some ways
to way back in the better days
raw metaphysically bold
never followed a code
still dropped a load
never question what i am god knows
cause its comin from the heart
what i got better get some
get on up hustler of culture
snakebitten
been spit in the face
but the rhymes keep fittin
respects been givin hows ya livin
now i cant protect a pad off defect
check the record
an reckon an intentional wreck
played off as some intellect
made the call took the fall
broke the laws
not my fault theyre fallin off
known as fair square
throughout my years
so i growl at the livin foul
black to the bone my home is your home
so welcome to the terrordome
subordinate terror
kickin off an era
cold deliverin pain
my 98 was 87 on a record yo
so now i go bronco

crucifixion aint no fiction
so called chosen frozen
apology made to who ever pleases
still they got me like jesus
i rather sing bring think reminisce
bout a brother while im in sync
every brother aint a brother cause a color
just as well could be undercover
backstabbed grabbed a flag
from the back of the lab
told a rab get off the rag
sad to say i got sold down the river
still some quiver when i deliver
never to say i never know or had a clue
word was heard plus hard on the boulevard
lies scandalizin basin
traits of hate whos celebratin wit satan
i rope a dope the evil with righteous
bobbin and weavin and let the good get even
cmon down
and welcome to the terrordome
caught in the race against time
the pit and the pendulum
check the rhythm and rhymes
while im bendin em
snakes blowin up the lines of design
tryin to blind the science im snedin em
how to fight the power
cannot run and hide
but it shouldnt be suicide
in a game a fool without the rules
got a hell of a nerve to just criticize
every brother aint a brother
cause a black hand
squeezed on malcom x the man
the shootin of huey newton
from a hand of a nigger who pulled the trigger

its weak to speak and blame somebody else
when you destroy yourself
first nothings worse than a mothers pain
of a son slain in bensonhurst
cant wait for the state to decide the fate
so this jam i dedicate
places with racist faces
just an example of one of many cases
the greek weekend speech i speak
from a lesson learned in virginia beach
i dont smile in the line of fire
i go wildin
but its on bass and drums even violins
watcha do gitcha head ready
instead of gettin physically sweaty
when i get mad
i put it down on a pad
give ya somethin that cha never had controllin
fear of high rollin

yo black some of you are all in
to make sure the crowd

from all sides come the wicked
governments
fundamentalists
but how you gonna
kill the innocent
between terrorists 
and cia hit lists
like my man uno says
beware the false prophets
gotta be smarter than this
they say war is a profit
with loved ones missed
but death is a debt
none of us aint seen war yet
be careful what you ask for
war is hell and hell is war
all them bling bling thangs throw em in the river
all that thugged out sh*t yall cant deliver
seen four planes kill everyday folks
guess 911 aint no joke
wall street cryin broke
was it god
or the devil itself
who spoke
old vampires
hit the new empire
had the sky cookin
brooklyn had no other choice 
but to stare and keep lookin
city smile
missin two front teeth
while some of yall 
still talkin them little ass beefs
over who what soundscanned

this month you sound scared
guessin where the party at
while downtowns wonderin
where the bodies at

how you sell soul to a souless people
who sold their soul
keep the people from bein sheeple
followin
hollow voices
to tommorrows sorrow
women have nurtured
and birthed the earth
man has killed many
for land and worse
women got a cycle thats spoken for
man has a period its called war
may the power go to
everyday people
may war have no sequel live
reverse the word you get evil
cause people wanna live against evil
avoid the third world war
biological bombs
100 times worse than vietnam
so what you gonna do
if you was on that plane 
both sides wouldve killed you too
to my peoples
stay on your ps and qs
get your sh*t togethercheck this out
this is chuck d

and this is flavor flav
and public enemy is lettin yall know about black history month

february is black history month
but wed like to say that every single month
we should recognise the rich culture
and heritage of black people
although the battles have not been won yet
we should be proud to take some time out this month
to explore the powerful and victorious lineage of our people

thats right so dont be a vulture
and learn your culture

pe salutes the history of black people
and the history that we are yet to make

thats right not a mistakei testified
my mama cried
black people died
when the other man lied
see the tv listen to me double trouble
i overhaul and im comin
from the lower level
im takin tabs
sho nuff stuff to grab
like shirts it hurts
wit a neck to wreck
took a poll cause our soul
took a toll
from the education
of a tv station
but look around
hear go the sound of the wreckin ball
boom and pound
when i
shut em down
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
what i use in the battle for the mind
i hit it hard
like it supposed
pullin no blows to the nose
like uncle l said im rippin up shows
then what it is
only 5 percent of the biz
im addin woes
thats how da way it goes
then u think i rank never drank point blank
i own loans
suckers got me runnin from the bank
civil liberty i cant see to pay a fee
i never saw a way to pay a sap
to read the law
then become a victim of a lawyer
dont know ya never saw ya
tape cued
gettin me sued
playin games wit my head
what the judge said put me in the red
got me thinkin bout a trigger to the lead
no no
my education mind say
suckers gonna pay
anyway
there gonna be a day
cause the troop they roll in
to posse up
whole from the ground
ready to go
throw another round
sick of the ride
its suicide
for the other side of town
when i find a way to shut em down
who count the money
in da neigborhood
but we spendin money
to no end lookin for a friend
in a war to the core
rippin up the poor in da stores
till they get a brother
kickin down doors
then i figure i kick it bigger
look em dead in the eye
and they wince
defense is pressurized
they dont want it to be
another racial attack
in disguise so give some money back
i like nike but wait a minite
the neighborhood supports so put some
money in it

dey gotta give up the dough
to da town
or else
we gotta shut em down[intro flavor flav]

i dont know what this world is coming to

yes - the rhythm the rebel
without a pause - im lowering my level
the hard rhymer - where you never been im in
you want stylin - you know its time again
d the enemy - tellin you to hear it
they praised the music - this time they play the lyrics
some say no to the album the show
bum rush the sound i made a year ago
i guess you know - you guess im just a radical
not a sabbatical - yes to make it critical
the only part your body should be parting to
panther power on the hour from the rebel to you

radio - suckers never play me
on the mix - just ok me
now known and grown when theyre clocking my zone its known
snakin and takin everything that a brother owns
hard - my calling card
recorded and orderd - supporter of chesimard
loud and proud kickin live next poet supreme
loop a troop bazooka the scheme
flavor - a rebel in his own mind
supporter of my rhyme
designed to scatter a line of suckers who claim i do crime

terminator x

from a rebel its final on black vinyl
soul rock and roll comin like a rhino
tables turn - suckers burn to learn
they cant dis-able the power of my label
def jam - tells you who i am
the enemys public - they really give a damn
strong island - where i got em wild and
thats the reason theyre claimin that im violent
never silent - no dope gettin dumb nope
claimin where we get our rhythm from
number one - we hit ya and we give ya some
no gun - and still never on the run
you wanna be an s1 - griff will tell you when
and then youll come - youll know what time it is
impeach the president - pullin out the ray-gun
zap the next one - i could be youre sho-gun
suckers - dont last a minute
soft and smooth - i aint with it
hardcore - rawbone like a razor

that we knew you lacked
they still consider me a new jack
all the critics you can hangem

and pray it aint dope
the follower of farrakhan
dont tell me that you understand
until you hear the man
the book of the new school rap game

until the whole juice crew
gets me in my goose down
i do the rebel yell
and im the duracell
call it plain insane
brothers causein me pain
when a brothers a victim
and the sellers a dweller in a cage
yo run the accapella
power of the people sayi got a letter from the government
the other day
i opened and read it
it said they were suckers
they wanted me for their army or whatever
picture me given a damn - i said never
here is a land that never gave a damn
about a brother like me and myself
because they never did
i wasnt wit it but just that very minute
it occured to me
the suckers had authority
cold sweatin as i dwell in my cell
how long has it been
they got me sittin in the state pen
i gotta get out - but that thought was thought before
i contemplated a plan on the cell floor
im not a fugitive on the run
but a brother like me begun - to be another one
public enemy servin time - they drew the line yall
to criticize me some crime - never the less
they could not understand that im a black man
and i could never be a veteran
on the strength the situations unreal
i got a raw deal so im goin for the steel

they got me rottin in the time that im servin
tellin you what happened the same time theyre throwin
4 of us packed in a cell like slaves - oh well
the same motherfucker got us livin is his hell
you have to realize - what its a form of slavery
organized under a swarm of devils
straight up - wordem up on the level
the reasons are several most of them federal
here is my plan anyway and i say
i got gusto but only some i can trust - yo
some do a bid from 1 to 10
and i never did and plus i never been
im on a tier where no tears should ever fall
cell block and locked - i never clock it yall
cause time and time again time
they got me servin to those and to them
im not a citizen
but ever when i catch a c-o
sleepin on the job - my plan is on go-ahead
on the strength ima tell you the deal
i got nothin to lose
cause im goin for the steel

you know i caught a c-o
fallin asleep on death row
i grabbed his gun - then he did what i said so
and everymans got served
along with the time they served
decency was deserved
to understand my demands
i gave a warnin - i wanted the governor yall
and plus the warden to know
that i was innocent -
because im militant
posing a threat you bet its fuckin up the government
my plan said i had to get out and break north
just like with olivers neck
i had to get off - my boys had the feds in check
they couldnt do nuthin
we had a force to instigate a prison riot
this is what it takes for peace
so i just took the piece
black for black inside time to cut the leash
freedom to get out - to the ghetto - no sell out
6 c-os we got we ought to put their head out
but ill give em a chance cause im civilized
as for the rest of the world they cant realize
a cell is hell - im a rebel so i rebel
between bars got me thinkin like an animal
got a woman c-o to call me a copter
she tried to get away and i popped her
twice right
now who wanna get nice
i had 6 c-os now its 5 to go
and im serious - call me delirious
but im still a captive
i gotta rap this
time to break as time grows intense
i got the steel in my right hand
now im lookin for the fence

i ventured into the courtyard
followed by 52 brothers
bruised battered and scarred but hard
goin out with a bang
ready to bang out
but power from the sky
and from the tower shots rang out
a high number of dose - yes
and some came close
figure i trigger my steel
stand and hold my post
this is what i mean - an anti-nigger machine
if i come out alive and then they wont - come clean
and then i threw up my steel bullets - flew up
blew up who shot
what who the bazooka was who
and to my rescue it was the s1ws
secured my getaway so i just gotaway
the joint broke from the black smoke
then they saw it was rougher thatn the average bluffer
cause the steel was black the attitude exact
now the chase is on tellin you to cmon
53 brothers on the run and we are gone1989 the number another summer get down
sound of the funky drummer

chorus

what counts is that the rhymes
designed to fill your mind

we got to pump the stuff to make us tough
from the heart

to revolutionize make a change nothins strange
people people we are the same

cause we dont know the game
what we need is awareness we cant get careless

my beloved lets get down to business
mental self defensive fitness

make everybody see in order to fight the powers that be
lemme hear you say

chorus

elvis was a hero to most
but he never meant shit to me you see
straight up racist that sucker was
simple and plain
mother fuck him and john wayne

the crew to you to push the back to black
attack so i sat and japped
then slapped the macintosh
now im ready to mike it
you know i like it huh

lazer anastasia maze ya
ways to blaze your brain and train ya
the way im livin forgiven
what im givin up
x on the flex hit me now
i dont know about later
as for now i know how to avoid the paranoid
man ive had it up to here
gear i wear got em goin in fear
rhetoric said
read just a bit ago
not quittin though
signed the hard rhymer
work to keep from gettin jerked
changin some ways
to way back in the better days
raw metaphysically bold
never followed a code
still dropped a load
never question what i am god knows
cause its comin from the heart
what i got better get some
get on up hustler of culture
snakebitten
been spit in the face
but the rhymes keep fittin
respects been givin hows ya livin
now i cant protect a pad off defect
check the record
an reckon an intentional wreck
played off as some intellect
made the call took the fall
broke the laws
not my fault theyre fallin off
known as fair square
throughout my years
so i growl at the livin foul
black to the bone my home is your home
so welcome to the terrordome
subordinate terror
kickin off an era
cold deliverin pain
my 98 was 87 on a record yo
so now i go bronco

crucifixion aint no fiction
so called chosen frozen
apology made to who ever pleases
still they got me like jesus
i rather sing bring think reminisce
bout a brother while im in sync
every brother aint a brother cause a color
just as well could be undercover
backstabbed grabbed a flag
from the back of the lab
told a rab get off the rag
sad to say i got sold down the river
still some quiver when i deliver
never to say i never know or had a clue
word was heard plus hard on the boulevard
lies scandalizin basin
traits of hate whos celebratin wit satan
i rope a dope the evil with righteous
bobbin and weavin and let the good get even
cmon down
and welcome to the terrordome
caught in the race against time
the pit and the pendulum
check the rhythm and rhymes
while im bendin em
snakes blowin up the lines of design
tryin to blind the science im snedin em
how to fight the power
cannot run and hide
but it shouldnt be suicide
in a game a fool without the rules
got a hell of a nerve to just criticize
every brother aint a brother
cause a black hand
squeezed on malcom x the man
the shootin of huey newton
from a hand of a nigger who pulled the trigger

its weak to speak and blame somebody else
when you destroy yourself
first nothings worse than a mothers pain
of a son slain in bensonhurst
cant wait for the state to decide the fate
so this jam i dedicate
places with racist faces
just an example of one of many cases
the greek weekend speech i speak
from a lesson learned in virginia beach
i dont smile in the line of fire
i go wildin
but its on bass and drums even violins
watcha do gitcha head ready
instead of gettin physically sweaty
when i get mad
i put it down on a pad
give ya somethin that cha never had controllin
fear of high rollin
god bless your soul and keep livin
never allowed kickin it loud
droppin a bomb
brain game intellectual vietnam
move as a team
never move alone
but
welcome to the terrordomehit me
going going gone

so you turn your head
race scared of its shadow

thought areparations
got em playin wit the population
nothing to lose
everythings approved
people used
even murders excused
white men in suits
dont have to jump
still theres 1001 ways
to lose wit the shoes
god takes care of ol folks and fools
while the devil takes care
of makin the rules

who aint kissin it
the politics of chains and whips
got the sick
missin chips and championships
whats love got to do

dont let a win get to your head
or a loss to your heart

ownin the labels stations jails and cemeteries
thug life
turnin hip hop into a one stop shop

see the government
sweep it deeper
under the rug

maybe 
maybe im 
preachin to the quiet

talk the talk
walk the walk

im preachin to the quiet[societys verse]
we was raised in these streets on pork and poison meat
now i recognize the beast and bare the mark of the gold teeth
puff on the rolled leaf and bust on the police
while yall playas are fakin bacon we cook the whole beef
i put it down plain i stimulate the left and right brain
cell by cell and frame by frame
names dates are all inmaterial i big dick sick ryhme killer like cereal i
burn like venerial and spit that imperial wizardry that climbs right through
the curcitry
choake your team for their cream but thats as far as we go
drop shit like seaguls and smash your little ego
i get visions like stevie and coleco
give me 2000 live people
one late show no seaquel
aint no equal in the flesh
i been through more evil than men do
nasty off the head and with the pen too

[chucks verse]
now im pissed
easy to rhyme on tracks like this
the more things change
the more they remain the same
these games them vidiots
playin on the brink of insane
must be a hockey rink
lost in their drink
in pursuit of plain jane
i think man they think a revolution be pretty in pink
now in these new tracks
some of these cats dont know how to act
all them criminal acts aint got nuttin to do wit rap
one hand cuffuffed behind them backs in black
quiet riot yall cant hear one hand clap
revolution is more than what you hear and what you see
the mass reintroduction
of society to society

forever in a plantation state
damn this is why i hate hate

who got human features
let the whole world reach you
things classrooms cant teach you
now can you dig it
sing the song till we all get along
feed the poor
damn the law
when they trained em taught em
killed em when they caught em
set up wet up
when they no longer could afford em
put disease across the seas
got the third world on their knees
get it
as long as the people got something to say

as long as the people got something to say

[griff verse 2]
at this critical junction the administration cant function
taking our civil liberties over high price luncheons its nothin when your considered a sheepole
as long as the people got something to say
we the people

they need a war to justify the taking of lives they manage the lie behind the lie behind the lie
now you cant run and hide its high tech genocide
they never taught you the truth or how to survive
they clone doctors to put a spin on it
hip hop heads to shook to pull the cover off it

it may effect there sales tip the scale
the way it looks theyll end up dead or in jail

we busy spinning and grinning on 26s you sitting
change your god for your wealth thinking heaven your gettin

you must be pre-sistance in mass resistance
love thy enemy and make this committment
to engage in struggle with a clench fist lift it
be true to self before the god end this

yo public enemy we back in yourin the whip tryin to a grip
on how to bring the next and the new shit brain lit
no pen no pad this the sickest illest thought
i ever had thoughts of my ol dad

according to the word on the streets
the votes were bought to insure the presidency lets see
the election was privatized co-operation control the votes right before your very eyes
reinforce the lie on cnn fox 9 live at 5 at 5

as far as the public domain
national elections have been takin
out of the public brain the publics insane
the facts still remain the same

the bushes are dumber and dumber
7 take away 1 in the brain number and number
they capitalize off the fear of the people
hip hop in the head of the people lethal

yall dont know yall dont know
what you talkin bout
yall dont know yall dont know
so what you saying
come on come on

like the chickens coming home to roost
its not a question of why
but what party you choose

liars that lie like the lies they tell them
heres all the news thats fit to print
from the mind of a pro black militant uh

yall dont know yall dont know
bio micro chips in the arms of pimps
snitches aint shit along with the trick
the shady buchanan get the dictionary

its very necessary that tom got me out on the ridge
homeless with nowhere to live they fig
they called me the last n-i-g
so i brought the noise and still lived

the beast restored a puppet regime population

im saying we went from gods to niggas

who in the hell told you that you were in heaven
who in the hell told you that you were in heaven
platinum gold a house and a car
but poverty all around you by far
people living under bridges or in a car
heaven for the super rich who call it modern living
but the man from the east calls it a wilderness
cause heaven for whites is hell for blacks in america
heaven and hell are two conditions of life
not a place up there or a place down there
its a condition of life on earth so value life
heaven is not things
its a higher level of thinking
and at the moment one may change the conditions of life
our people think a job partying and endless flow of women and moet
krystal and how much sex you can have is heaven
sometimes you got to think that it may not be heaven all the time
but being able to meet lifes struggles head on head on head on
without compromising your soul soul soul soul
in this worlds life
not life after death
life on earth
life
not worrying about how you are gonna eat or put clothes on your children
sit yourself in heaven at once
a woman is a very important part of heaven
she produces heaven with you
and if she is connected to the source of life
so heaven is a condition of life
and you can have it on earth
so value life
value life
who in the hell told yall you were in heaven
oh oh
lord have mercypeople are dying
they dont have homes
they dont have jobs
the city of new orleans will never be the same

loved rap til the companies ripped it up
now the soul is set weve been had like jazz
if you down for change then they take your voice away
and then they tell you the best is white
co-signed by a nigga that pimped the mic
make the rule the view that the beef is cool
but what it do is fool the few fools who buy the feud
keep the people all blind and dumb dancin
never let a record that wreck become rampant
see the street copycat the crap rap and songs
not knowin theres a poison goin on
til the message revealed and i show
but you never get to hear it on the radio
jack be nimble jack be quick fuck jack
bust that squeeze rewind the shit cmon

while i get my clap on and turn snitches lights out 

i tried to be nice now we gon have to bleed em

so right now is the time and your turfs the location

we bumpin hardcore heavyweight b-boy blast
on the street they hear my beat my 69 is fast

some reporter wanna holla and i said it was cool
wanna know about the album and the enemys new
how pe and guerilla funk is keepin it movin
breakin bread talkin politics you know how it go
bout the war and how its shitty that we murder for dough
then the reporter asked a question that i had to mash
how i would act if every day was maybe my last
how if every day i worried bout my family in this
id be murdered on these street in a puddle of piss
or if i would get some news that my brother had died
if they ran up in my house and held my kids and my wife
or if we was looted and somebody took all our thangs
if my sister was abducted never heard from again
i began to compare it so he could observe
when i made the parallels with how they livin abroad
i cant ignore it these pigs ride deep in the streets
cap a nigga for his wallet beat another for free
and the cold part about it life is cheaper than that
down there people on the bottom kill each other for scraps
imagine that propoganda got the people confused
damned by the media that keep em subdued
i been around the world seen a lot of shit in my life
same sirens same ghetto birds swirlin at night
same racism profilin each of us all
same outsiders where we live enforcin the law
gats clappin on the streets gunplayin with heat
same prisons full of brothers herded in like sheep
same turncoats thatll burn folks for pay
same conditions in communities we die everyday
same brutality and ignorance now what will it take
to break the motherfuckin cycle get the people away
thats why im fresh out of tears for em all out of tears for em
even though my heart goes out what the fuck you cryin bout
money for rebuilding but what about home
when the way we live is shitty wheres the love for our own
i cant decide it its real i hit you with proof
maybe ill be suicided cause i hit you with truth

get yo vest on we rain on babylon
the anti-fox news anti-pop original group
p and the enemy policin the beast
until we rise itll never be peace i put that on jesus
back with vocals no whack shit no glory focus
no gimmick tracks just hard truth and rough raps
plus that gear that keep em fearin the crime
makin sure brothers knowin the time thats why it aint no smilin
see the army as theyre snatchin us up yeah
at yo high school promisin what
better recognize the bling of the murder machine
thats why its meaning in the words when we serve and ask you to think
who the whores that embed with the swords
who the ones pimp us all sellin death for murder dog
the imagery is dead-ly so what the fuck
interscope ah better hope we never knowin and bringin the ruckus
like nas said its a coon parade yeah

soul survivors now tell me who can bring it liver
its pe still beatin the beast
in this game of latecomers fake friends and flakes
and grown men actin like teenagers we raisin the stakes
whatcha know about words i throw around
when i say it loud better know that im black and im proud
+this is what i mean an anti-nigger machine+
take a look around and see the way they keepin the realest from reachin
but i bet you never hear it again naw
clear channel never heat it again
it never fit into the corporate plan of attack
they genocidal practices only givin us murder on wax
keep us terrified music sterilized
back the lies of the homicide and smile while
life imitates what we make; they all
makin money off the africans fall thats why im callin out

chorus

paris
because a +nation of millions+ is fearin the +black+
when we +bumrush the show+ +the enemy strike back+
with mo game than the music and our message attract
+revolverlution+ and +rebirth+ll keep the music in tact
fuck that bust back on they criminal ways
no compassion in they action for the son of a slave
now the church used to hurt us make somebody behave
like this devil up in office really worship and pray
like god speak to him and he does what he wants
but you know they steal the vote if anybody gets smart
the real sin is the dilemma when the people support
the death penalty but call abortion murder for sport
for the fake patri-ot aint no questions asked
specially when the babies kill each other for gas
known to blast on a menace that dont even exist
set up puppet governments for the rich to get richer
more money for them hoods but the hoods in pain
when the schools close cause they say no money remain
still undereducated makin minimum wage
got your wal*mart makin new century slaves
whos crazy i can see through the disguise
see through the medias propaganda and lies
see a nation full of sheep still simple and blind
so we burn em with the sermon thats designed with a rhyme we do it

they make me sick - id like those to go away
been saving up my money for this

chuck d
what if she tried to get her face erased like it was commonplace
maybe just crazy because the doctor said she could
with new hips and tits maybe fuller lips
all it take a day and some pay for the tuck and nip
call the hoover remover by the time they was through-ah
her whole body would look the way she thought it should
they shake a splatter of fat and move from this to that
like frankenstein but blind because its in her mind
dont know what she felt or why she hated herself
maybe dolls and shows or maybe videos
now its plain to see the girl loves tv
because shes chasin a dream we know can never be
was all part of the plan to keep her lookin right
thinkin she could be janet if she took the knife
its not a sin to be thin she tryin hard to fit in
knowin soon shell be a citizen of the plastic nation

chorus 2x conversation between women and plastic surgeon
tell me what you dont like about yourself
i wanna change my face and i wanna change my body i wanna change my body
tell me what you dont like about yourself
i wanna change my face it would be so great

chuck d
now she was more crazy than lazy til she had a baby
tryin to move and improve upon on what god gave her
just like the swan she thought she had it goin on
but never once thought it was wrong or that it wouldnt save her
went to the clinic was in it for over half a day
as they sliced and diced and put the parts in place
her bodys bruised abused cause her minds confused
bent on livin a lie but never satisfied
and you know it aint right thats somebodys daughter
now her face is so tight that you can bounce a quarter
and the feeling aint back they said itll never be back
shes a creature with features broken out of order
thats why we try to find a way to get inside
and make you love your life and never need the knife
its not a sin to be thin dont need to bleed to fit in
now shes another citizen of the plastic nation

chorus

women talking to end
i need liposuction
id like bigger calves
i need liposuction
and id also like to go up to a c cup
tell me what you dont like about yourself
maybe i could have her ears
maybe i could have her ears and i like her nose
tell me what you dont like about yourself
because they dont stick out like ours does see
{*suction sounds*}intro/chorus paris
is it a coincidence that we aint taught truth
a coincidence that they target the youth
a coincidence everything is the same
that a message in the music aint a part of the game
a coincidence that we livin a lie
a coincidence that we only get by
a coincidence that so many are lost
and do prison time fore we notice the cost

paris
it really aint difficult to break the mold
and take a close look at the lies were told
wipe away the facade see we got to know
see the plot to control and to rot the soul
you can make anybody that dont read believe
anything that they see on the tv screen
that a lie is reality the sky is green
that theres weapons in iraq and the presidents clean
when its on thinkin you can trust police
every black is a beast and our women are cheap
and that brothers gettin murdered is the way of the streets
that its normal to die when we still in our teens
and thats the way it is whats the use to try
that school is a motherfuckin waste of time
slang yay die young maybe get rich rhymin
and prison if you black is just a part of life
and that all of america support the pres
religion is the way and we all full of sin
that its better after death if we suffer and pray
even though they fuck us off in this life today
and that white jesus hangin on the wall in church
aint a part of a lie to keep a brother subservient
and that the whole world need the word amen
got troops overseas gettin murdered for free
if you buy that shit i got a bridge to sell
like i said im a rebel so i must re-bel
and lies be the truth now war is peace
like corporations dont dictate the streets
like brothers dont die for the diamond or bling
like brothers dont die over songs we sing
like patri-ots act like the patriot act
while we swing on this bitch til we break it in half

chorus

paris
you guilty if arrested and niggaz are thugs
only good for welfare murder and drugs
the media is true with no bias at all
and fox news aint on the presidents balls
that lacey and oj and kobe and mike
aint bullshit and really do matter in life
that you shouldnt be insulted they give em the time
but never talk about all this corporate crime
that they generatin news stay loose with facts
relate fake views thatll keep us attracted
like sheep so we dont think never react
never question authority never suspect
never trip off of why what matters to us
always seem unimportant and never get love
why its never any money for the school support
but its fallin out the sky for these corporate wars

chorus

paris
they never give real shit space to shine
just donkey-ass niggaz on assembly line
cookie cutter pop-slutter make music designed
to pedal coca-cola motorola and sprite
no love for the enemy with video play
but they give flav a show to take the focus away
from the realest group ever made whaddya say
when to them its eminem thats goin down as the greatest
when the plan is a shame like we makin a choice
understand its a scam who get handed a voice
and its only a few and they decide in advance
like votin for the president and both of them fam
all that god bless america and nobody else
but i can smell racism however its dealt
know the real shit never miss see how its felt
all around the world hear the people cryin for help

chorus

outro paris
a coincidence ex-cons cant vote
a coincidence they cant get no work
a coincidence that they cant hold heat
now they know that they enemy dont look like me
a coincidence that we shit out of luck
the consequence of coincidences all add up
when you never know the reason and youre set up to suffer
the offense is coincidence is never the causechuck d + flavor flav
i came from a place i forgot
i woke up in the parking lot far from a meal and a cot
on the corner where all the streets got the same name
maybe my brains on the brink of insane
pain between the papers while sleepin on the train
this the land of milk and honey know what im sayin
the invisible man times three
black down and out - out standin on a corner no doubt
now a nation of homeless sleepin in bus stations
another win for the pilgrims who said no more haitians
as i proceed someone to feed me is what i need
three blocks of dealers tryin to hit me off with some weed
yeah avenues and boulevards hungry as a fucker
hope to get a ride from a trucker - aiyyo man
everybody know i aint no sucker
every time i used to drop thirty at the rucker - thats it
away from the crazy kids in generation wrecked
dissin pyramids while praisin projects
walk past old folks gettin no respect
callin young folks a bunch a no-good rejects
and i walk on

chorus chuck d
an eye for an eye i cant recognize the man in the mirror
is it i it is i
now who this cat im lookin at

and who this cat im lookin at
cause ive been lost so long without anybody knowin

chuck d + flavor flav
so i move on uh-huh and i walk on yeah-yeah
past the preachers and the pimps gettin their talk on say word
why do home gotta be where the negative roam
to be or not to be so i roll alone
im trapped within this skin and these bones
amongst temporary kings on cellular phones
can i last as i walk past
mad cigarette billboards and malt liquor ads
walkin on da bottles and potato chip bags
everyone i see got the nerve to brag
where they from what they got and dont own squat
disrespect where they from and you might get shot {*click click boom*}
zombies askin me what the latest bomb be
you shoulda shot the fuckin sheriff and the fuckin deputy g
for okayin the drug trade and lettin it be
but i know prison for me is an industry
so i walk heard the best things in life be free
didnt god make this land and the air that we breathe
not for the homeless dont give a damn about me
in the mirror somebody else is starin at me
maybe prison is the skin im within
all this time i been sufferin cant fix it with a bufferin
plus they said ill never work in this town again god damn 
so i keep on walkin - yeah

chorus

chuck d + flavor flav
lil dayday is big day and just did time
seen him standin on the unemployment line
which collided with the line of the health clinic
i seen crazy stacy her ass standin up in it
no more welfare they cut her medicaid
damn my momma used to do her braids
i keep walkin so they dont see me
but i doubt if they doin much better than me
so i walk on never take the planet for granted
i paved the concrete asphalt and granite
i walked past three brothers sittin on the porch
with a yard of dirt and littered with newports
talkin how they comin up while they sittin on they ass
as i walk past em im the target of they laughs
and one said lets get him for his fuckin stash
as i walked fast past the other yards with grass
had a little cash i tried to make it last
from a few deals i made from cleanin windshields
i ran like a rally they caught me in the alley
cant get out the ghetto from new york to cali
i thought i had nothin til i felt the knife
and now i aint even got a life {*echoes*}take it back to the days when we raised us up
fore coward-ass rap made the game corrupt
p-dog in the cut back to bring the pain
puttin wood on they ass cant stand the rain
and bring heat over beats and scratch the itch
in a no spin-zone fuck a scanadalous bitch
its the return of the bush killa back to bust
just us for the justice in god we trust
i rush truth to the youth - and shine the light
take the red pill open up ya eyes to life
in this land of these crack fiends sheep and moles
see us overthrow the hold of this devil control
and roll deep - keep it underground for the streets
im the last cell - hit em outta bounds retreat
we like ants in this war dance if one falls

but the vip section got your attention
and you cannot see that far past
wrong inspiration
for a young nation
when you dismiss education
and your living rooms a playstation
do your thing not the thing do you
dont fame gotta hold on you[verse 1]

welcome home to the terrordome
land of the forbidden
cause that man be sinnen
and his hand be hidden

with the glock to the wig
10 years since we lost pac and big

cause saving something aint worth sayin nothing

[verse 2]

genocide on us where
they practice this
thats why i pack the fifth

all them players rentin rims and hummers
got taught by a teacher defending columbus
new thug robbin ids and pin numbers
spot on my block
be hotter than 10 summers

stuck in last century like a fax machine
left back from the future
like some vaccine
from ghana botswana to watts and queens

and their dreams
dont get it twisted dont get it confused
the term snitch
revolutionaries use
when the government got the hood rhymin the blues
thats the term when the whole town lose

see something you better say something
cause saving something aint worth sayin nothing

[verse 3]

while some pass the criss
they happen to miss
the unexpected revolution
from some young catalyst
untouchable on the fbi list
not know knowin these facts is more hazardous
i rock intense
knock your block wit sense
welfare cut from them documents
masses volunteering for them chips
trace the hiv lane up that blood vessel
irs in that chest
you gotta wrestle
life is not a game

see the wicked run and try to hide the statistic
aint nuttin changed
pe be the same crew
it aint a game
once again gonna save you
dont get it twisted dont get it confused
the term snitch
revolutionaries use
when the government got the hood rhymin the blues
thats the term when the whole town lose

see something you better say something
cause saving something aint worth sayin nothingits been a long and whining road

especially with the impact of it takes a nation
of millions to hold us back
you bet theres blood on them bomb squad tracks
black steel baseheads party for your right to fight
prophets of rage bring the noise
dont believe the hype
cant do nuttin for you man
911 is a joke
20 years we got here by actin like common folk
touring the world like a rolling stone
then the nineties came
welcomed yall to the terrordome
some threw it away instead of something to say
cause the streets still ended up havin no names
since rebel without a pause beats were never the same
and by 1998 we still had game



only a pawn in the game
chastised for namin names
what was said and who said it
anti-nothing so forget it
tears of rage left a friend
blowin in the wind
but time is god
been back for 10 years and black again
some of them same cats
help usher in gangster rap
damn our interviews were better than a lotta them acts
praised the gangsta
just because it sold
while consciousness
went from platinum to gold
seen a nation reduce fight the power to gin and juice
some people gave it up and turned it loose


beethoven bach brahms
i want some james brown
even bruce brian bono beck yeah chuck berry
prince stevie sly smokey johnny cash in my chevy
heard some call me an uncle tom
now thats petty
im a songwriter fool
i condense sense from right and wrong
livin in the key of protest songs
from basement tapes
beyond them dollars and cents
changin of the guards spent
where the--went
most of their time out of mind
hatin my mess age rhymes
cant truss it shut em down call it whatcha wanna
but they made a day fit for a king
by the time we got to arizona

tommorrows a long time
we got god on our side
over bass and drum beats hear the good rhymes ride
a poison goin on
shelter from the storm
hard rain gonna fall
still the people rock onthe eastern world it is explodin
violence flarin and bullets loadin
youre old enough to kill but not for votin
and that jordan river has bodies floatin

but you tell me
over and over and over again my friend
you dont believe
were on the eve of destruction

dont you understand what im tryin to say
cant you feel the fears that im feelin today
if the button is pushed theres no runnin away
therell be no one to save with the world in a grave
take a look around ya boy its bound to scare ya boy

but you tell me
over and over and over again my friend
you dont believe
were on the eve of destruction

my bloods so mad it feels like coagulatin
im sitting here just contemplatin
you cant twist the truth it knows no regulation
and a handful of senators cant pass legislation
and marches alone cant bring integration
when human respect is disintegratin
now this whole crazy world is just too frustratin

but you tell me
over and over and over again my friend
you dont believe
were on the eve of destruction
[incomprehensible]

people i hate thats understood
it will make stuff hard to under
was feeling blooded to human race
if you win your war its the same old place

the poundin drums the pride and disgrace
you can bury your dead but dont leave a trace
hate your next-door neighbor but dont forget to say grace

but tell me
over and over and over again my friend
you dont believe
were on the eve of

but tell me
over and over and over again my friend
you dont believe
were on the eve of destruction

you dont believe

you dont believe
were on the eve of destruction
yeah you dont believe
were on the eve of destruction
