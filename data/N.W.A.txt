before my mom starts bitchin about my friends
bout to go and damn near went blind
young niggers on the path throwin up gang signs
i went in the house to get the clip
with my mack-10 on the side of my hip
i bailed outside and i pointed my weapon
just as i thought the fools kept steppin
i jumped in the front hit the juice on my ride
i got front and back side to side
then i let the alpine play
i was pumpin new shit by nwa
it was gangsta gangsta at the top of the list
then i played my own shit - it went somethin like this

cruisin down the street in my 6 4
jockin the bitches slappin the hos
went to the park to get the scoop
knuckleheads out there cold shootin some hoop

a car pulls up who can it be
a fresh el camino rollin key low-g
he rolls down the window and he starts to say
its all about makin that gta

cause the boyz in the hood are always hard
come talking that trash and well pull your card
know nothin in life but to be legit
dont quote me boy i aint said shit

bored as hell and i wanna get ill
so i go to a place where my homeboys chill
fellas out there tryin ta make that dolla
i pulled out there in my 6 4 impalla
greeted with a 40 and i start drinkin
and from the 8-ball my breath starts stinkin
i gotta get my girl to rock that body
before i left i hit the bacardi
pull to the house get her outta the path
the bitch said somethin ta make me mad
she said somethin that i couldnt believe
so i grabbed the stupid bitch by her nappy-ass weave
started talkin shit wouldnt you know
i reached back like a pimp
and i slapped the ho
when her father stood up and he started to shout
wo i threw a right cross and knocked his old ass out

cause the boyz in the hood are always hard
come talking that trash and well pull your card
know nothin in life but to be legit
dont quote me boy i aint said shitverse one eazy-e

hook a right turn and let the boys go past
then i say to myself they can kiss my ass

we can go toe to toe in the middle of a cell

with a little bit of gold and a pager
searchin my car lookin for the product
thinkin every nigger is sellin narcotics

youd rather see me in the pen

man fuck this shit
alright smart-ass im takin your black ass to jail

mc ren will you please give your testimony to the jury about this fucked up incident

mc ren
fuck the police and ren said it with authority
because the niggers on the street is a majority
a gang thats wit whoever im steppin
and a motherfuckin weapon is kept in

a stash box for the so called law
wishin ren was a nigger that they never saw
lights all flashin behind me
but theyre scared of a nigger so they mace to blind me

but that shit dont work i just laugh
because it gives em a hint not to step in my path
to police im sayin fuck you punk
readin my rights and shit its all junk

pullin out a silly club so you stand
with a fake-assed badge and a gun in your hand
but take off the gun so you can see whats up
and well go at it punk and ima fuck you up

make you think ima kick your ass
but drop your gat and rens gonna blast
im sneaky as fuck when it comes to crime
but ima smoke em now and not next time

smoke any motherfucker that sweats me
and any asshole that threatens me
im a sniper with a hell of a scope
takin out a cop or two that cant cope with me

the motherfuckin villain thats mad
with potential to get bad as fuck
so ima turn it around
put in my clip yo and this is the sound 

ak47 gunshots yeah somethin like that
but it all depends on the size of the gat
takin out a police would make my day
but a nigger like ren dont give a fuck to say

scene ii
yo man whatcha need
police open now oh shit we have a warrant for eazy-es arrest

eazy e wont you step up to the stand and tell the jury how you feel about this bullshit

eazy-e
im tired of the motherfuckin jackets
sweatin my gang while im chillin in the shack an
shinin the light in my face and for what
maybe its because i kick so much butt

i kick ass or maybe its cause i blast
on a stupid-assed nigga when im playing with the trigger
of an uzi or an ak
cause the police always got somethin stupid to say

they put up my picture with silence
cause my identity by itself causes violence
the e with the criminal behavior
yeah im a gangster but still i got flavor

without a gun and a badge what do you got
a sucker in uniform waitin to get shot
by me or another nigger
and with a gat it dont matter if hes smaller or bigger

size dont mean shit hes from the old school fool
and as you all know es here to rule
whenever im rollin keep lookin in the mirror
and ears on cue yo so i can hear a

dumb motherfucker with a gun
and if im rollin off the eight hell be the one
that i take out and then get away
while im driving off laughin this is what ill say

fuck tha police
fuck tha police
fuck tha police

you know why  because so many are relatin to this 
jealous is how they feel it intentionally 
but they start to love it becoz i made it eventually 
pumpin the music i keep the music like pumpin 
coz ren aint in here for nuthin i keep the average crowd jumpin 
yo you know the color the villains in black 
always down to make noise and attack 
so you better get back unless you wanna come with it 
and make your face like a target and close your eyes when i hit it 
youre screamin with fear but its with fear that youre screamin 
youre wakin up in a sweat coz ren is givin bad dreams and 
im not schemin im just tellin the facts 
thats how it is when nwa starts to jack 
so brothers that wanna scrap with me 
that sweezin and sneezin will have to lap with me 
especially beggin to write some lyrics with me 
i just snatch your girl to take a nap with me 
coz when it comes to ren theres no comparison 
and if you try to be me its quite embarassin 
but i understand coz youre mentally slow 
coz i can tell from the jump youre too nervous to go 

if it aint ruff it aint me scratch 
[tha gangstas black and hes about to attack] 
if it aint ruff it aint me scratch 
lemme bust a freestyle here [allright then] 

i can tell that youre afraid to fight me 
simple because you lost the crowd and they had to invite me 
becoz youre sweat as a puddle but theres a puddle o sweat 
im a threath so get a cold rag and wipe your neck 
and clean the dirt off your face that calls acne 
its ridiculous thinkin that you can jack me 
this is the round where the punch will go 
until ya a g-a-t thats known as a flow 
im makin a point but its a point that im makin 
like see im hatin the fakin i keep the suckers like shakin 
scared to speak with a tongue and theyre chozen 
the sound of my voice in their ear and theyre frozen 
this is a battle to the death its like the [ same ol ] 
against a brother on a tip with [] 
givin a pain but its with pain that im givin 
but im comparin and tearinem but im makin a livin 
with the hype of a 9 volt battery 
and the odds for me to conquer is averagely good 
meanin im a flow 
im from the streets so yo im ready to go 

if it aint ruff it aint me [yo ren] 
[tha gangstas black and hes about to attack] 
if it aint ruff it aint me 
[man whatcha gonna do now ] [get funky] 

the do not disturb sign is in effect 
while im thinkin of a fool to select 
to give the victim the verdict so for the verdict a victim 
slammin my vocals on a dance with the rest then i kick them 
tellem theyre guilty and beep out the bailer 
and get a new track o drums so i can play with 
percussion; pumpin it loud when i perform 
yo you wanna play in my game put on a uniform 
it aint a rule in the book you have to go by 
hey coz when it comes to cheatin yo you should know i 
for fear in the hearts coz its the hearts full of fear 
coz what you hear in your ear is something funky and clear 
the hump was incredible yo but ren he was super 
but now im ruthless a civilian and not a trooper 
but a soldier with a top rankin 
givin dope material the hell with the gankin 
so play like an airplane and just jet 
and keep your blood pressure low coz im a [] if not 
im afraid of the show 
that youre a sucker and youre too nervous to go 

if it aint ruff it aint me [yo ren] 
[the gangstas black and hes about to attack] 
if it aint ruff it aint me [yo ren] 
[the gangstas black] if it aint  if it aint 
scratching[dr dre]
one two three kick it

[the doc]
aiyyo dre whats goin on man whats goin on
ay what chall gonna do for this last record
nah tell me what chaall gonna do
okay you want me to do the intro aight

parental discretion is advised for the moment
while im getting candid now understand it
aint too typical in any way though the pro
on the mic is the do to the c this is an intro
i know the doc makes you want to take a valium
so buy a bucket cause upcomin is my album
and for the record meanin my record check it
listen to the single and youll be like yo i gotta get it
but in the meantime listen to the rhyme
of the dr dre played wit nwa
yellas on the drum roll rockin the beat
aiyyo dre wherere you gonna take this shit man

[dr dre]
aiyyo lets take it to the street word up let em understand perfection
let knowledge be the tool for suckers to stop guessin
cause i dont give a fuck about a radio play
observed the english i display
lyrics for the adults children have been barred
and scarred from listenin to somethin so motherfuckin hard
dope pumpin thats so my shit will never falter
yo its dre so fuck the mind of minolta
psycho like no other motherfucker
so step to me wrong g-o for what you n-o
but be warned never will i leave like a regular
cause im a little better than the regular competitor
i use to see em on stage
earnin money like a thief but without a gauge
until i got full of clockin the lame gettin pull
they said you wasnt gon get paid nah thats bullshit
they like it stylistic
and i enchant the crowd like im a mystic
c-c-c-c c-c-c-cameras are flashin when im in action
a photo or fresh with a flair for fashion
pure simplicity see its elementary
you hear one of the hardest motherfuckers this century
try to comprise a word to the wise and the guys
parental discretion is advised

[mc ren]
ren is most extremely high performance
the black hat cause i worn this cause its like enormous
some shit i dont take it not even in a toilet
and shit from a sucker put in a pot and ill boil it
turn up the pilot as it burns
and maybe the motherfuckers will learn
im not a sub cause i speak sensible
not considered a prince cause im a principal
im engineerin the shit that youre hearin
cause when it comes to power im power steerin
silly you say i say youre silly when you say it
rushin to the eject to put my shit in and play it
its like apollo but im not an amateur
and im not givin a fuck while im damagin ya
its for the record so rens lyrics is gonna spin it
and if there was a trophy involved ill win it
possession is mine and im the holder
cause a nigga like ren dont give a fuck cause im older
so for you to step off would be wise
and say fuck it parental discretion is advised

[ice cube]
i be what is known as a bandit
you gotta hand it to me when you truly understand it
cause if you fail to see read it in braile
itll still be funky - so whats next is the flex
of a genius my rapid-stutter-steppin if you seen this
dope you hope that i dont really mean this
but if played made the grade or high-top fade
its not my trademark when i get loose in the dark
you guess it was a test of a different style
its just another motherfucker on the pile
drivin your ass with the flow of your tongue
you hung yourself short the after-knowledge was brung
to your attention by the hardest motherfuckin artist
that is know for lynchin any sucker in a minute
stagger em all
when i start flowin like niagara falls
ice cube is equipped to rip shit in a battle
move like a snake when im mad and then my tail rattle
i get low on the flow so let your kids know
when i bust parental discretion is a must

[eazy-e]
little did they know that i would be arrivin
and its surprisin rockin it from where i been
but its the e here to take no mistake to be made
in the trade where funky ass records are bein played
fuck the regular yo as i get better the
bitches wanna trick and go stupid up on the dick
so i get em hot thinkin theyre gonna get it
as they sit rubbin their legs like a cricket
to you it may be funny but
theres no service of beef without money
so slip the c-note and you can choke
on a wing-ding-ding-a-ling down your throat
foreplay to me aint shit
when you spread em im ready then you can get the dick
of the eaze if you can deal with the size
but if you cant parental discretions advised

[unknown voice at the end after band breaks down]

[ren]
back by demand now its big as f**k
because you as the public you should know whats up
comptons in the house was more than gold it was a hit
cause it was based on some crazy shit
so our final conclusion has been permitted
punks made us a target and knew that wed hit it
but that was a part of showbizz
[dre]
hey yo homeboy why dont you tellem what your name is 
[ren]
well for the record its ren and for the street its villain
and strapped with a gat its more like matt dillon
on gunsmoke but not a man of the law
im just the baddest motherf**ker that you ever saw
see i peep and then i creep on a fool
get my bloodpressure high but still stay cool
dig a grave of a nigga lookin up to me
that really had the nerve that he could f**k with me
who was the man in the mass while i was waitin to axe 
you know its mc ren kickin mucho ass

hey yo homeboy [dre whassup ] why dont you tellem what yo name is

so now lets get the motherf**kin session 
goin flowin its time to start throwin
rhymes so keep in mind all the suckers im blowin
cause im a start showin the time
never sayin im the best and just goin for mine
unlike a lotta suckers who claim theyre gettin busy
when their records only make good frisbees
you need to stop runnin off the mouth
stop and think before you put some whack bullshit out


its not difficult in fact its kinda simple
to create something funky thats original
you need to talk about the place to be
who you are what you got about a suck mc

[dre] oh yeah thats what im talkin about ren
you know what im sayin 
[ren] yeah i know what youre sayin dre but you
still aint toldem enough man
[dre] allright allright
well lets kick one more verse right here allright
kick it

[dre]+[ren]
this is portable something to f**k with yo ear
ren and dre will appear when the sound is clear
to f**k it up like we always do and thats the trick
sayin some shit to make the bitches wanna suck our dicks
but its an everyday thang
communicating to yall with the compton slang
comptons back in the house and your appartment
so open your door by the way so we can start it
test the monitors and call this mic
cause the way we feel were gonna f**k it up tonight
i got my mic in my hand with a hell of a grip
bitches screamin and shit now its a trip
waitin for the grand finale or the end
or stupid rhymes set be dre and ren
well like a kid we get new shoes and go faster
smilin like hell as we move past the
suckers the motherf**kers with the ego hype
cause were positive and theyre on a negative type
and if think were about to quit
motherf**ker you aint heard shit

[dre] yeah that shit was funky you know what im sayin ren 
[ren] i know what youre sayin this is mc ren and drdre
cold kickin it in the place
[dre] ah yeah my mellow eazy e in the house
yella boy in the house
my boy ice cube
arabian prince cold rockin shit
[ren] oh yeah hey im a say whassup to my homeboys from cnw
[dre] yeah hey yo ren whatta we gonna call this shit 
tellem what yo name is 
[ren] yeah something like thatyo man theres a lot of brothers out there
flakin and perpetratin who scared to kick reality
yo dre you been doin all this dope producin
you aint had a chance to show em what time it is
so watchu want me to do

im expressin with my full capabilities
and now im livin in correctional facilities
cause some dont agree wit how i do this
i get straight and meditate like a buddhist
im droppin flavour my behavior is hereditary
but my technique is very necessary
blame it on ice cube because he said it get funky
when you got a subject and a predicate
add it on a dope beat and itll make ya think
some suckers just tickle me pink to my stomach
cause they dont flow like this one
you know what i wont hesitate to diss one or two before im through
so dont try to sing this
some drop science well im droppin english
even if yella makes it a cappella
i still express yo i dont smoke weed or sess
cause its known to give a brother brain damage
and brain damage on the mic dont manage nuttin
but makin a sucker and you equal
dont be another sequel

express yourself
do it do
express yourself
oh do it

ice cube is not for the pop charts
so where should a brother like you start expressin yourself
my boyll show you how yo dre
watup
drop english right about now
gettin back to the pg
thats program and its easy
dre is back new jacks are made hollow
expressin niggers subject because they like to follow the words
the style the trend the records i spin
again and again and again
yo yall on the other end
watch a brother bringin dope rhymes with no help
theres no fessin or guessin when im expressin myself
its crazy to see people be what society wants em to be
but not me 
ruthless is the way togo they know
others say rhymes that fail to be original
or they kill where the hip-hop starts
forget about the ghetto and rap for the pop charts
and those musicians that cuss at home
but scared to use profanity when up on the microphone
yeh they want reality but chu wont hear none
they rather exaggerate a little fiction
some say no to drugs and take a stand
but after the show they go lookin for the dopeman
oh they ban my group from the radio here nwa
they say hell no
but chu know it aint all about wealth
as long as you make a note to express yourself

express yourself
do it do
express yourself
oh do it

a lyricist yo dre is the name for it
to make somethin dope on a record thats what he came for
kickin reality over stand us up
but its important to keep it in mind to express yourself
from the heart if you wanna start and move up the chart then 
expression is big part of it
you aint efficient when you flow you aint swift
movin like a tortise full o rigor mortis
theres a little bit more to show
i got rhymes in my mind embedded like a embryo
a lesson all bout expression
and if you start fessin i got a smith n weston for ya
i might ignore youre record because it has no bottom
i get loose in the summer winter spring and autumn
its dre on the mic gettin physical
doin the job nwa is the lynch mob
yes im macabre but chu know you need this
and the night i just gone just like a fetus
or tumor heres the rumour dres in the neighbourhood and hes up to no good
when i start expressin myself yella slam me
cause if i stay funky like dis im doin damage
or ima be too hype and need a straightjacket
i got knowledge and other suckers lack it
so when you see dre a dj on the mic
ask what its like its like we gettin hype tonight
cause if i strike it aint for your good health
but i wont strike if you just express yourself

express yourself
do it do
express yourself
oh do itah yeah right about now comptons in de mothafuckin house [yeah do it do it]

im at a show then my picture is takin
one click of the flash and punk niggaz are breakin
to the door tryin to join my fan club
lipstickin over one of my dubs
and its the minimal scratch for the moment
until i fuck up the so called opponet
thats standing in the zone of the twilight
sayin how in de fuck did he get mixed up in my fight
it wasnt a mistake it was a set-up
so until im finished poppin my lyrics you should shut up
and dont attempt to speak
because its bad enough you rollin up shit quick
with a nigga like ren about the hit
now lemme hear you mothafuckaz talk some more shit
im a bust your ass in your mouth

[dr dre]

or scarier scaffle
i just muffle the opposition theres no competition
let em know that dre is gettin stronger
comptons in de house but now its some longer

comptons in the house

you stupid mothafuckaz

comptons in the house intro girl ice cube

ice cube do you think you could give me some money to get
my hair done how shorts your hair right now
well you know i get it done every week and i need my nails
done too look ima tell you like this

verse one

i aint the one the one to get played like a pooh butt
see im from the street so i know whats up
on these silly games thats played by the women
im only happy when im goin up in em
but you know im a menace to society
but girls in biker shorts are so fly to me
so i step to em with aggression
listen to the kid and learn a lesson today
see they think we narrow minded
cause they got a cute face and big-behinded
so i walk over and say how ya doin
see im only down for screwin but you know
ya gotta play it off cool
cause if they catch you slippin youll get schooled
and theyll get you for your money son
next thing you know youre gettin their hair and they nails done
fool and theyll let you show em off
but when it comes to sex they got a bad cough
or a headache its all give and no take
run out of money and watch your heart break
theyll drop you like a bad habit
cause a brother with money yo they gotta have it
messin with me though they gets none
you cant juice ice cube girl cause i aint the one

interlude one

girrrrrl you got to get these brothers for all the money
you can honey  cause if they aint got no money they cant
do nothin for me but get out of my face

i know what you mean girl it aint nothin right jumpin off
unless he got dollars

verse two

sometimes i used to wonder
how the hell an ugly dude get a fine girls number
hes gettin juiced for his ducats
i tell a girl in a minute yo i drive a bucket
and wont think nuttin of it
she can ride or walk either leave it or love it
i show her that im not the o the n-e say
im a ruthless n-i double-g a
cause im gamin on a female thats gamin on me
you know i spell girl with a b
a brother like me is only out for one thing
i think with my ding-a-ling but i wont bring no
flowers to your doorstep when we goin out
cause youll take it for granted no doubt
and after the date ima want to do the wild thing
you want lobster huh  im thinking burger king
and when i take you you get frustrated
you cant juice ice cube and you hate it
but you see i dont go nuts
over girls like you with the big ol butts
it start comin out the pocket to knock it
but when the damage is done
you can only lay me girl you cant play me girl
for the simple fact that i aint the one

interlude two

i dont care how they look if they got money
we can hook up but they aint gettin none

yeah i just make em think they gonna get some
play up they mind a lil bit and get that money

oh ice cube can i have some money pleeeease

verse three

give you money why bother
cause you know im lookin nothin like your father
girl i cant be played or ganked
ganked means getting took for your bank
or your gold or your money or something
nine times outta ten shes giving up nothing
they get mad when i put it in perspective
but lets see if my knowledge is effective
to the brothas man they robbing you blind
cause they fine with a big behind but pay it no mind
keep your money to yourself homie
and if you got enough game
youll get her name and her number
without going under
you cant leave em and love and stay above em
i used to get no play now she stay behind me
cause i said i had a benz 190
but i lied and played the one
just to get some now she feels dumb
to my homies its funny
but thats what you get trying to play me for my money
now dont you feel used
but i dont give hoot huh because i knock boots
you shouldnt be so damn material
and try to milk ice cube like cereal
now how many times do i have to say it
cause if i have to go get a gun
you girls will learn i dont burn
you think im a sucka but i aint the one

outro

but you said you love me

eazy e take one mc ren yo hit it

mc ren
ruthless plenty of that and much more
so at the party ren is controllin the floor
that you step and do your danceroutine
it aint a dream my man youre in a gangsta scene
with a villain doin damage on a 24 track
with confusion to finish my conclusion
arhytomatic rhymes from a radio cat
you cant take what i got coz ill be takin it right back
ruthless gangsta cold killin
you wanna know what its means  definitionvillain
with the stupid dope rhyme
so once you hear one line you can tell its mine
with a baseball cap thats black that im wearin
and a look that keeps you all starin
and wondering why im invincible
but when you hear my rhyme its convincible
i dont take no shorts while im constructin the ground
that makes yall move around to my hell of a sound
girls drool on me like a dyin
drdre yo ren tellem what they do when you start rhymin
i go to the party i hip a hop the spot
i dunno what it is but the girls get hot
aspirin like theyre on fire and
their so-called boyfriends withem are retirin
and for this reason im a walkin threath
so when im on stage i wantssssht

eazy e quiet on tha set
light camera action
eazy e nwa take two

mc ren
now to get started with my musical profession
a gangsta or villain in mine is in session
the way that im referrin to this makes ya move ya butt
but dont stand in a daze yeah you should know whats up
anyway i keep the clappin along
coz nothing bad could go wrong because this song is so strong
 huh  im  who could ask for anything more 
when nwa is cold rockin the floor
like stupid actin like a retard
waitin for a bumrush gettin to the good part
it tips me so with temptation
writin my lyrics with this hyped information
just look at the center of the stage where the spotlight shines 
eazy e boy you should have known by now its mine 
unpredictable keepin you extremely enjoyed


its irresistable meanin that you cant avoid
and while im on stage look forward to sweat
but after i rip it up i wantssssht

eazy e quiet on tha set
light camera action
eazy e nwa take three

mc ren
i can be loud as hell think i will  never
ssssht eazy e quiet on tha set yeah i like that better
 huh  as what i can do  i think i earn respect
and if i didnt from you thats what i expect
coz if it aint ruff it aint me
so who really cares how you want me to be
see im just me standin at the top of the pile
and doin soft known tunes it aint my style
and this concludes our program
of how nwa makes a ruthless jam
now first we take an average drum
give it to dre and the boy gets dumb
its no secret that i sit alone at night
pick up a pad and pen and begin to write
all kinda lyrics thats promised to play
to make everybody say
they can be cold and ruthless no question about that
but sometimes its more complicated
eazy e yo dre you know what i want you to do 
public enemy bring that beat back bring that beat back

now mc ren is here workin like super glue
no matter what i do im always thinkin o you
coz im the pusher supplyin the fix
and this jams so dope it dont need a remix
but im makin obstacles of enemy traps
to catch any mcs with the weak-ass raps
crucifyin their  huh  like just for usin my name
the definition is pain but thats the thing o the game
if they try to retreat i catchem one at a time
coz theyre comittin a crime and still promotin a rhyme
so youre in the back of me just listen and learn
because youll all get a chance or maybe a turn
now my sideman wants to give a preview
so at my next concert i wanna see you
there not sittin in a chair
standin on yo feet with yo hand in the air
now im about to get out but ill be back
but next time expect the more funkier track
deep down for your enjoyment to hear more percussion
with lyrics thats smooth to start some discussion
the beat that im  hype  and you know thats bad
now continue to dance coz im thru with tha setyo give me somethin to dance to

calling the police calling the g-men
calling all americans

arabian prince back wit a style thats hype
not slow and low its the fast type
gettin dumped can you hear the drums
yo dre why dont you pump it up some
i pumped it up so now whats up
yo yella boy add a little cut
what the hell you think we need some bells
yeah homeboy might as well
there it is so now whats next
a little ssssssssssss
so find me a ho wait a minute
you need somethin else then
this is what i want you to do
feel the groove bust a move


yo im tired what about you
man this is somethin to dance to

man thats wack everybody used that
yo why dont you bring back the other track
yeah there you go thats what im sayin
i like it when that dope stuffs playin
real loud in ya ear hole
man lets go i think my feet are swoll from dancin so damn much
maaaaaan i dont give a what
you wanna leave with all these females pullin on my sleeve
i bet you can jet homeboy no sweat
this is what i want you to do
feel the groove bust a move
this is somethin to dance to

let the bass kick
th-th-this is somethin ta dance tox7yo man theres a lot of brothers out there
flakin and perpetratin who scared to kick reality
yo dre you been doin all this dope producin
you aint had a chance to show em what time it is
so watchu want me to do

all you got to do now express yourself
i expressin with my full capabilities
and now im livin in correctional facilities
cause some dont agree wit how i do this
i get straight and meditate like a buddhist
im droppin flavour my behavior is hereditary
but my technique is very necessary
blame it on ice cube because he said it get funky
when you got a subject and a predicate
add it on a dope beat and itll make ya think
some suckers just tickle me pink to my stomach
cause they dont flow like this one
you know what i wont hesitate to diss one or two before im through
so dont try to sing this
some drop science well im droppin english
even if yella makes it a cappella
i still express yo i dont smoke weed or cess
cause its known to give a brother brain damage
and brain damage on the mic dont manage nuttin
but makin a sucker and you equal
dont be another sequel

express yourself
do it do
express yourself
oh do it

ice cube is not for the pop charts
so where should a brother like you start expressin yourself
my boyll show you how yo dre
watup
drop english right about now
gettin back to the pg
thats program and its easy
dre is back new jacks are made hollow
expressin niggers subject because they like to follow the words
the style the trend the records i spin
again and again and again
yo yall on the other end
watch a brother bringin dope rhymes with no help
theres no fessin or guessin while im expressin myself
its crazy to see people be what society wants em to be
but not me
ruthless is the way to go they know
others say rhymes that fail to be original
or they kill where the hip-hop starts
forget about the ghetto and rap for the pop charts
and those musicians cuss at home
theyre scared to use profanity when up on the microphone
yeah they want reality but chu wont hear none
they rather exaggerate a little fiction
some say no to drugs and take a stand
but after the show they go lookin for the dopeman
oh they ban my group from the radio here nwa
they say hell no
but chu know it aint all about wealth
as long as you make a note to

express yourself
do it do
express yourself
oh do it

a lyricist yo dre is the name for it
to make somethin dope on a record thats what he came for
kickin reality over stand us up
but its important to keep it in mind to express yourself
from the heart if you wanna start and move up the chart then
expression is big part of it
you aint efficient when you flow you aint swift
movin like a tortise full o rigor mortis
theres a little bit more to show
i got rhymes in my mind embedded like a embryo
a lesson all bout expression
and if you start fessin i got a smith n weston for ya
i might ignore youre record because it has no bottom
i get loose in the summer winter spring and autumn
its dre on the mic gettin physical
doin the job nwa is the lynch mob
yes im macabre but chu know you need this
and the night i just gone just like a fetus
or tumor heres the rumour dres in the neighbourhood and hes up to no good
when i start expressin myself yella slam me
cause if i stay funky like dis im doin damage
or ima be too hype and need a straightjacket
i got knowledge and other suckers lack it
so when you see dre a dj on the mic
ask what its like its like we gettin hype tonight
cause if i strike it aint for your good health
but i wont strike if you just

express yourself
do it do
express yourself
oh do it 

express yourself
express yourself
express yourself
express yourself
express yourself
express yourself
oh do it

express yourselfdr dre

we havent spotted them yet 
but theyre somewhere in the immediate vicinity 

[mc ren] 
a 100 miles and runnin 
mc ren i hold the gun and 
you want me to kill a mutherfucker and its done in 
since im stereotyped to kill and destruct - 
is one of the main reasons i dont give a fuck 
chances are usually not good 
cause i freeze with my hands on a hot hood 
and gettin jacked by the you-know-who 
when in a black and white the capacity is two 
were not alone were three more brothers i mean street-brothers 
now wearin my dyes cause im not stupid mutherfuckers 
theyre out to take our heads for what we said in the past 
point blank - they can kizz my black azz 
i didnt stutter when i said fuck tha police 
cause its hard for a nigga to get peace 
now its broken and cant be fixed 
cause police and little black niggers dont mix so 
now im creepin through the fall 
runnin like a team well see i might have slayed yall 
so for now pack the gun and 
hold it in the air 
cause mc ren has a 100 miles of runnin 

into this news four fugitives are on the run 
fbi sources tell us that the four are headed 
100 miles to their homebase compton 

[eazy e] 
lend me a mutherfuckin ear 
so i can tell you why 

[dr dre] 
runnin with my brothers headed for the homebase 
with a steady pace on the face that just we raced 
the road ahead goes on and on 
the shit is gettin longer than the mutherfuckin marathon 
runnin on but never runnin out 
stayin wired and if i get tired i can still try out 
hitchhikin if thats what it gotta do 
but nobodys pickin up a nigga witta attitude 
confused 
yo but dres a nigga with nuthin to lose 
one of the few whos been accused and abused 
of the crime of poisonin young minds 
but you dont know shit til you been in my shoes 
and dre is back from the c-p-t 
droppin some shit thats d-o-p-e 
so fuck the p-o-l-i-c-e 
and any mutherfucker that disagrees 
stuck and runnin hard hauling ass 
cause im a nigga known for havin a notorious past 
my mind was slick - my temper was too quick 
now the fbis all over my dick 

[eazy e] 
got us tick and runnin just to find the gun that started the clock 
thats when the e jumped off the startin block 
a 100 miles from home and yo its a long stretch 
a little sprintin mutherfucker that they wont catch 
yeah back to compton again 
yo its either that or the federal pen 
cause niggas been runnin since beginning of time 
takin a minute to tell you whats on my mutherfuckin mind 
runnin like i just dont care 
comptons 50 miles but  yo imma get there 
archin my back and on a straight rough 
just like carl lewis im ballin the fuck out 
from city to city im a menace as i pass by 
rippin up shit just so you can remember im 
a straight up nigga thats done in gunnin and comin 
straight at yo ass 
a 100 miles and runnin 

interlude 

this one goes out to the four brothers from compton 
youre almost there but the fbi has a little message for you 
nowhere to run to baby nowhere to hide 
good luck brothers 

[mc ren] 
runnin like a nigga i hate to lose 
show me on the news but i hate to be abused 
i know it was a set-up 
so now im gonna get up 
even if the fbi wants me to shut up 
but ive got 10 000 niggas strong 
they got everybody singin my fuck tha police song 
and while they treat my group like dirt 
their whole fuckin family is wearin our t-shirts 
so imma run til i cant run no more 
cause its time for mc ren to settle the score 
i got a urge to kick down doors 
at my grave like a slave even if the ren calls 

[dr dre] 
clouds are dark and brothers are hidin 
dick-tricklin at the sunny mutherfuckers are ridin 
started with five and yo one couldnt take it 
so now theres four cause the fifth couldnt make it 
the numbers even - now im leavin 
were never gettin took by a bitch with a weave in 
her and the troops are right behind me 
but theyre so fuckin stupid theyll never find me 

[eazy e] 
one more mile to go through the dark streets 
runnin like a mutherfucker on my own two feet 
but you know i never stumble or lag last 
im almost home so i better haul ass 
tearin up everything in sight 
its a little crazy mutherfucker dodging the searchlight 
now that chase the shit is done and 
four mutherfuckers goin crazy with 
a 100 miles of runnin

it goes one for the treble two for the bass she got nut all over her face

slow is the tempo and ren is gonna flow
as i produce and illustrate you to a ho
cought on the late night stampin on the base-pipe
shes a hype to get you on the late flight
but back in school she was a cutie yo
then after graduation started givin up the booty
in school stuck her head in a feather
every time i asked her whats the time
it was never ever what she would talk to the ren im sayin
i wanted a date she wouldnt even be my friend
but now in the 1990s id be praying that the bitch dont find me
cause shes got a gang o kidz knuckle-heads and all dirty
and shes givin pimp by a nigga thats 30

chorus

she swallowed it [yeaahh]

at a high school dance -
me and the niggaz bailed in
i saw her sittin with her friends with the clan
so sexy thought she was all that
she wouldnt even look it up because we wore the black hat
she was a stuck-up bitch on the public floor
but an instant prostitute behind closed doorz
on the streets shes a late night feature
walkin home from school saw her suckin a niggaz dick another bleacher
she saw me and she ran and tried to hide her face
but a bitch full of nut couldnt escape in the chase
a disgrace if i ever ever saw her
there wasnt a nigga on the block
late at night not gettin done


so she begged me not to tell a soul
then i said of course cause my dick you its harder than a telepole
then again it dont concern me
cause theres a slight chance if i f**k she might burn me
and then i might have to shoot de ho
i mean checkin with de quickness just to let her know
but to prevent from gettin sick -
i would just prefer to let her come and suck my dick

chorus 
its the worlds biggest dick
dont matter just dont bite it
its the worlds biggest dick
dont matter just dont bite it
but does she suck a good dick
dont matter just dont bite it
she swallowed it [yeaahh]

now i was at a club on a late late sunday
peepin at the bitches till the next day monday
had a couple of drinks so i was feeling good
and suddenly i saw this bitch who lives in my neighborhood
she went to church every week so now i locked her
she was at the end of the bar gettin f**ked up
back at the house she was bitch n be ignorin                          
and when she start to talk the ho was kinda borin
yo but now i got to dawn see
now shes dancin on the floor with a skirt and no panties on
shakin that ass like a salt shaker
i already got my plans -
just while im a take her to a room
but yo i mean a rest room
and stick my dick in her mouth like a wet broom
so i grabbed her hand and shes with it
oh and when she turned sobber shouldnt have had admit it
so while shes dropped id better get it quick
and see for myself if she sucks a good dick 

chorus 
its the worlds biggest dick
dont matter just dont bite it
its the worlds biggest dick
dont matter just dont bite it
what do you want me to do with it
dont matter just dont bite it
lick de big dick baby i wanna f**k this one
its the worlds biggest dick
dont matter just dont bite it
its the worlds biggest dick
dont matter just dont bite it
but does she suck a good dick
dont matter just dont bite it
she swallowed it                          
so there you have it - a job well done but for now let me get back to what

verse one dr dre

f**k the motherf**king police
they dont want peace they want a nigga deceased
so hell cease to be a problem and by the way the perform
it seems the klan gave the white police another uniform
and yo the black police the house niggaz
they gave you a motherf**king gun so i guess you figure
you made out good to go but you didnt know
they would stick your black ass back in the ghetto yo
to kill another nigga catch him with crack in fact
freebase - they put in the neighborhood in the first place
but the brothers aint stupid remember that
you got a gat i got a gat so whassup with that

the last words you hear then the smoke appears
tears from your motherf**kin family
theyre starin at me but im goin gun happy f**k em
shootin everything in sight tonights the night to get hyped
and fight for whats wrong f**k whats right
and by the way my name is dre
so listen up motherf**ker to what i gotta say yo

chorus

f**k the police  f**k f**k f**k the police
f**k
f**k f**k f**k the police
[now for the first episode]

episode one

yeah that shits hittin man where the volume at
hold-up hold-up hold-up one-time one-time one-time
put the joint out  put the joint out
hey you motherf**kers want to step out of the car
dont you know its against the law to play music so god damn loud  shut 
the f**k up  go to jail  gimme that shit you was just smoking

motherf**kers from high crime areas view the police as a threat
and thats some shit you betta not forget

verse two eazy-e

eazy es the name feared by most
when a lil nigga is thrown in the pen
but on the streets theres two kinds of people
white rich f**ks and the ones who get harassed like me
pull over to the side routine for me
tearin up my shit like they lookin for a key of cocaine
but they never find the shit
aint got nuttin better to do and nobody else to f**k wit
thinkin everything is stolen
but cant face facts that a young black niggas just rollin
making more money than they ever make
taking more shit than they ever take
yo pigs are made to kill and no regret and
keep your hand on your weapon shoot his ass and start steppin
cause im a nigga that dont give a f**k about nothin
so let me explain a lil somethin yo

see i got this problem a big problem
cops dont like me so i dont like motherf**king cops


chorus

f**k the police  f**k f**k f**k the police
f**k
f**k f**k f**k the police
[f**k the police]

episode two

get out of the f**kin car
wait a god damn minute what the hell did i do
hey just shut the f**k up black bitch
wait a minute you aint gotta be pullin me by my motherf**kin hair  let 
go of my motherf**kin hair
hey just step the f**k back and shut up
get your motherf**kin hands off of me
calm down calm down now listen were gonna go around this corner and 
youre gonna suck me and my partners dicks or youre gonna
be one black dead nigger bitch

police brutality is common in my neighborhood
thats why i hate them motherf**kers

verse three mc ren

i said f**k the police but with a little more force
and maybe now i get my point across
its a lot here thats goin on just open your eyes and look
everyday a young nigga is took
off the face of the street by a police
its like they gotta a nigga chained on a short leash
you cant leave out the city that they shacked up
cause if you do thats the right they got you jacked up
its embarassin because you know they justice but all you can do
is say f**k this because if you move thats all she wrote
so what  the excuse to shoot or they rather stomp your head
til youre dead with the steel toe boot
harassin me with some kind of mind game
actin like a nigga just was born with a gang-name
you call that right but when youre black theres no right
some recreational shit was only a gang fight
so shootin at the cops was a street thing
to waste time have to explain dont do cocaine
but everything was done just for peace
to retaliate on the f**kin police so im sayin

chorus

f**k the police  f**k f**k f**k the police
f**k
f**k the police  f**k f**k the police
[the final episode]

episode three

ren
falling deep in the drums with many of styles
thats one of the reasons a nigga ran a hundred miles
cheating and out beating the crowd i kept seating
but weak motherf**kers biting off and they kept eating
styles they got are full of bull cause their vocals are local
in nightclubs and not getting paid in full
they got the nerve to cuss
only reason niggaz picking your record is cause they thought is was us

dre

dont see a psycho and then you just might go
mentally f**ked up when i let the rifle blow
dre

ren
the real niggaz is back cause theres to many bullshit records out
niggaz beat it for what we put out


but you dont have to wait no longer
because the new album is out and the shit is much stronger
so many groups made three albums or more
and their weak-ass shit is still sitting in the record-store
they wonder why it never sold
niggaz rapping since the seventies and still never went gold
our first record sold two million copies
thats because you other motherf**kers are sloppy
you came out the streets and crossed over
and after that your career is f**king over
because after that youre not around
so shut the f**k up and witness the sound of some real niggaz

eazy
yeah motherf**ker
keeping all you busters on the run in ninety-one kick that shit ren

ren
most niggaz cant understand
and never will if they aint part of the ruthless mafia-clan
niggaz is dedicated to the streets
with hyped f**king lyrics and a dope ass beat
the songs will never come soft because i come off
so dont get in my way or motherf**ker youll be cut off
and its something you can move your lips to
to wrap around my dick and suck if it fits you
and let me now if you wanna ride the d-i-c-k
all day thats with no play
cause aint no rap group out that i know
that makes me wanna listen to the radio
all i hear is motherf**kers trying to make a comeback with lovesongs
and that shit is whack
and thats why your ass aint around
cause you dont have the motherf**king sound of a real niggaim a muthafuking nigga wit an attitude4x 

dr dre 

i got a case of spitting in a muthafukers face 
so me and my ace we got a taste 
of a muthafukers billy club he took his gun and 
put it to my head and said nigga start running 
so tell me whats the next episode 
is he crazy  does he want to chase me and waste me 
i thought run nigga run but i caught myself 
because my secondary thought was death 
i get hit hard real but still muthafuker said 
i want another black muthafuker dead 
niggaz aint good for shit for me 
cause this is a race fo second class 
so get your ass up against the wall bitch 
and then he tried 
they jumped me but the punk became a victim of a walkby 
fuking wit dre you cant afford to be an asshole 
its just another way to let you know 
niggaz send themniggaz send them niggaz send them 
punk cant fuk wit me 
real muthafuking g got that 
straight from the streets of the cpt 
telling you why real niggaz dont die 

chorus 
i just want to celebrate 2x 

mc ren 

real niggaz dont die cause they eventually multiply 
the niggaz are wit it but taking out on i 
because the times are so wrong got to stay so strong 
niggaz got to keep going on and on 
and dont let no pail face they throw your ass in a cell race 
have you resident suck a pie in a jail space 
thats what they want to do cause the system is fuked around 
i try to let you know what the record its underground 


they dont give a fuk about a nigga 
they would rather pull the trigger 
and have you running from barrels smiling saying geez 
so nigga get smart and rebel back 
im not wit that black just so im not gonna nail that 
all i see is niggaz getting harrass 
we cant do nothing about it but get a foot in they ass 
yo but a very nigga grabbed a nine 
and started shooting muthafukers it would put them in line 
and thats how its suppose to be 
when the pussy ass niggas try to fuk wit me 
yo because the shoes let the dry 
to kill a nigga cause nigga a muthafuking real nigga dont die 

chorus 

im a muthafuking nigga wit an attitude 

eazy-e 

oh let the good die young so they make me young and bad 
putting ass kickings on the niggaz that never had 
so i guess that makes me tough shit 
straight up gangsta bum nigga to fuk wit 
so how can a nigga die when hes causing the bloodshed 
by shooting muthafukas in the head 
trying to make a nigga extinct because they fear me 
but never want to hear me 
so im a let em know how a niggas living 
checking for muthafukas cause nobody aint giving a damn thing 
to a nigga a real nigga 
so im living by the muthafuking trigger 
cause a nigga aint afraid of being locked up 
im out of luck so why should i give a fuk 
but they still want to try 
to kill a nigga like me but muthafuking real niggaz dont die 

choruswhy do i call myself a nigger you ask me
well its because motherf**kers want to blast me
and run me outa my neighborhood
they label me as a dope dealer
yo and say that im no good
but i cant find jobs so niggers wouldnt have to go out
gave up some dope on the corner so they could show out
when the cops came they gave a fake name
because the life in the streets is just a head game
so therefore to make more
a fifteen year old black kid will go and rob a liquor store
and get shot in the process
he ate up a nine bullet and now hes put to rest

why do i call myself a nigger you ask me
i guess its the way shit has to be
back when i was young gettin a job was murder
f**k flippin burgers
cause a deserve a nine-to-five i can be proud of
that i can speak loud of
and to help a nigger get out of
yo the concrete playground
but most motherf**kers only want you to stay down
but im a smart motherf**ker you see
one of the best producers in the rap music industry
gettin paid like a mother f**ker
a young brother who dont give a f**k about another

why do i call myself a nigger you ask me
because police always wanna harass me
every time that im rollin
they swear up and down that the car was stolen
make me get faced down in the street
they throw the shit out my car on the concrete
in front of a residence
a million white motherf**kers on my back like i shot the president

why do i call myself a nigger you ask me
because my mouth is so mother f**kin nasty
bitch this bitch that
nigger this nigger that
in the mean while my pockets are gettin fat
gettin paid to say this shit here
makin more in a week than a doctor makes in a year
so why not call myself a nigger
its better than pulling the trigger and goin up the river
and dont i get called a nigger anyway
booked as a motherf**ker and locked away
so so cut out all that bull shit
yo i guess ill be a nigga for life

{ niggers crack-heads thieves
if theres a hell below were all gonna go }


nigger nigger nigger
nigger nigger


nigger please
im treated like a f**kin disease 
you say why can i call myself a nigger so quick
cause i can reach in my draws and pull out a bigger dick
yo niggers say nigger we cool
but cracker say nigger not to f**k up
but i got to be a fast nigger

dr dre
yo there was a bitch i knew on the avenue
she was gettin g oh for a nut or two yo
i think her name was clara
and she was guaranteed to give a muthafucka whatever he needs
to be perfectly honest she was a hooker
so i took her a hundred yards to the boulevard
i told her ill take care o you you take care o me
you got a pimp and all i want is the money
she went to work and the niggaz were fiendin yo
she had the biggest ass that you ever seen
in fact she was like medusa
her tities fully grown
a look and your dick turns to stone yeah
keepin on mind that she was the kind that would find the time to get mine
because she knows im not to be fucked with
she aint crazy 
fuckin with dre shell be pushin up daisies
she was the perfect ho but wouldnt you know
the bitch tried to gank me
so i had to kill her
yeah straight hittin
now listen up and lemme tell you how i did it
yo i tied her to the bed
i was thinking the worst but yo i had to let my niggaz fuck her first yeah
loaded up the 44 yo
then i straight smoked the ho
cause im a real nigga but i guess you figure
i was soft so she paid the cost
to the boss and got tossed
one less bitch you gotta worry about
shes outa here and thats how it turns out

now vicky vicky vicky shes very tricky
she put her hicky on top of my dick
sick bitch see 
she told me she loved me and she wanted to keep me
if only she can have the dick weekly
i said im with it but baby you gotta hold up
if i was happy with somethin that i could fold up
we can do this 
she said her husband was rich
then i knew i had the bitch
yo she wrote a check many a check
in the name of a bitch who was strugglin at the same game
all i wanted to do was get paid
just a little somethin for fuckin me
yo everything was cool but vicky concerned me
her husband was the district attorney
so before he found out he was crossed up
by this bitch i was fuckin i had her tossed up
and put to sleep
so nigga never forget a dead bitch cant tell a nigga shit
one less bitch you gotta worry about
shes outa here and thats how it turned out

cause i said fuck it
loced and choked and spoked to the ho like this 
bitch its all about dre
the money money money and this all i gotta say
of course she came with me
and remained with me
till the bitch felt lame and ashamed to be
workin that trick shit
cause niggaz knew that she was someone
a little later though she caught one
in the chest and i knew that it was commin
by who and how the whole act would be done
so what
one less bitch you gotta worry about
but that aint how it turned out

mc ren

in the vault but the stupid bitch thought shed never get caught
came home early and straight bust her ass
on the couch with another nigga countin my cash
i shoulda knew she was like them other hos
i told them two muthafuckaz to take off their clothes
butt naked nothin left but the shoes
i had up the 9 so they couldnt refuse
i shot the nigga he was outta there

because the dumb bitch licks out the asshole
and a list of videotaper
and if you got a gang of niggaz the bitch would let you rape her
she likes suckin on dicks and lickin up nutz
and they even take de broomstick at the butt
just to say that she did it with a rapper
but the pussy was more fishy than red snapper
but how many licks would it take she axs
to make mc ren start gooshin up vanilla shake
she took her tongue out her mouth put it on top
like a cherry started movin it like a snake and it was very irresistable
i couldnt pay the bitch to quit
cause the ho was doin some ole crazy shit
that made me start havin a fit
cause the bitch sucks de hellified dick  [suck this dick]

and wash your ass sing this motherf**king shit

chorus till fade outeazy
what you want is an unexpected approach
that may delay a suspects awareness of your presence
until you have a chance to assist the situation you are confronted

approach to danger dont move;
its hard to predict what will happen next
oh shit he has a gun drop the gun
you couldve prevented a tragedy

ren
you can approach but the danger-light is blinking
a self-desctruct button is activated when im thinking
this is a tribulation the weakened judge
the prophecy was fulfilled cause i never budge
i took up the tools crucifixion was the extreme
theyre seeing doubles of me but it wasnt a dream
one vision was of life the other was death
then i didnt give a f**k if death took your last breath
so you burn in my pit that i call hell
where you got send because your shit dont sell
my twenty-twenty was blurry from the smoke
of the niggaz that i burned and tormented but i didnt choke
i started doing em i kept on doing em
do em for shoot em up till that nigga ren was booing em
and my presence to the suckers was of a stranger
but f**k it they can approach to the danger

eazy
if you can be seen you can be hit
if you can be hit you can be killed
hes on the line shoot him

dre
fatal approach to danger just to remain a strangeler
outrun the shot of a gun with a ganger


murder in the first degree but its worse to be
a dead motherf**ker or a nigga in custody
with everybody thinking of death i kept working
to be one of the last niggaz left
so many people looking for hope theyre broke
without checking the fingerprints on the motherf**kers throat
a heart of steal can reveil the real nigga in me
so figuring to see the d-e-a-d
bodies like a niggas straight walking in a cemetary
so its very necesarry to carry ammunition for niggaz wishing
but they better take caution before dre goes off
and starts killing motherf**kers
just in order to change the anger for the real nigga
when i approach to danger

approach the motherf**king danger
come back to hell and send me some time this is it yall

eazy
final approach to danger death destruction around every corner
another dead body and you wanna keep running
but even the rain turns black
all you can do is stay alert to try to say out of the search-light
no prison nobody makes bail
everybody gotta go but see it aint no jail
think about death taking your last breath
heart beating like a motherf**ker like there aint no time left
for so many ways to stay up i gotta get mine
even though they wanna make a crime
yo im being real a better or latter in the beginning
because it will release the f**king police
f**k em i approach to danger
cause i dont give a f**k if somebody gotta get f**ked up
so you might as well kiss your ass goodbye
cause in the long run well all dieoi motherf**ker
get yo motherf**kin hands off me motherfukin police officer
ei you bullshit
f**k that shit man im tired of you motherf**kers getin us always getin bust on motherf**ker shit always tweakin man

-&gt;music
yo wassup niggers and niggettes if you ever have a problem like this dont call that broke ass nigger you got and dont call that sorry bitch that dont give a f**k about you anyways what you need to do is call 1-900-2-compton well all right
1-900-2-compton thats 1-900-2-compton this show was sponsered by the niggers that dont give a f**kwhat we gonna do right here is go back

now this is some shit thats from the dayz of wayback
when niggas in compton first started to jack
when the bitches wouldnt give you no pussy if you wasnt sellin drug
so many bitches in my neighborhood got mugged
they always loved that shit they want a nigga thats sellin ks
but nowadays they workin at mickey ds
but in the dayz of wayback
i couldnt be laid back
because i needed ends and i made that
i get the nine from my nigga that he lend me and
start robbin muthaf**kas just like cowboys and indians
anything it took to get paid
a nigga like ren already had the plane made
and i was in it to win it and not to lose
and shit it start blowin up once i lit the fuse
and police couldnt touch me because i was payinem
but not with no money - yo i was frayinem
and never get caught because nobody is snitch
but one hoe did - so ren had to shoot the bitch
now shes in a coffin and my life is better off and
cause everybody knows whos the bossin
that black nigga that they call ren
you f**k with me you gotta f**k with a mac-10
so listen to me as i reminisce the dayz of wayback
so check it out yall

it was once a time in the dayz of wayback
when niggas was gettin jacked
in fact it was one i used to pass through up
and kickin ass through up
muthaf**kin compton massacre
now let me tell you a little something about compton
when i was a kid and puttin my bid in


yo compton was like still water - just strictly calm
now its like muthaf**kin vietnam
everybody killin tryin to make a killin
niggas stealin muthaf**kas willin to dealin
with so many ways to come up
the average nigga didnt give a f**k
about another muthaf**ka in this game and
claimin what he claimin
livin like he livin
killin after killin
murder was a dirty job to rob a dead man
was the best plan cause a dead man never ran
but now your best friend is your worst friend
greed cash the fee make a me more some of what you holdin
so now your shit is stolen
and you and your niggas start rollin
yo to get your shit back aint a word of
muff its more murder more murder more murder
they wanna make you think that its a crack thang
or a black thang
or some niggas in a muthaf**kin gang
but guns and money they go together like the ku klux klan
a nigga brung up and strung up
why do i call myself a nigga you ask me
rememberin the days thats past me
yo never givin niggas a chance to rest
the ghetto is like a f**kin survival test
and number one way for you to pass
