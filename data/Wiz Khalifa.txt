and man up to positively stand up

once again the youngest sin came to drop the hammer
how could a bystander feel that this is not bananas
we earn stripes you all hype in that propaganda
gats spot you cats shot but not from cameras
back glock cause snap shotsll stop your plan up
stuck in my ways the haze taste like tropicana
thinkin the days of way back people will say that
the youngin was gifted sick when he stayed back
now the people listenin play back i got it made
obligated to gettin passin grades and blaze tracks
youll be amazed at how i make units move
self-made twelfth grade boy ill take you to school

pullin stunts and
rollin blunts
with my dudes from the hood
but to you they no good
im just doin what i could
and thats givin the circumstances

instead of trying to find dirt
and where your manners
try and understand when that work demanded
and no mama thats not a punch line
im always there when its crunch time
but still you say

kelly sometimes i dont know if youre tellin the truth

everytime you get mad when i ask you what you do what you do

but still i made it back  the new face of rap 
e figured out tha flow was coke

alot of chronic smoke  yunq broad come puff wit me
a attitude like yall dudes cant fuck wit me
still i stay humble 
focussed on my hustle
later forgettin it but everything got doubled
&amp; my team got bubbled
anybody that seen our struggle got respect nah mean for the youngen cards 
its more than just music this more than deaths music
its hood then lets do it 
the birds best
yes here in the flesh
smart to do it talkin ess then lets prove it 
thats why my shit go hard yours got less movement
im on top of things you busy droppin names
on file no physics can stop the flame
think of the lives we can drop some change 
lets do it im so incredible wait

wit no metal to waist

i flow great

and thatll level ya face

but ill still let a nigga have it

you talk greasy but u still a faggot

i front on cowards cause u niggas backwards

i got my money right

game on top

and its been said that im the key to put this game on lock

im from tha city

of the triflin hoods

but when u see me

gotta smile on my face

nuttin sweet its just that life is good

yea i dodged the hood

slums came up out that

rap game about that

to gain pay wit out crack

see imma youngin wit too much on my plate

to let some small change have a youngin dumped in a cage

i seen niggas make sells

niggas get knocked and make bail

and take lives they worries aint jail

wit no regards for life cause they livin aint well

who gotta make it to heaven cause they livin in hell

but me i dont do much just keep to myself

and stop these cock-suckin motha-fuckas seekin my wealth

i was told the worlds cold but i see for my self

and im too hot to take the back seat or the shelf

so im here

for sum reason though they hate it to death

the loves gone only hatred is left

only achin and stress

a king not be mistaken for less

and this here is for the taking

this is history in the making

where im from its kinda hard to trust

cause the hates from most of your own people

theyre fake and theyre all see through

hate to see a nigga when hes stackin his bucks

rather him be down in the dumps

and out on his luck

but ill be damned if my grind stop

my mind tickin like the time watch

and im gon be spittin till the times not

presently there

i touch minds everywhere

and ill ride hopin heaven is near

see the pain in your eyes young wit every stare

i seek peace but these streets will never be fair

cause somebody went and took gregs life

son reached

deceased

no time to blink or think twice damn

wonder when it gonna be my time

to meet death

im stressed need to ease my mind

and unless one of yall try to see whats mine

then ill eat through your flesh bones and leave that spine

u see i did the right thing

i stayed up out the gun and knife game

i knew about the pain it might bring

and we all got problems

i chose to smoke blunts just to drown em

the top but i rose from the bottom

and im here now

aint no body harming young

my screws loose they say somethings wrong wit young

ya times up im just warning young

cause this heres for the taking

this is history in the makingnever too late too late to start start never too late too late to start start 

im tryna have the wrist all bladed up
with all kitted up
niggas say damn change wiz couldnt give a fuck
spit it like my last song one life live it up
niggas see damns change kids couldnt get a buck
so please dont approach me man
like this a free show cause you dont know me me fam
and please dont extend your hands like you know we fam
and please dont pretend like we only scram
where was all this love at when i was only can
when i was tryna sell yall my only jam

if you dont know me now then how you know me then
and i hope yall loving the kid but if not its

never too late too late to start start never too late too late to start start 

im tryna have the strip all whipped out

would harass but they cant really not now
used to laugh but your mans really hot now
i used to rap for the kids in class
told em i would use rap just to get my cash
and i was on the word about how to get my math
and told my teachers and the staff they can kiss my ass
cause i cant find a interest in my book
so i stayed to myself and every class i took
supposed to be doing work but i made my hooks
cause i get motivation everywhere i look
and i show no regret for any chance i took
but i learn from mistakes just like i should
so if you dudes aint payed your dues for you fools its

but what you say to me aint guaranteed to always be the gospel
i was doing good way before i met you
now youre off the set
and im a let you see the show go on without you
take a bow think about it
and hopefully we could be friends but i really doubt it
see you be catching feelings now and i be catching planes
the story of my life youre just another page

[chorus 2]
but everythings good until it goes bad
and your gonna tell all the people about the fun you used to have
it hurts when it dont last
no easy way saying bye
so im a spread my wings and head for the sky
and i fly solo
i fly solo
and i fly solo
and i fly solo
and i

[outro]
i had a dream that the whole world was staring at me staring at me
i woke up and wasnt no one there no one there
yeah eh eaah[wiz khalifa - verse 1]
and they say they ballin but i do it how the pros do
where we goin next we gon let my hoes choose
no socks and my boat shoes
guess a n-gga eating good like whole foods
not a couple cameras now they bring the whole crew
bad bitch ride wit me so she pose too
see me and my guys like a plane flown through
hella high roll up weed up like im supposed too
and now im into big things
on the building you need to know the tenant rate
gettin paid still ridin no shirt
let a b-tch give me brain call it home work
n-ggas try hatin on em but it dont work

[chorus]
alota shit done change
new clothes new car new things
sayin boy they used to be at the bottom
came up thats what they say
used to not be allowed in the building
but now we on the roof top
used to not be allowedd in the building
but now we on the roof top
slow money just better than gettin no money

learn to get good show money thats yo money
get comfortable with it really know money
rich n-gga shit that really goes for me
self made n-gga well played
im on the plane drinkin champagne and lemonade
you tryna copy whats done im tryna innovate
and club owners getting tired of tryna ventilate
big mistake
im too busy finding places and trips to take
the more i smoke the more money my business make
remember they used to be like who is this
now im up in this bitch they light up like independance day
when you around the real you keep it real everyday
my n-ggas keep it real so i hear what they say

either you getting paid or you paying to play
either you on your grind or you stay out the way

[chorus]

[curren$y]
uhh just made a million got another million on my schedule
the pick up on my ferrari you jets or you jetless
you n-ggas aint help us on second thoughts you did
they hatin was the fuel for this shit so you wrote your own check off a hoe ass
sweatin bullets at home wondering if she coming back
 and she she can smell it on ya
thats why you only see her when you buying stuff for her
we was sneaking in then it was general admission
now we own the arena deciding who allowed in it
our windows aint tinted pimpin i aint trippin
had showered that shit im just ballin and chillin
we plooted this out one night in the city
now we los angeles medicine cabinet twisting
our habits are expensive we gotta have it
twit-picing when we get it and they mad at us
f-ck them n-ggas

[chorus]

[wiz khalifa]
alotta money lotta luggage lotta hoes
when you putting in work thats how it goes
alotta money lotta luggage lotta hoes
when you putting in work thats how it goes
alotta money lotta luggage lotta hoes
when you putting in work thats how it goes
alotta money lotta luggage lotta hoes
when you putting in work thats how it goes

and if the kids tryna be like me they probably smoking bout an o
oh aint my fault though[verse 1]
um its hardly a secret
you aint gon stop tryna get where you going until you reach it
always had them bars back in the day
when the same ones running up on you wasnt speaking

buses nigga too had to charge it to the game
always wanted stardom n the fame

and now it aint no stopping the champagne from poppin
the draws from droppin
us seeing muscle cars and coppin em
started off just a little less popular

[chorus]
now you got a new place
you drive a new car
you smile for cameras than life like a superstar
dont care what they say
you reach for the stars
got everything you always dreamed or thought about
and everyone knows who you are

[verse 2]
never gets boring
and haters in your face you just ignore ã¢â¬ëem
dont know what they talking shit for
seems niggas get theres you just tryna get yours
therefore you left all the people you care for
hopped on a plane and got airborn
seen all the bullshit and fell for it
but its all good now
cause the same ones that talk shit telling everyone you made it
then you start seein hoes you dated
then thoughts started getting jaded
now your lifes sort of different aint it
feel your scars knowin what your pain is
but whats it all worth if its painless
say you wanna be famous

[chorus]
now you got a new place
you drive a new car
you stop all the cameras than life like a superstar
dont care what they say

got everything you always dreamed or thought about
and everyone knows who you are

and we had to go our separate ways
instead of fussin and flippin out

hey man green is for the money gold is for the honeys
step up your game or step down
whenever a problem troubles us all
if you trust in the lord there will be a brighter tomorrow
for theres nothing too much for the great god to do
and all that he asks and expects of you
is faith thats unshaken by tribulation and yield
confidence and knowledge that god knows best
and trouble and sorrow they are only a test
but without god testin of our soul
it never could reach the ultimate goal
so keep on knowing and believing
all that god has promised you would be yours to receive
preach church tabernacle
