the pressure 
you gotta find a way to deal with dealin with the peer pressure

verse one havoc

as a young black teen everyday i deal
with the pressure and mixed up is how i feel
i walk the streets with a fuck you attitude
and when it comes to my peoples you aint half as rude
follow the crowd or be a leader take your pick
now im smokin buddha philly blunt style
a frustrated and confused young juvenile
king of the project blues so i choose
to take a piece of the action
but my sober state of mind wont let it happen
so twenty-four-seven its the number one stresser
dealin with the peer pressure

chorus

verse two prodigy

most dont understand how it is
in the world of today growin up as a young black teen
i used to dream of bein a architect
easier said than done believe me its hard to get
out of the projects without forgettin where you came from

my parents told me from day one
finish school and avoid all obstacles
but my environment makes it so impossible
for instance build a strong social life
without messing up still trying to live right
like in junior high i used to wonder why
certain females went out with certain guys
then one day it all dawned on me yo
you gotta be down and have it goin on see
i wasnt down with the mainstream or
should i say their team now im gettin steamed
gotta find a way to get accepted by my peers
so now im sippin on beers
buyin new gear nuthin but the best
forget levis strictly polo and guess
but how would i make the cash
it gotta be easy and it gotta be fast
thinkin to myself does that make me lesser
just dealin with the peer pressure

chorus 2x

verse three havoc

around my way theres a kid that most dont understand
how he lives is it negative or positive
he has a grade a average
but when hes on the streets with his friends hes a savage
a freshman of high school daily attendant
he never got in trouble never did he get suspended
good little kenny who would believe
he dropped out of school to start to smoke weed
i saw the signs but i didnt pay attention
because he got offended everytime that i would mention
the drinkin the smokin the low school grades
and sleepin in class laid back with his black shades
nowadays you catch kenny hangin in the hallways
with his crew findin more ways
to break out of school and hit the block and get buckwild
stay out of the way of a mad child
cause hes a product of hell
kenny never fell but hes gonna fall overall
so lets take a trip to the ghetto

another war story from a thirsty young hustler
wont trust ya id rather bust ya and leave your corpse
for the cops to discover while i be dippin in the range rover
all jewelled like liberace

you watch me while jakes tryin to knock me and lock me
but ill be on the low sippin asti spumante
niggaz try to creep on the side of my jeep
stuck the heat through the window rocked they ass to sleep
over a 3-pack it was a small thing really yeah
but keep lettin them small things slide and be a failure

if im out of town one of my crewll take care of ya
the world is ours and your teams inferior
you wanna bust caps i get all up in your area
kidnap your children make the situation scarier
life is a gamble we scramble for money
i might crack a smile but aint a damn thing funny

im caught up in the dirt where your hands get muddy
plus the outcome turns out to be lovely
got gs in my pocket hit off my main squeeze
push back the sunroof let the cold air breeze
through the butter soft leather upholestry
but mostly keep the gat closely cuz niggaz wanna toast me

yo i gotta get mines no matter what the con-sequences
count up my blessings add up my weapons
cock back the gat and let my nine serve purpose
sling do my thing organize fiend servants
tryin to make a mil is stress you know the deal
so we sling drills get your cap peeled cuz everything is real
cause i wanna chill laid up in a jacuzzi

sippin bubbly with my fingers on the uzi
try to infiltrate my fort get caught
dead up in new york my brain is packed with criminal thoughts
get your life lost never found again my friend
mission completed watch you drop in less than ten

on my road to the riches hittin snitches off with mad stitches
your last restin placell be a ditch kid
no one can stop me try your styles sloppy
want to be me youre just an imitation copy
my theme is all about making the green
livin up in luxury pushin phat whips and livin comfortably

[chorus]

a drug dealers dream
stash cream keys on a triple beam
five hundred sl green ninety-five nickle gleam
condominium thug dressed like a gentleman
tailor made ostrich chanel for my women friend
murderin numbers on your head while im burglarin
shank is servin em whassup to all my niggaz swervin in
new york metropolis the bridge brings apocalypse

shoot at the clouds feels like the holy beast is watchin us
mad man my sanity is goin like an hourglass
gun inside my bad hand i sliced tryin to bag grams
i got hoes that used to milk you
niggaz who couldve killed you
is down with my ill crew of psychoes
nas escobar movin on your weak production
pumpin corruption in the third world we just bustin

hold up and analyze the wildcats slang cracks
they swing an axe the new routines be my eyes blacks
playin corners glancin all up in your cornea
corner ya seen cats snatch monies up on ya
but late night candlelight fiend with a crack right
its only right feelin higher than an airplane right
word yo i want to get this money then blow

take my time blast a nine if you front you go
sip beers the german ones hand my guns to sons

but still write my will out to my seeds then build

its all strange my niggas locked down thinking long range
and see their names in the daily news third page
they sent a kite to my nigga killa
it only took one sword to put seven holes in his squila
a 3 to 9 spending most of his time inside the bin
reclined and still came home with a shinehey yo queens get the money long time no cash
im caught up in the hustle when the guns go blast
the fool retaliated so i had to think fast
pull out my heat first he pull out his heat last

im tryin to tell these young niggas crime dont pay
they looked at me and said queens niggas dont play do your thing
ill do mine kid stay outta my way

lock me up for ever but they cant deflate me cause
havin cash is highly addictive
especially when youre used to havin money to live with

i got my mind on the stick-up now its time to get paid
thinkin of ways to take loot already made
theres crime in the air aint no time to be afraid

they probably knock down the door
in the middle of the night sometimes around four
hopin to find who theyre lookin for but they want ta see
all they gonna find is mad empty bags of weed
but worse son you got the projects hotter than hell
harder for brothers to get their thug on but oh well

what up black hold your head wherever you at
on the flow from the cops or wings on your backs
that snitch nigga gave police your location
well chop his body up in six degrees of separation
killer listen shit aint the same without you at home
phony niggas walk around tryin to be your clone
they really fear you when you was at home you was pale
thats why they wanna see you either dead or in jail
by the time you hear this rhyme you probably be locked up
tried to hussle where along the lines your plan slipped up
got caught up in a crime that you cant take back
reminisce on how i use to pick you up in the ac
years ago when we was younger seemed the hood took us under very deep
wonderin who snitched and got me losin lots of sleep
at night you know my mouth is tight
i never sang to the cops cos that shit aint right
sometimes i stroll past the scene of the crime and backtrack
damn why the situation go down like dat
itll be a long time before the heat dies down
in a couple of years fool well see you around
but til then maintain and keep ya story the same
the cops is grabbin wrong niggas lookin for someone to blame
they harrassin strugglin to find the truth
is it a chance ya casell get thrown out cos they aint got no proof
to say youre guilty your fingerprints filthy
deliver me the gun ill tie two quickly throw it in the river
make sure its safe to the bottom
our smart police snuck you out at the projects we got em
but still but still but still

chorus x3

surprisin
*repeat to fade*verse one prodigy

it all began on the street to the back of a blue police vehicle
next come the bookends the way things is looking
its friday you in for a long stay gettin shackled on the bus
first thing come monday hoping in your mind youll be released one day
but knowing home is a place youre not going for a long while
now youre up on the isle in a position that you aint got to refusing
to smile
but keep in mind theres a brighter day after your time spent
used to be wild but locked up you cant get bent
thought you could hack it now youre requesting pee see you fragile
it aint hard to see niggas like that dont associate with me
id rather get busy to the third degree
cause the war populations are
if this was the street my razor would be a mack demon
hit you up leave your whole face screaming what you in for kid
busting nuts taps heard of million street stories caught inside this trap
who are you to look at me with your eyes like that
wising up young blood before you make things escalate and i would hate
to set your crooked ass straight

chorus 

make your moves at night pack your heat in this warzone niggas is trife
runnin from one time aint no time to slip make one false move
and its a up north trip
livin the high life make your moves at night pack your heat in this warzone
niggas is trife runnin from one time aint no time to slip make one
false move and its a up north trip

verse two havoc

you tried to dip duck but still got bucked you talk too much shit
you should have kept your mouth shut all that gossip
motherfucker dont you know my glock kicks hollow tips
to your body mad toxic i fade you blow you with a rusty-ass razor
did you a favor tried to wet you but i grazed you
pop goes the glock when theres beef on the block chill for a while
make them think the beef stop then i creep like a thief in the night
its only right aint no turnin back its on tonight and if i get caught
then my ass is up north straight on the course for upstate new york
stress smokin back to back cigaretttes it popped off gon point in
the mess hall
but to avoid that from head to toe dipped in all black hit them niggas
where they pump they cracks at havoc with the murder masterplan
keep my nine up to par so my shit wont jam god forbid if my shit do
run behind a tree fix my shit then hit you slugs in your body
mainly in your brain tissue witness from the scene get ghost stash
the pistol
so simple then watch my back lay up and relax roll a sack k-a black
find a shorty intact

chorus

verse three prodigy

i got the powder combine wit the powder and water it oughtta
drop in a half and hour in the form of oil watch the cocaine boil
keep my eye on it so the shit wont spoil then i pause
and ask god why did he put me on the serve just so i could die
i sit back and build on all the things i did wrong why im still breathing
and all my friends gone i try not to dwell on the subject for a while
cause i might get stuck in this corrupt lifestyle but my
heart pumps foul blood through my arteries and i cant turn it back
its a part of me too late for cryin im a grown man struggling
to reach the next level of life without fumbling down to folding
i got no shoulder to lean on but my own all alone in this danger zone
time waits for no man the streets grow worse fuck the whole world kid
my money comes first cause im out for the gusto and trust nobody
if youre not family then you die by me cause niggas will have you
locked up
the snitch be a man givin police the run down on your plans
were never goin down like that so i shut my mouth and hold my words back
the legal business forever mine fuck payin taxes the last kid that shitted

and gave police access to my blueprints used names as evidence
skipped town and i havent seen the snitch nigga ever since
the moral of the story is easy to figure out a lesson that you cant
live without

repeat chorus once

or locked up caught inside the beast

but gold couldnt take the dick and made me lazy
we split apart and now i met this new trick dany

our love combines to form a science what is this
i bust a cherry took her virginity in ninety-one
now that shes open everybody want to tap somethin
go get your own dont make me have to fuckin clap somethin
i love my shorty more than life now aint that somethin
so love you dany more than livin itself
even though my friends tell me she aint good for my health
when i go pick her up they tell me put her back on the shelf
they say say yo p she only wants you for one thing thats your wealth
but i dont pay attention shes my baby the dany
you know she drive me crazy shes my number one lady
met her back in eighty-nine now shes twenty-two

verse two q-tip

tommy hil was my nigga and others couldnt figure
how me and hilfiger used to move through with vigor
had to sit and plan on how to make these seven figures
said the brinks is comin through at fashion avenue
at tuesday at two now we gotta form a crew
now we gotta forum a crew of motherfuckers
who aint goin out like suckers
told me call karl kani and all my other brothers
i told my sister walker who was the smoothest talker
negotiate the deal with them other money stalkers
diesel drove the the beemer the hatchback of course
nauticall navigate to keep us on course
polos acting bolo trying to say he the boss
i said shut the fuck up the kid is out where the loots at
got a big trey pound picture just to swoop back
timb is on the roof with the twelve gauge rifle
scope is on the top so you know he livin eiffel
took the aim of oswald caught him north in the face
all them other kids they had they tools aimed at space
levi had the snub so you know they gettin laced
donna karan was cryin cause mad shells was flyin
damn all we want is a piece of the pie and
nike scooped the sess cause he moves like air
threw them shits up in the trunk now we up out here
got back to the mansion to divvy up the paper
helle hansen was the brain of the whole entire caper
so she felt it was right for her to get the whole slice
everybody in the crew didnt think it was nice
i guess not and guess whats hot so guess what
guess took the jigga and jigged her in the gut

chorus

when you play with crime sometimes its not too fly
even though the goods look deceivin to the eye
the end situation could leave your ass dry
thats why you got to walk on by walk on by
walk on by walk on by walk on by

verse three havoc

my man p put me on to the shorty henn rock
now henn rock is strong enough to make your heartbeat stop

i got you stuck off the realness

the mobb comes equipped with warfare beware
of my crime family who got nuff shots to share
for all of those who wanna profile and pose
rock you in your face stab your brain wit your nosebone
you all alone in these streets cousin
every man for theyself in this land we be gunnin
and keep them shook crews runnin like they supposed to
they come around but they never come close to
i can see it inside ya face youre in the wrong place
cowards like you just get theyre whole body laced up
with bullet holes and such
speak the wrong words man and you will get touched
you can put your whole army against my team and
i guarantee you itll be your very last time breathin
your simple words just dont move me youre minor were major 
you all up in the game and dont deserve to be a player
dont make me have to call your name out; your crew is featherweight 
my gunshotsll make you levitate
im only nineteen but my mind is old
and when the things get for real my warm heart turns cold
another nigga deceased another story gets told
it aint nothin really hey yo dun spark the phillie
so i can get my mind off these yellowbacked niggas
why they still alive i dont know go figure
meanwhile back in queens the realness is foundation
if i die i couldnt choose a better location
when the slugs penetrate you feel a burning sensation
getting closer to god in a tight situation now
now take these words home and think it through
or the next rhyme i write might be about you

chorus
son they shook
cause aint no such things as halfway crooks
scared to death scared to look 
they shook

some of em get shot locked down and turn nuns
cowardly hearts end straight up shook onesshook ones

for every rhyme i write its 25 to life
yo its a must the gats we trust safeguardin my life

you dont know me theres no relation
queensbridge niggas dont play i dont got time 
for your petty thinking mind son im bigga than those 
claimin that you pack heat but youre scared to hold
and when the smoke clears youll be left with one in your dome
13 years in the projects my mentality is what kid
you talk a good one but you dont want it
sometimes i wonder do i deserve to live
or am i going to burn in hell for all the things i did
no time to dwell on that cause my brain reacts
front if you want kid lay on your back
i dont fake that kid you know i bring it to you live
stay in a childs place kid you out o line
criminal minds thirsty for recognition
im sippin; e&amp;j got my mind flippin
im buggin; think im how bizarre to hold my hustlin
get that loot kid you know my function
cause long as im alive ima live illegal
and once i get on ima put on on my people

when i roll up dont be caught sleepin cause im creepin

chorus

im down to stickin out west bank for my mill
and im from hampstead its close to the shacks of park south
well ill be outside slingin youre always high
and dont come around to the crossroads of life
were to the death you and me this beef for eternity
im goin out to the fullest extent
so far into my troubles its hard for me to get back
to my everyday self and composure

not a game but quite serious and yo in fact
youll be runnin for dear life so far you might fall off the map

hennessee raps float like the phantom
runnin you up out of the spot in which you standin
never second-guess a cat who hold gat
concealed but easily revealed and fast
body castin raps to get your back snapped in half
and severed impossible pain beyond measure

potentially dangerous fatally left open
for the roaches scavengers thats ems
funeral homes anticipatin your death

enough to make you think and stop before your ship sink

vision the days hear the ghost whisper
dogs we left in the past brought back now here with us
cross my heart let the haze linger
pour out a little liquor knowin god took a good nigga
thousand dollar slippers skirt from the scene he was just a worker dog

fuck that not because we have to i want to
i love this shit the raw is what i live for
to hear the sound of the crowd roar for more
to see the niggas that cant pay rush the door
whylin on the dancefloor
when they song come on swingin they fists ready for war
but its a different type of effect its not violence
theyre just tranced by the advance
tranked by the sound bank
put under the drum numbed off of our shit
now who you rockin wit them or us
deep love or cheap lust qb ll bust
infamous till we pass on
you laughin at the wrong shit i take ac-tion

nigga i write bombs thatll shatter your ambitions of bein top dog
as we move through the stage fog
i need to bass more
so i can taste it and make yall go awol
and lose it say no more brace your delf nigga its on 

verse 2 cormega

yo back up yo

whos tale you tellin are you frail or felon
were you makin sales or watchin niggas sellin
you exploit niggas lives in your rhymes and then avoid em
you never felt the moisture in the air of coke boilin
you never felt the razor scrapin your plate
your hands achin yet you keep choppin cause theres paper to make
you never felt the power of invincibility
clutchin a gun like fuck it dun its him or me
at your best you was a hand to hand
no more than three grams
what the fuck you know about a ki man
you never hustled
lets get it right my nigga y wouldve stuck you
stop dry snitchin in your rhymes listen
what you tryin to do help the guys in blue
indight niggas so that can be another rhyme for you
you a parasite you never had a life
so you throw other niggas lives in your pad at night
its clever when you write it
spoken well for a dude who never been indighted
you know the deal mothafucka the real make the fake niggas kneel
and lose appetites when you taste niggas steel
my rhymes are what it takes to get a deal and make it real
im like big you cant replace the skill
i laced it ill like cocaine in scarfaces grill
your mothafuckin flow is basic chill
im cormega raw forever

your whole team is pussy when i squeeze vaginas bleed
my lyrics stay official
i bagged up coke on dishes made of crystal
your niggas they wont miss you
my nickel-plated pistol - got sixteen shots you can take em wit you
to the coffin or das office
surgeory nurses screamin we lost him
life suddenly divorced him fuck it it cost him
if you want beef say no more
brace your delf nigga its on we spray four-fours bitchtragedy

thug shit for your ear

tragedy

[verse 1 kool g rap]
like a don from out of sicily
under the arm is where the pistol be
top of your forehead the kiss will be
plant it ever so soft and gentle but die viciously
hours of torture before the torture apply misery
days before i feel pity to give a guy liberty
seat of his pants shitty and eyes all glittery
ill die a rich man before the fbi figure me
40 storeys up inside a high-rise in italy
no hittin forces only natural courses could liver me
gray hairs from the great years the fears never shiver me
reminiscing how we car bombed ignitions
and politicians judges strong-armed to listen
men turning up dead or hurt harmed and missing forever
bulletproof cars are driven teflon edition
bodies cut up in large chunks thrown in car trunks
music inside the bar stunk   
gettin surrounded by bitches blowin some cigars drunk
one of my stone face goons will make your heart pump
electrocution with cables that make your car jump
the yard punks the sin with the life sentence for sellin hard junk
the family the whole commission
has been around since the days before prohibition
mathematics was good then no slow addition
some overdose down the coke slope and dope addiction
lookin back on them days i ran a whole division
some of the jake in the state was tryna throw the mission
they caught a ticket ride to hell with no admission
beyond these tracks   
our life and network of sippin bourbon and cognac
first version observing the stocks and bonds we stack
thug chronicles these are the days of don g rap

[havoc]
wit murder on his mind take it in blood
we takin that aim at niggaz throwin shit in the game

[verse 2 kool g rap]
we do our thing under handily still
tuck a mil for the family will
mansion and hot wheels in amityville
treat a snitch nigga like sam when he squeel
break the code of silence just hand me the steel
for every wrong done a man will be killed
theres plans to re-build   
curtains and drapes got the jakes tryna can me for real
until then be in the backyard with clam on the grill
or catch me laid up in the canopy ill
with two mamis handing me thrills
vivica fox body vanity grills
rubberbanding these bills
tryna duck the fame of the glamor
tryna stay from out the range of the scanners
not tryna get my frame in a camera
avoid tabloids and front pages
bums get knocked off and bumped for favors
collect trump papers with pumps and gauges
royale suites when i bunk in vegas
got homicide searching the city dumped for neighbors
pinky ring with a chunk of glacier
copped a spot with a bunch of acres
some them got their bodies slumped from capers
barcaleno hat tux and gators
got a crib full of house maids butlers and waiters
my clique from the minor league jump the majors
we gon rock it til we jackpot fuck them haters
if we have to run up in city hall abduct the mayor
any man against the master plan get bucked wit craters

in the palm of my hands fiending
but quickly to be scheming; if you choose to front on me
that leaves me with no choice but to start squeezing
and i hope they stop breathing
because if they do pull through in the hospital beds
theyll be squealing - talking to these ds man

i did my little bid in  so whats up
dare a nigga trouble us make my niggas risk all of this
infamous good shit so quick

change and pinky rings estates for the kings
a queens-bred gentlemen she know how we bang
you tamper with this plush lifestyle may you lay
in a hole til you ferment your bones decay

[chorus]

we come from where murders occur often on late nights
niggas is high and they eyes be red as two brake lights
medical marijuana henny bottles and grey goose
semis and shottys on deck everybodys face screwed
but you know this already my hood the coldest and deadly
soldiers is ready i am boastful forgive me
bitches talking and cops cry when they nigga get washed
 if they squashed go finish that shit that you start
no clip in your glock you aint prepared to fire
we call that riding with no air in your tire
youre flattened its a pattern after scrapping
what usually happen death on arrival
survival of the fittest aint nothing like that queensbridge shit
yall niggas finished your only chances are diminished
and we dont need no fucking witness
aint what you know its what you live and we live it

let me start from the beginning at the top of the list
knowhatimean have a situation like this
another war story from a thirsty young hustler
wont trust ya id rather bust ya and leave your corpse
for the cops to discover while i be dippin in the range rover
all jewelled like liberace

you watch me while jakes tryin to knock me and lock me
but ill be on the low sippin asti spumante
niggaz try to creep on the side of my jeep
stuck the heat through the window rocked they ass to sleep
over a 3-pack it was a small thing really yeah
but keep lettin them small things slide and be a failure

if im out of town one of my crewll take care of ya
the world is ours and your teams inferior
you wanna bust caps i get all up in your area
kidnap your children make the situation scarier
life is a gamble we scramble for money
i might crack a smile but aint a damn thing funny

im caught up in the dirt where your hands get muddy
plus the outcome turns out to be lovely
got gs in my pocket hit off my main squeeze
push back the sunroof let the cold air breeze
through the butter soft leather upholestry
but mostly keep the gat closely cuz niggaz wanna toast me

yo i gotta get mines no matter what the con-sequences
count up my blessings add up my weapons
cock back the gat and let my nine serve purpose
sling do my thing organize fiend servants
tryin to make a mil is stress you know the deal
so we sling drills get your cap peeled cuz everything is real
cause i wanna chill laid up in a jacuzzi

sippin bubbly with my fingers on the uzi
try to infiltrate my fort get caught
dead up in new york my brain is packed with criminal thoughts
get your life lost never found again my friend
mission completed watch you drop in less than ten

on my road to the riches hittin snitches off with mad stitches
your last restin placell be a ditch kid
no one can stop me try your styles sloppy
want to be me youre just an imitation copy
my theme is all about making the green
livin up in luxury pushin phat whips and livin comfortably

[chorus]

i couldnt believe it; i had the power of life or death
in the palm of my hands fiending
but quickly to be scheming; if you choose to front on me
that leaves me with no choice but to start squeezing
and i hope they stop breathing
because if they do pull through in the hospital beds
theyll be squealing - talking to these ds man
they dont waste no time they want answers
even if youre still bleeding
homey im on the fleezy
i aint got no time neither im making money off of this - its too easy
