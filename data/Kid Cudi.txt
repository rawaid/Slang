closing your eyes the feeling so right
at first you might see this one bright beam of light
clutching your soul to the toll of the blight
happy unites and feelings take flight
blind to the evils you give them no sight
focus on floatin your focus is tight
like you rewrote a essay for a class
to pass in the night
have you ever seen the ending so nice
you feel so free like your high as a kite
like how you feel if you drink some bud light
followed by jag
models will smile then tilt their heads back
these are a few of the visions i like
mixed in with light these are my favorites to dream in the night
this is my heaven at nite

heaven at nite heaven at nite

narrator common 
long before we know ourselves our paths are already set in stone 
some may never figure out their purpose in life and some will 
there are alot of us who are caught up in this hell we all live in - 
content with being blinded by rules and judgement 
we live in a world where its more okay to follow than to lead 
in this world being a leader is being trouble for this system we are accustomed to 
being a leader in this day &amp; age is being a threat 
not many people stood up against the system we all call life 
but towards the end to the first ten years into the millenium we heard a voice 
a voice who were speaking to us from the underground for some time 
a voice who spoke of vulnerabilites and other human emotions and issues never heard so vividly and honest 
this is the story of a young man who not only believed in himself but his dreams too 
this is the story of the man on the mooni got 99 problems and they all bitches
wish i was jigga man carefree living
but im not sean or martin louis
im that cleveland nigga rolling with them brooklyn boys
you know what i be when you start living large
i control my own life charles was never in charge
no sitcom could teach scott about the dram or even explain the troubles that haunted my mom
on christmas time my mom christmas grind
got me most of what i wanted howd you do it mom huh
she copped the toys i would play with in my room by myself
why he by himself he got two older brothers - one hood one good
an independent older sister kept my fly when she could
but they all didnt see the little bit of sadness in me scotty

hook
ive got some issues that nobody can see
and all of these emotions are pouring outta me
i bring them to the light for you its only right
this is - the soundtrack 2 my life yeah yeah the soundtrack 2 my life oh

im super paranoid like a 6th sense
since my father died i aint been right since
and i tried to piece the puzzle of the universe
split a 8th of shrooms just so i can see the universe
i try to think about myself as a sacrifice 
just to show the kids they aint the only ones who up at night
the moon will illuminate my room and soon im consumed by my doom
once upon a time nobody gave a fuck its all said and done and my cocks been sucked
so now im in the cut alcohol in the wound my hearts an open sore that i hope heals soon
i live in a cocoon opposite of cáncun where its never sunny the dark side of the moon
so its more than right - i try and shed some light on a man
not many people of this planet understand fam

hook
ive got some issues that nobody can see
and all of these emotions keep pouring outta me
i bring them to the light for you its only right
this is - the soundtrack 2 my life the soundtrack 2 my life oh


im prolly this close to go and tryin some coke
and the happy ending would be slitting my throat
ignorance to cope man ignorance is bliss ignorance is love and i need that shit
if i never did shows then id prolly be a myth
if i cared about the blogs then id prolly be a jackass
dont give a shit what people talk about fam
haters shake my hand but i keep the sanitizer on deck
hope i really get to see 30
wanna settle down stop being so flirty
most of the clean faces be the most dirty 
i just need a thoroughbred cook when im hungry
ass all chunky brain is insanity
only things that calm me down - pussy and some cali tree
and i get both never truly satisfied
i am happy thats just the saddest lie

hook
ive got some issues that nobody can see
and all of these emotions keep pouring outta me
i bring them to the light for you its only right
this is - the soundtrack 2 my life the soundtrack 2 my life ohyeah yeah yeah

im dreaming on good for a sicker plan
sicker than any other nigga could be thinking than
i cant be a loser couldve figured that

simple way i wish you woulda called it how it shoulda been
they try to tell me they dont get it
they dont know the deal
now ill be damned i came this far to let a fool live
i gotta terminate the hate spread the positive
without it bein wack and cheesin to the little kids 
so i curse like a sailor and i smoke weed
i am exactly who in all the rappers kids be
and who they love
hands to the universe
pop between the drug addicts if they spit a cudi verse
mad little mama switch her converse out her purse 
long as the booty lookin juicy and hes stylin on her

as simple as that
as simple as that
as simple as that for your simple ass

as simple as that
as simple as 1 2 3

lightning piercing through another land
over the desert where the lost play
soul searching each and every way
and then you see the
awesome sound so profound
when it- 
itll grip you
you can see it
if you hear it you can feel it too
something special i am running to
until then i go

away very far away
to another universe where all the people say
its the new new place 
for the special to embrace
like a martian who seemingly wandered out of place
take what you need from the valley of the hope
where even if you drowned youd be floating higher up
and you can say bye bye bye
sky might be falling but remember you can fly high

i sure bet my daddy proud
a little nigga wit a shaker smile
on top of the dreams is where im found

some figured i was satan bound
until i came back with a style i found
then all of the sudden they fixed their faces
cause of who i know and trail of places

that ive stepped
how many niggas wanna hate cause i left
how could you blame me and my plan of attack
cause im risking my soul attack
now im heard all over the map

only rule of thumb
it dont really matter just where you from
all that really matter is where youre gon go
maybe upstate for some

but you cant rule out these claps for gun
second chances given out for some
all you gotta do is take advantage
so maybe you can get yourself a horse and carriage
been pimpin you should think about marriage

until then get it then find yourself and lets begin
ima tell you how in a minute ima show you how i be livin
from a long time ago a young nigga he was timid
now im zone and see things so vivid

hide my soul nah homie not even
ima zone out till i lose feeling
remember ima be gone way past november
even stay up there up there
floatin floatin hopin i could find peace somewhere

in my mind it sounds like ooh
when im gone it feels like ooh

when im zone im feelin alright im feelin alright
im feelin alright
when im zone im feelin alright im feelin alright
i forget about it all

ballin is this allowed
without feelin like shallow hal
commas on the jesus piece for style
back in cleveland city we ride around

greetin my niggas wit dap and pounds
so if i fall i wont hit the ground
these are the things thatll make me smile
knowin this blunt might burn a while

i keep myself so lifted
i am accustomed to new heights
i feel perfect though they think its worthless
see without my flight

man everybody wanna be a critic
i have my life and i will live it
shut your mouth before i fuck it
ha my jokes they will love it

if im seen on the scene with my slim cut jeans
more than likely i am fadin man
doin other shit if everywhere you go
niggas aint just standin round hatin

so my advice is when the lights start flashin
ill be zonin all alone
and then the place where my mind is goin
filled with songs that no ones knowin

and the devil in a hot pink dress
tryin to ask me for one dance
he think he slick but my guardians
protect me from his wrath
so in my place no hate shall enter
livin high up there up there
copin copin floatin i will find peace somewhere

in my mind it sounds like ooh
when im gone it feels like ooh

when im zone im feelin alright im feelin alright
im feelin alright
when im zone im feelin alright im feelin alright
i forget about it all

in my mind it sounds like ooh
when im gone it feels like ooh

when im zone im feelin alright im feelin alright

i was born to do the damn thing
story of cudi nigga getting out my dreams
zero options to choose
living in a box full of cuyahoga boobs and listen
i stayed away from reading the plain dealer
most of my niggas back in cleveland were plain dealers uh
who whipped supremes the candy-painted eyes
but the love from the boppers had him watchin they rise
wasnt no love for a nigga in the smug
sipping out a cup a concoction for cruising
high off life my nigga not even
ima go to war with the devil til were even
bobbing and weaving spiritual hymn singing
no commentary my man i come out swinging
and this will be the song that we sing
any young nigga with visions when hes sleepingverse 1 kid cudi 
what up how is everyone doing 
you are now in the world i am ruling 
take a minute to adjust for the wondrous 
clusterfuck of fun and enchantment 
i promise you some generation next shit 
speak for the seller who i left with 
parallel levels in the dark dark place 
tripped all you niggas to a dark dark fate 
the guy that you are with a smile up on my face 
as the sun kisses us on the foreheads gently 
gentle with the drugs heavy with the love 
ima spit this on stage watch models fill my club 
g4 flights now were off to australia 
i wanna see more of the world 
these are more than just words these are facts from a winner 

chorus cee-lo green 
this is a journey into the horizon 
hope you can see that if its real to you 
we can meet on the other side 
on the other side

then we can meet on the other side 
on the other side 

verse 2 kid cudi 
what up how is everyone feeling 
i hope you understand what youre hearing 
take a minute to roll up for the wondrous 
clusterfuck of darkness and evil 
i will play the yin and the yang for ya 
and my jeans will be off with the little skinnies 
ugraded fitted into the t 
work hard make sure i dont become a memory 
hard to press on when the memories remember me 
and they always find the perfect moment 
high speed im a minimal slum 
lost in the wind ive lost all my friends 
maybe they were never meant to be acquainted 
money seems to make everything tainted 
everybody mad cause they stuck 
one less 
took what i wanted and i did it all blunted 
oh oh

i live through words not metaphors
so i passed to be the rest of the freshmen
playful tough talk
often the fave till i came to park heart
and said true things
a whole new legion of some n-ggas
aiming high pass the idea slangin
praise allah for keeping me awake man
i lot of my n-ggas fell victim to the dope game
some things will never be same
wish i could tell my brother something for some motivation
and get him out that gutter
he’s leaving behind a family and a mother
damn you must understand when i speak about a song its how i really am
yeah this is how i really think
you could see what i see yes i really wink
yes i really drink
i really do rage my demons at the cage
by most of the day before i became the age to even rage
i was drowning them sorrows with some more e n-gga

shades over my eyes
make the creepers look back at themselves
sitting stuck in emotional bliss
the skinny amount of girls with coke on their gums
tap my knee
im keepin the rythym
the young and wild take chances together
they all jump up twist and groove
but no one talks lost in the motherfuckin mood

no one talks lost in the mood
no one talks sweatin it out lost in the mood

hey theres a hunger in the night
the moonlight kissing the nips on the model frame
i kissed her inner thigh
closed my eyes she began to make me fit
she like to go the mile all the while
i can see her tear bit
i forgot her name

something that sounds like penelope
may be a french twang to it
tongue was quick she was french i knew it
a lovely foreigner foreign to racism
she like the young nigga by my brown skin
my shag dog fro
im king to her
she will please her friend for me
so funny and theyll starve in the garden
naked as always honest
her hands all over my privates
lost in the mood

no one talks lost in the mood
no one talks sweatin it out lost in the mood

but no one talks lost in the motherfuckin mood
no one talks lost in the mood
no one talks sweatin it out lost in the mood[kid cudi]

my brother told me a long time ago
dont focus where you been focus where you trying to go
i swear the game make you cold like obonimal
snow man old man when you trying to shine like gold
when its my time to blow partner imma know
in the mist getting dough i was here with highs and low
my melo tried to play me like my fucking eyes was closed
now im sittin here wishing that my guys didnt know
they love a g so they despise a soul
what they gon do to him beyond my control
when the reaper calls its your time to go
never play a nigga when you see that he is tying to grow
candy blocker when he knocked out 
empty chamber so im watching every angle
under the moonlight with he devil octangle
church on the move like jesus in the manger
better control the money its better to control the anger
so now i watch a friend the way i watch a stranger

[chorus]

[chip tha ripper]
chilling rolling up something to change my felling
thinkin about how i came up from nothing while im
splitting this cigarillo phone rings i get a call
one of my dogs tripping hard talkin about really killin them all
i say slow down slow down
what the fuck you mean nigga
just ran to your crib and popped your daughter in the spleen
ill be there in 20 minutes but it only took fifteen
we wasnt that tight but cool enough for me to hit the scene
no knowing that this was all a set up
secretly they want me wet up
jealous of my future cheddar however
they passes move was to slow for me
i pulled up wasnt no ambulance there wasnt no police
something fishy going on not even kept pressing on
nine gripped thinking the killer could still be on the lawn
opened the front door they shot i shot some abrupt shit
the nigga with something to lose almost lost it wont trust him again

[chorus]

[kid cudi]
cheese came through at 3
salute at ease he supplied the weed
cuz ive been that oded
its me with a black rockstar steed
will rock tees 300 a pop for these
please bum me you dont owe you money
they ignite got flipped i got blow for a grip
sipping on a heinie heineken with my jamie boo besides me
thats my fucking best friend
when i be tweaking she be calming a brother
like the touch from a mother
i am so damn comfortable i never want to leave it
the feeling is something like a spiritual healer
that could end me i think thats the part i find intriguing
a little bit off i am i am i am
i see that im caught i am i am i am
its something like a spiritual healer that could end me
i think thats the part i find intriguing im fiending

the beginnings are followed by an end
in the in-between time im not running or hiding

[bridge]
see things do come around
and make sense eventually
things do come around
but some things trouble me

[chorus]
the people ive met and the places ive been
are all what make me the man i so proudly am

im most confused about the world i live in
to think that im lonely well i probably am
one thing that still gets me
when did i become a ghost yeah

yeahh waahhhhh wahhhhh
yeahh waahhhhh wahhhhh

tried to fight it
but soon i gave in
down the road with no lights on
when you cant describe it
and you dont move like them
you become their worst nightmare
you remember the things that youre parents have said and
rather find out the hard way
you should tell a friend to tell a friend to tell a friend
i keep with my stroll im not running or hiding

i tried to tell all my friends when i was a kid that i had powers nobody wanted to believe me alright

spent the last month feeling bad ’bout myself
i couldn’t speak anything of real hope
and the day came when it hit me like lightning through my veins
a sudden change in my groove in my walk
i got my lion heart and electric flowing through my brain
shocking waves make me feel i can float
it’s like the city is mine and the dark is my cave
i can’t explain this sudden peace in my walk
i sure hope

i am living my life as if i had powers
and tonight i feel immortal
i said tonight i feel immortal
tonight i feel immortal

bet you want to see me weak
not sort of my thing you see
i’m too damn cool my mojo too dope
it’s the same old thing getting lost day ‘n’ nite young and lost in the pain
so many times i’ve broke this vicious cycle
i got my lion heart and electric flowing through my brain
shocking waves make me feel i can float
surely imma do what i want ain’t got no one to blame
i can’t explain this sudden peace in my walk
i sure hope

i’m living my life as if i had powers
and tonight i feel immortal
i said tonight i feel immortal

well known as a getter and a nigga with a plan
the nigga  so sad

we unified by the dark and middle fingers in air
come on who gon go half on a zone
oh thought i would be done off the coke no

been skeetin on pretty faces then my heart switched cold
been the nigga sittin in hell in fresh ass clothes
i know what it feels like to have a broken nose
and aint nobody hit you in it
its really cause that shit that you snorted and put all in it
that time you thought i was finished no i just experimented
and it helped me adjust and be ok with being demented

and most wanna relax someone tell me how that feel
i say that loud until i go an pop this pill
i say out loud you wanna let me cop a feel
now i pray out loud but i know my god ill
bounce with me if you dont give a fuck simply
fed up wont let up on the overtime
the more i work the more they wanna sweat mine
i can feel those lames they love to speak my name
sometimes dreams of breakin niggas whole faces
and fuck the precinct aint scared of catchin cases
sky might fall but i aint worried at all
got me some xannies and a couple adderall
plus these racks up on the strippers at the mall
with the spirit of god and some gandalf balls
lord of the sad and lonely
and the ones that feel like shit on the daily
dont let these phony niggas and hoes
be the ones that bring you low
let it be from the fatigue from making a pussy plead
all of the things ive seen and survived
make a nigga feel way more than just alive

i got my head on a swivel
think its time i open my mind where i left it
nigga make it easy
make sure that they cant delete me
im bout to be rewire your whole fucking mainframe
im sick of the same
lame old same thing
i got some bubonic you might wanna mix with some whiskey
i got a vendetta with showing niggas that im way better
feeling way worthless
the lost black sheep of good music
only good for a hook huh
let me show you flows
intuitive when it comes to many things i know
cold
most winters i would dream of being a winner
feeling like less than shit to the doubters
pain i promise to all who oppose my knowledge
my reign
