whattup g saw my face on tv
damn oh shit i didnt know i lucked out
struck out i gotta get the fuck out
pack my bags and tried to hit the door when
the ol bitch down the street mustve turned me in
cos the feds was out there ten deep
i got hassled and gaffled in the back seat
i think back when i was robbin my own kind
the police didnt pay it no mind
but when i start robbin the white folks
now im in the pen wit the soap-on-a-rope
i said it before and ill still taunt it
every motherfucker with a colour is most wantednow the taste of alcohol is filling up my bladder
whats the date and time it dont matter
had a pocket full of phone numbers i was trying to sort
to make a long story short
ran into this girl named carla
knew her from the back seat of my homies impala
she said whats up yeah whats the deal
check the hairdo of course it aint real
then i looked down she was fat in the front
i asked how long well about seven months
oh how time flies when youre having fun
she said yeah but the damage is done
where you been on a little vacation
oh by the way congratulations
whos the lucky man i dont have a clue
then she said the lucky man is you
i dropped my brew
and everything looked fuzzy
not a baby by you the neighborhood hussy
she said yeah remember that date
i thought back and tried to calculate
then i said damn are you sure its mine
cause i know you been tossed plenty of times
she said that day no i wasnt whoring
your ass is mine thats when the sweat started pouring
cause all i saw was ice cube in court
paying a gang on child support
then i thought deep about giving up the money
what i need to do is kick the bitch in the tummy
naw cause then id really get faded
thats murder one cause it was premeditated
so what im a do
i dont have a clue
how many months left damn only two
im gettin faded

no cigar g
ay yo homey man im getting faded

its crazy cause before i could sleep with her
i had to duck and dodge and try to creep with her
see the booty and the front was all in place
but the girl had the pitbull face
so we ran jumped drove swam crawled hid
oh lord god forbid
my homies see me at the motel
cause those fools would love to just go tell
everybody in the hood that knows your rep
so jump in the back seat and quiet is kept
and hold your big fat butt steady
cause yo hoe i got the paper bag ready
she started moaning and gobbling like a turkey
i knocked the boots from here to albuquerque
i dropped her off man and im knowing
that im a hate myself in the morning
i got drunk to help me forget
yo another day another hit shit
im gettin faded

ay yo you know what time it is

nine months later shes ready to drop the load
and everybody in the hood already knows
its supposed to be mine so they laughing at me
you know ice cube cant be having that g
im thinking to myself why did i bang her
now im in the closet looking for the hanger
jd and jinx and t-bone wont let up they wont shut up
im gettin fed up bitch
cause i know youre tryin to break me
but if i find out your tryin to fake me
im a buff that duff for a hoot
beat ya down and leave a crown or two
that night she went into labor
and the shit is getting kinda major
the baby came out damn it was a lifesaver
looking like my next-door neighbor
she said it was mine that was her best guess
but lets check the results of the blood test
i started smiling yeah cause it read negative
damn why did i let her live
after that i shouldve got the gat
and bust and rushed and illed and peeled the cap
but no i just told the hoe who laid me
excuse me bitch its a switch
you cant fade me

naw baby not this way
yo you aint playing ice cube out like no booger
i dont fall for the okey-doke
and before i fall for the okey-doke
i let the pistol smoke
now sing it
yeah baby you cant fade me
naw unfadable babyonce upon a time in the projects yo
i damn near had to wreck a ho
i knocked on the door - who is it 
its ice cube come to pay a little visit to ya
and whats up with the niggers in the parking lot
she said fuck em cause they get sparked alot
i sat on the couch but it wasnt stable
and then i put my nikes on the coffee table
her brother walked in hes into gangbangin
cause he walked up and said what set you claimin
i dont bang i write the good rhymes
the whole scenery reminded me of good times
i hate to feel bad but im in a rut
by a young nigga that needs to pull his pants up
her mother came in with a joint in her mouth
and fired up the sess it was sess no doubt
she said please excuse my house and all that
i said yeah cause i was buzzed from the contact
lookin at a fucked up black and white
her moms bitchin cause the county check wasnt right
she had another brother that was three years old
and had a bad case of the runny nose
he asked me who i was then i had to pause
it smelled like he took a shit in his little drawers
i saw her sister that needs get her ass kicked
only thirteen and already pregnant
i grabbed the forty out the bag and took a swig
cause i was getting overwhelmed by bebe kids
they were runnin and playin and cursin and yellin
and tellin and look at this young punk bailin
i heard a knock on the door without the password
and her moms got the 12 guage mossberg
the nigga said yo whats for sale
and the bitch came out with a bag of ya-yo
she made the drop and got the 20 dollars
from a smoked out fool with ring around the collar
the girl i was waiting for came out
i said bitch i didnt know this was a crack house
i got my coat and suddenly 
police breaking into house annoucing themselves
the cop busted in and had a mac-10 pointed to my dome
and i said to myself once again its on
he threw me on the carpet no slap jumped back
stomped on my head and put his knee in my back
first he tried to wrap me up slap me up rough me up
they couldnt do it so they cuffed me up
i said fuck how much abuse can a nigga take
hey yo officer youre making a big mistake
since i had on a shirt that said i was dope
he thought i was selling base and couldnt hear my case
he said get out my face i musta had a grudge
his reply tell that bullshit to the judge
the girl i was with wasnt sayin nothin
i said aiyyo bitch you better tell em somethin
she started draggin and all of a sudden
we all got tossed in the patty wagon
now i beat the rap but that aint the point
i had a warrant so i spent 2 weeks in the joint
now the story you heard has one little object
dont fuck with a bitch from the projectsturn on the radio take a listen
what youre missing
personally im sick of the ass-kissing
what im kicking to you wont get rotation
nowhere in the nation
program directors and djs ignored me
cause i simply said fuck top forty
and top thirty top twenty and top ten
until you put more hip-hop in
then i might grin but dont pretend that youre down with the c
and go and dis me in a magazine
how could you figure the brother could dig ya
dj face down in the river
no its not a threat but a promise
im as
crazy as they come see
mama didnt love me
all i got is my nine
and to calm the savage beast heres the alpine

turn off that bullshit
turn off that motherfucking radio
turn off that bullshit
turn off that motherfucking radio
turn off that bullshit
play the music motherfucker put the music on
damn

tune in to the radio listen for a minute
yo g stick a fucking tape in it
cause all the radio do is gangle
that r&amp;b love triangle
if youre out there kicking it with the brothers
you dont care about lovers
you wanna hear a young nigga on the mic
going buck wild
throwing and flowing and showing new styles
thats where im coming from
reality thats what theyre running from
so if youre down with ice cube let me know that you know
yo turn off the radio

you know what you know what 
basically those black guys and those rap guys
they dont know what the fuck theyre doing
i hate those fuckers
i hate em
especially that one guy
the amerikkkas most wanted
ice cube--i hate that fucker
get him off the air get him off get him off
get that rap shit out of here
just get me a gat so i can smoke this motherfuckerverse one ice cube

peace - dont make me laugh
all i hear is motherfuckers rappin sucotash
livin large tellin me to get out the gang
im a nigga gotta live by the trigger
how the fuck do you figure
that i can say peace and the gunshots will cease
every cop killer goes ignored
they just send another nigga to the morgue
a point scored- they could give a fuck about us
they rather catch us with guns and white powder
if i was old theyd probably be a friend of me
since im young they consider me the enemy
they kill ten of me to get the job correct
to serve protect and break a niggas neck
cuz im the one with the trunk of funk
and fuck tha police in the tape deck
you should listen to me cuz theres more to see
call my neighborhood a ghetto cuz it houses minorities
the other color dont know you can run but not hide
these are tales from the darkside

verse two

you wanna free africa i stare at yuh
cuz we aint got it too good in america
i cant fuck with them overseas
my homeboy died over a key of cocaine
it was plain and simple
the 9mm went &lt;pop&gt; to the temple
&lt;pop pop pop&gt; was the sound i put the bitch down
and ran to the schoolyard bathroom
looked in the trash can yo it had room
so i ducked my ass in it for a minute
covered with trash i had to lay back
mad as fuck thinkin about the payback
tonite the crew gonna have a little fun
i went home and cut the barrel of my shotgun
its gettin critical - i stole a 50
i let it go - drive real slow
i yelled out ice cube sucka
the shot-gun kicked - and it murdered motherfuckers
i told you last album
when i got a sawed off bodies are hauled off
its a shame that niggas die young
but to the light side it dont matter none
itll be a drive by homicide
but to me its just another tale from the darkside

verse three chuck d

standing in the middle of war
in the middle we flex
when we die we wont make +jet+
+ebony+ cant see to the lightside
the term they apply to us is a nigga
call it what you want cause im comin from the coroner
sayin my rhymes with a phd
whos black - dont wanna role - sells his soul
watch his head go rollin
who the fuck are they foolin
nobody knows but i suppose the color of my clothes
matches the color of the one on my face
as they wonder whats under my waist
[standin on the verge] of them gettin brown
thats a fact got a fear on their bozack
run run run their ass off they can not hide
yet cube they cant fuck with the darksideintro little russ ice cube

little boys and girls they all love me 
come sit on the lap of i-c-e 
and let me tell ya a story or two 
about a punk-ass nigga i knew 
named jack he wasnt that nimble wasnt that quick 
jumped over the candlestick and burnt his dick 
ran up the street cause he was piping hot 
met a bitch named jill on the bus stop 
dropped a line or two and he had the hoe 
at that type of shit hes a pro 
so jack and jill ran up the hill to catch a lil nap 
dumb bitch gave him the claps 
then he had to go see dr bombay 
got a shot in the ass and he was on his way 
to make some money why not 
down on sesame street the dope spot 
there he saw the lady who lived in a shoe 
sold dope out the front but in back marijuana grew 
for the man that was really important 
who lived down the street in a air jordan 
ride to the fellow mister rogers and hoes 
drove a 500 sittin on lorenzoes 
he broke out little bo peep smoked out 
saw her and her friends sellin sheepskins 

[little bo peep] yo yo i got them sheepskins

verse two ice cube 

humpty dumpty sat on a wall 
with a joint drinkin some 8-ball

theyre fucked up and they want revenge 
them and humpty used to be friends 
now theyre enemies cause hes a traitor 
pulled out the uzi cruised by and sprayed him 
cinderella hoeing for the fellas 
and mister rogers is gettin mighty jealous 
of the cash that the pigs were makin 
time for the pigs to get turned to bacon 
cause mister rogers found out quick 
that humpty dumpty was blown to bits 
they said that the motherfuckin wolf was next 
so mister rogers better watch his step 
so he let the wolf know 
were gonna fuck up the pigs and take their ho 
cause cinderella is much too fast 
before twelve givin up ass 
double barrels all loaded and cocked 
as soon as they show they gonna get popped 
they bailed down sesame street and caught em 
little boy blue is up front givin orders 
little did they know cinderella was a fink

its just another ice cube groupie test
shes a hoe cause they knew her at the front desk
told her to meet me at the room 110
and the bitch showed up with her boyfriend
i let him in all he could do was grin
he had a camera a t-shirt a pad and pen
he said yo ice cube can you sign this 
i only did it cause his bitch was the finest
she blew me a kiss and gave a bitter frown
like - how can we get rid of this clown 
me and her sat down he got a little jealous
cause his punk ass sat in the middle of us
and he asked me question after question
it felt like a motherfuckin interview session
then his girl got up i heard the do shut
and he was still there swingin from my nuts
i said get the fuck out and made it loud and clear

[tom brokaw newcaster sample]
outside the south central area
few cared about the violence because it didnt affect themyou cant fuck with the criminal rapping over gangsta shit
first i load the clip and then i make the hit
i know some yall cant fade this
lench mob niggas are the craziest
so you and your boys are ass-out
when im rollin in a seven-deuce glass house
the mob aint nothing but a menace
when we get the motherfucking dog in us
playing them old beats
im pouring out some of my beer for my homies
ready to peel your cap
you cant believe faces of death on wax
some say the mob aint positive
man fuck that shit cause i gots to live
how i live and you could either give a fuck punk
yo or get your ass bucked
some rappers are heaven-sent
but self-destruction dont pay the fucking rent
so you can either sell dope or get your ass a job
id rather roll it wit the lench mob

to be down with the mob is simple
mind your own you want a spot find your own
and take mine if youre badder than the strong man
i do the right thing i do the wrong thing
do anything cause i aint faking the scene
its all about how much bacon you bring
and if you see something from the gat i will stuff it
yo you aint seen nothing
cause if you testify youre living blind
cause in the city you live and let die
rolling with the fools one time cant beat
on my knees in the street interlock my hands and feet
he said i know you i said you might
my name is ice cube i did a song you didnt like
so he soaked me up like bounty
had to do a week in the county
a piece of cake it was just like a party
cause in the county you know everybody
no i didnt kill or steal or rob
locked up for what cause im rollin wit the lench mob

if you know a female thats rollin with the lench mob
watch your step cause the gat is kept
in the purse like my homegirl yo-yo
you gotta be down and you cant be a hoe no
cause if you are ill be the first one to bust you out
after my crew ill be the first one to rush you out
get the picture or bitch
youll get the eighty-six
if she wanna try and mix
business and pleasure make up your own mind
you gotta be a hoe on your own time
dont sleep cause even on a solo creep
yo the mob is still deep
and well play ya just like a nit-wit
you thought you got with the crew you cant get with
so get the noose ready for the lynching
now 235 is what im benching
but nowadays its still not enough
i got something guaranteed to stop the bum rush
give me the gat step back and watch me do the job
rolling with the motherfucking lench mobwomen theyre good for nothing no maybe one thing
to serve needs to my ding-a-ling
im a man who loves the one-night stand
cause after i do ya
huh i never knew ya
cause to kick it man it gives me the fits
they wanna lay with they nose under your armpits
ice cube wont wait so give it up cow
after we do it you can go home now
im a brother with a big long

yo-yo
first of all let me tell you my name its yo-yo
when down on a girl first the fist and thats a no-no
yo-yo thinks the kitchen sink should be thrown in
niggas be scheming and fiending to stick the bone in
no yo-yos not a hoe or a whore
and if thats what youre here for
exit through the door
theres more
to see of me but youre blind so
women like me are fading brothers in the 9-0

ice cube
ay what up buttercupper miss yo-yo
i know you like to rap and like to flow so
but when it comes to hip-hop this is a mans world
stay down and play the playground you little girl

yo-yo
what youre saying i dont consider it as rapping
cause youre on rewind and im the new whats-happening
it never fails ill always get respect
and you lose so take a rain check

ice cube
hell no cause you know that im first and youre second
if it wasnt for me you probably be pregnant
and barefoot complaining that your back is aching
shaking and faking while im bringing home the bacon

yo-yo
well youre mistaken
its not going that far
i make brothers like you play the back yard
you used to flow with the title but i took it
bring home the bacon but find another hoe to cook it

ice cube
damn it look it
cause youre talking a lot of bull

yo-yo
well im not your puppet so dont even try to pull

ice cube
this is a mans world thank you very much

yo-yo
but it wouldnt be a damn thing without a womans touch

break

ice cube
ah miss yo-yo so what gives
i hear females always talkin about womens lib
well get your own crib
and stay there
instead of having more babies for the welfare
cause if you dont ill label you a gold digger
the name is ice cube you know that i aint the nigga
for you to look at when your hair get nappy
so take a piece of the pole and be happy

yo-yo
hell no because to me youre not a thriller
you come in the room with your three-inch killer
thinking you can do damage to my backbone
leave your child in the yard until its full-grown
im a put it like this my man
without us your hand would be your best friend
so give us credit like you know you should
if i dont look good you dont look good

ice cube
i doubt it baby cause were still most dominant

yo-yo
but you dont know how funky that i can get

ice cube
this is a mans world thank you very much

yo-yo
but it wouldnt be a damn thing without a womans touch

break

ice cube
man women i put a lot of fear in em
cause i had it up to here with em
drink a beer with em
no way cause i can only deal with em about an hour every day
yeah if you know what i mean baby

yo-yo-
well i guess now that i think about it i think maybe
if you was more of a man instead of faking it
women deserve the credit when theyre making it

ice cube
yeah so whats the problem

yo-yo
well i think we solved it
i know they know the best male from whos doggin it

ice cube
yeah i admit you can flow

yo-yo
well thats true

ice cube

the brand-new intelligent black lady

ice cube
youre kinda dope but you still cant fade me

yo-yo
so what up then

ice cube
girl what you tryin to do

yo-yo
to prove a black woman like me can bring the funk through

ice cube
this is a mans world thank you very much

yo-yo
but it wouldnt be a damn thing without a womans touch

ice cube
or a big buttits like a holocaust to the boss when i toss
too much knowledge kicked then youre lost
in a shuffle of feet jinx the fiddler
and i control your mind like hitler
you bow and vow to authority
see now a sucker with a style just boring me
so i show know
ledge it might trouble you
then i transform like a decepticon
with a mic as a bomb
in my right palm
but i dont stay calm
so panic
others cant flow so they go schizophrenic
you thought i dropped a dud in your face
until you taste the blood of the bass
then you faint or better yet pass out
when im on the mic believe its ass out
you think youre raw so you draw
you lose youre hung you bite your tongue
the whole town saw in awe as you strangle
a noose on your neck and you dangle
from side to side in the blazing heat
youre beat youre dead the fools fell off
you feel youre turning red its said
that your head burst
and this is only the first verse
of the bomb

break

dont break up the fight let them rumble
over the years ive watched some go super-bad quick
now the smell of the pen has got them sick to the stomach
now ask yourself whos stupid 
i take funky funky beats and i loop it
and pimp slap you in the face with the bass
and the boom from the bomb that i drop
stop
you have a flat top as a fashion
i love black women with a passion
but when they gotta go and show their ass in
i gotta clown the hoes yeah
you gotta watch the ones with the big derrieres
theyll steer you wrong
ice cubes got it going on hit me
for the gangster boogie two times for the gangster rhyme
the system aint wholesome
they want to put a young brother in folsom
and others see me on lockdown
but i come up foul then they get knocked out word
to the brother that rolls the herb
everybody getting knocked to the curb like that
jinx got the gat and its a fact
hell kick a funky beat to peel your cap
now whos the mack 
whos the hoe 
whos the trick 
i got many many styles wont you take a pick
but dont be alarmed
when i trip and stumble and fumble
and drop the rewind
drop the bomb

break

im solo you ask how im living
still dropping more shit than a pigeon
with the l the e the n the c the h
the m the o the b the great
lyrics that make the beat swing and i gotcha
its the hip-hopper that dont like coppers
and if you try to upset the pot son
you get kicked in the chest like a shotgun
i make the beats i make the breaks
i make the rhymes that make you shake
make you find
ice cube never caught in the middle
i make shit to kick you in the ass a little
and still never hesitate to stutter step
or bust a repitition on the mic
still dissing all the hype
from left to right
how many left to fight 
so what that lench mob likeverse one ice cube

peace - dont make me laugh
all i hear is motherfuckers rappin sucotash
livin large tellin me to get out the gang
im a nigga gotta live by the trigger
how the fuck do you figure
that i can say peace and the gunshots will cease
every cop killer goes ignored
they just send another nigga to the morgue
a point scored- they could give a fuck about us
they rather catch us with guns and white powder
if i was old theyd probably be a friend of me
since im young they consider me the enemy
they kill ten of me to get the job correct
to serve protect and break a niggas neck
cuz im the one with the trunk of funk
and fuck tha police in the tape deck
you should listen to me cuz theres more to see
call my neighborhood a ghetto cuz it houses minorities
the other color dont know you can run but not hide
these are tales from the darkside

verse two

you wanna free africa i stare at yuh
cuz we aint got it too good in america
i cant fuck with them overseas
my homeboy died over a key of cocaine
it was plain and simple
the 9mm went &lt;pop&gt; to the temple
&lt;pop pop pop&gt; was the sound i put the bitch down
and ran to the schoolyard bathroom
looked in the trash can yo it had room
so i ducked my ass in it for a minute
covered with trash i had to lay back
mad as fuck thinkin about the payback
tonite the crew gonna have a little fun
i went home and cut the barrel of my shotgun
its gettin critical - i stole a 50
i let it go - drive real slow
i yelled out ice cube sucka
the shot-gun kicked - and it murdered motherfuckers
i told you last album
when i got a sawed off bodies are hauled off
its a shame that niggas die young
but to the light side it dont matter none
itll be a drive by homicide
but to me its just another tale from the darkside

verse three chuck d

standing in the middle of war
in the middle we flex
when we die we wont make +jet+
+ebony+ cant see to the lightside
the term they apply to us is a nigga
call it what you want cause im comin from the coroner
sayin my rhymes with a phd
whos black - dont wanna role - sells his soul
watch his head go rollin
who the fuck are they foolin
nobody knows but i suppose the color of my clothes
matches the color of the one on my face
as they wonder whats under my waist
[standin on the verge] of them gettin brown
thats a fact got a fear on their bozack
run run run their ass off they can not hide
yet cube they cant fuck with the darksideintro

ice cube and the lench mob is jackin for beats

verse three

about a bitch is a bitch is a hoe is a slut
and i dont like niggaz on my nuts
so i dedicate this one to the groupie
and the charlie all on my snoopy
brothers keep askin ice cube yo when will you bust
they surround me and make a big fuss
now i was taught back on my block
that you dont ride on nobodys jock
for anything they do fuck him and his crew
unless you were gettin paid too
im not saying this to diss each and every fan
women you can ride man be a man
shake my hand and make it a firm shake
say whattup ice cube  and then break
cause if youre hangin there ima tell you loud and clear
get off my my dick nigga and tell your bitch to come here

* cut n scratch of flavor flav saying stay off his dick
and ice cube saying all on my snoopy *

* cut n scratch of flavor flav saying yo yo check this out
and ice cube saying ima tell you loud and clear *

[ice cube]
motherfucker back up off me
im not signin no autographs im not givin no free t-shirts
and im not havin none of this bullshit youre talkin
youknowhatimsayin 

get off my dick nigga and tell your bitch to come here

i step into the club to rub-a-dub
it seems like all the little hoes fall in love
with my money cause yo about a year ago
i was just your ordinary average everyday crazy ass bro
but you know i just cant be equal
cause they know i know a lot of famous people
but to a one-night stand theres no sequel
heres the pickle pretend its a popsicle
see for a fat booty i do damage
they think im a star so i take advantage
its just another ice cube groupie test
shes a hoe cause they knew her at the front desk
told her to meet me at the room 110
and the bitch showed up with her boyfriend
i let him in all he could do was grin
he had a camera a t-shirt a pad and pen
he said yo ice cube can you sign this 
i only did it cause his bitch was the finest
she blew me a kiss and gave a bitter frown
like - how can we get rid of this clown 
me and her sat down he got a little jealous
cause his punk ass sat in the middle of us
and he asked me question after question
it felt like a motherfuckin interview session
then his girl got up i heard the do shut
and he was still there swingin from my nuts
i said get the fuck out and made it loud and clear
get off my dick nigga and tell your bitch to come here

i see me about ten mark ass motherfuckers fans
knock on the door talkin about whassup 

yo man it was about a hundred and twenty dicks man
niggaz start niggaz comin out of hotel rooms
without no bitches

they can get gaffled like they in a motherfuckin raffle
punk ass

[ice cube]
yo i respect the respectable
if your girl is all on my dick check the hoe
say yeah that nigga he can rap fly
but you know stars are up in the sky
cause all i got is hard dick and bubblegum
just ran out my last stick is where im comin from
im not tellin you to diss mr ice cube
cause you know im the one that can show and prove
now groupie girls i just make em wait
but the groupie boys i cant tolerate
i hate it so much ima start givin stitches
to the niggaz thats starin like bitches
cause im not a fairy a mary or a faggot
gimme the eye ill fly and tag it
now you see jockin aint healthy
cause you think that im young and im wealthy 
with juice so i see you try to run behind
but ima tell you punk you gets none of mine
cause i was taught see a fool use a fool
by the niggaz who terrorized the old school
so dont try me or buy me a beer
just stay off my dick nigga * echoes *i was told cause i didnt witness the whole act
in and out was the movement of the bozack
it was hot and sweaty and lots of pushin
then the nut came gushin
and it was hell tryin to bail to the ovary
with nuttin but the lord lookin over me
i was white with a tail
but when i reached the finish line young black male
one cell made two and two cells made fo
and so on so now im a embryo
then i got a hunch
that ima be on lockdown for nine months
chillin with my mother to guide me
and nuttin but a stomach to hide me
from all that worry and bullshit
nine months later i elbow pull and kick
cause my time is up and i dont care
with one big push im outta there
june 15th its just my luck
in 1969 a nigga is the product

ghetto ass nigga you aint shit
and you aint gon never be shit

i learned how to walk and talk and all that
they put me in school but it dont matter
cause im sittin in history
learnin bout a sucker who didnt give a fuck about me
they try to shape us
but i know uncle sam is a motherfuckin rapist
so i stopped payin attention
ice cube headed straight to detention
fuck that shit i roam the hallways
im sent home and i dont got all as
a high school dropout
my father had beef so i tried to knock pops out
but i got tossed hes the boss
im out of there and mad cause i lost
now bein on my own is a factor
so i become the neighborhood jacker
gimme your car run your jewels
makin a livin robbin fools
and if i let my nine rang out
you know itll make your brains hang out
so whats your fate
am i the nigga you love or the one you love to hate
the wrong answer is said the nigga fled
i pump lead now hes in a puddle of red
and if you got a buck youre shit out of luck
stuck up by the motherfuckin product

uh-uh motherfucker you gots to get a job
if you wanna stay in my motherfuckin house

many young men reject the traditional values
that are important to their parents
church school and family
have been replaced by street turf and gang

twenty-one now and paid in full
feelin bad from all the shit i pulled
on people back in the day
plus i got a little baby on the way
so im tryin to go straight
im with my babys momma out on a date
til the punk ass cops ran my plate
now im on a bus upstate

oh the young nigga done caught a case
sittin in the mess hall sayin my grace -&gt; ll cool j

sent to a concrete hoe-house
where all the products go no doubt
yo momma i gotta do eleven
livin in a five by seven
dear baby your mans gettin worn out
of seein young boys gettin they assholes torn out
and then he got shanked with a spoon
and he was sposed to get out soon
is it my fault he was caught in production
where a young black life means nothin
just because i didnt want to learn your grammar
you say im better off in the slammer
and its drivin me batty
cause my little boy is missin daddy
im ashamed but the fact is
i wish pops let me off on the mattress
or should i just hang from the top bunk
but thats goin out like a punk
my life is fucked
but it aint my fault cause im the motherfuckin product

he aint shitverse one

up early in the morning dressed in black
dont ask why cause im down in a suit and tie
they killed a homie that i went to school with damn
i tell ya life aint shit to fool with
i still hear the screams of his mother
while my nigga laid dead in the gutter shit
and its getting to my temple
why is that the only time black folks get to ride in a limo
it makes me so mad i want to get my sawed-off
and have some bodies hauled off
but no i pay my respects and im through whaddup cube
hug my crew and maybe shed a tear or two
and i wanna get blitz
grab my 40 ounce and then i reminisce
about a brother who had to be the one and only
so i dedicate this to my dead homiez

verse two

another homie got murdered on a shakedown {three gun shots}
and his mother is at the funeral havin a nervous breakdown
two shots hit him in the face when they blasted {two gun shots}
a framed picture and a closed casket
a single file line about 50 cars long
all drivin slow with they lights on
he got a lot of flowers and a big wreath
what good is that when youre six feet deep
i look at that shit and gotta think to myself
and thank god for my health
cause nobody really ever know
when its gonna be they family on the front row
so i take everything slow go with the flow
shut my motherfuckin mouth if i dont knowword
cause thats what pops told me
but i wish he could have said itto my dead homiez

verse three

i remember we painted our names on the wall for fun
now its rest in peace after every one
except me but i aint the one to front
seems like im viewin a body after every month
plus i knew him when he was yea big
pour beer on the curb before i take a swig
but somethin aint right
and its a tragedy thats the only time that the familys tight
lovin each other in a caring mood
theres lots of people and lots of food
they say be strong and youre tryin
but how strong can you be when you see your pops cryin
so thats why ice cubes dressed up
because the city is so fuckin messed up
and everybody is so phony
take a little timeto think about your dead homiez[j dee]
police eat the dick straight up; you know why
i got jacked just the other night
this motherfucker gon tell me
what im doing walk in the streets
man what the fuck you mean what im doin walk in the streets

everytime i try to steal one you take me to jail

last person in the world you wanna fuck with repeat 3x[airline attendant]
this is the final boarding call for flight 1259
departing from los angeles final destination to st louis
thank you

[ice cube]
damn g the spots gettin hot
so how the fuck am i supposed to make a knot
police looking at niggaz through a microscope
in la everybody and they momma sell dope
they trying to stop it
so what the fuck can i do to make a profit
catch a flight to st louis
thats cool cause nobody knew us
we stepped off the plane
four gang bangers professional crack slangers
rented a car at wholesale
drove to the ghetto and checked in a motel
unpacked and i grabbed the 380
cos where we staying niggaz look shady
but they cant fade south central
cos busting a cap is fundamental
peeping out every block close
seeing which one will clock the most
yeah this is the one no doubt
bust a u bone and lets clear these niggaz out

hey hey man whassup nigga
this is lynch mob nigga tires squeal

now clearing them out meant casualties
still had the la mentality
bust a cap and outta there in a hurry
wouldnt you know a drive-by in missouri
them fools got popped
took their corner next day set up shop
and its better than slanging in the valley
triple the profit making more than i did in cali
breaking up rocks like barney rubble
cos them mark-ass niggaz dont want trouble
and we aint on edge when we do work
police dont recognize the khakis and the sweatshirts
getting bitches and they cant stand a 
1991 tony montana
now the shits like a war - gang violence 
where it was never seen before
punks run when the gats bust
4 jheri curled niggaz kicking up dust
and some of them are even looking up to us
wearing our colors and talking that gang fuck 
giving up much much love
dying for a street that they never heard of
but other motherfuckers want to stand strong
so you know the phrase once again its on

[tv newscaster]
at the top of the news tonight
a gang from south central los angeles which are known for their drive-by shootings
have migrated into east st louis leaving 3 dead and 2 others injured no arrests have
been made police say this is a nation-wide trend with similar incidents occurring in
texas michigan and oklahoma

female voice repeating in background
if it can happen here it can happen anywhere

fresh out of school cause i was a high school grad
gots to get a job cuz i was a high school dad
wish i got paid like i was rappin to the nation 
but thats not likely so heres my application
pass it to the man at at&amp;t
cuz when i was in school i got the a e e
but theres no sc for this youngsta
i didnt have no money so now i have to hunch the
back like a slave thats what be happenin 
but whitey says theres no room for the african 
always knew that i would boycott jeez
but welcome to mcdonalds can i take your order please
gotta sell ya food that might give you cancer
cuz my baby doesnt take no for an answer
now i pay taxes that you never give me back 
what about diapers bottles and similac 
do i gotta go sell me a whole lotta crack
for decent shelter and clothes on my back
or should i just wait for help from bush
or jesse jackson and operation push 
if you ask me the whole thing needs a douch
a masengel what the hell cracker sale in the neighborhood 
to the whorehouse bitches
miss porker little joe or todd bridges
or anybody that he know 
so i got me a bird better known as a kilo
now everybody know i went from po to a nigga that got dough
so now you put the feds against me
cause i couldnt follow the plan of the presidency
im never givin love again
cuz blacks are too fuckin broke to be republican 
now i remember i used to be cool
till i stopped fillin out my w-2
now senators are gettin hired
and your plan against the ghetto backfired 
so now you got a pep talk 
but sorry this is our only room to walk
cause we dont want a drug push
but a bird in the hand is worth more than the bush

tell the politicians the hustlers live and let live yeah
tell the politicians the hustlers live and let live yeahheres another topic im addressing
so learn a quick lesson about your smith and wesson
sit your ass back and comprehend
as i let you know about mans best friend
now remember it used to be a dog like lassie
but now in 91 its a gun if you ask me
just like a jimmy hats used for protection
i use my nine when suckers start to flex it
cause if you run up and try to play mine
i rather have a ak than a fucking k9
cause if you shot your gun and my dog tries to fetch ya
me and the dogs going out on a stretcher
and i aint with that so i gotta get that
big black gat aim and i hit that
forget about a dog fool hell shit in the   
nowadays a gat is mans best friend

mans best friend

verse two
here is the reason why ice cubes packed
just in case the little punks try to jack
i cant put a motherfucking pitbull under a coat
and a small on my back
so i gotta take my beret off and i betcha
itll probably work a 100 percent better
cause itll keep me out of danger
with sixteen in the clip and one in the chamber
so this goes to all yall intruders
beware of the owner cause the owner is a shooter
i dont just wanna give your ass rabies
i rather have your ass pushing up daisies
and i cant do that with benji
rin tin tin or spotch mckinsey
forget about a dog fool hell shit in the   
nowadays a gat is mans best friend

just dont let me see you shoot no dogs
hey i got shots fired here send me another unit
the profile of a typical american gun owner is this
over thirty white male middle class -- peter jennings
take that motherfuckersdown at the best spot
its me and jd and they sellin more birds than a pet shop
the spots hot and everybody nervous
thats when the blue car served us
oh why did fools had to let loose
heard six pops from a deuce deuce
big tom had to push us
13 niggaz runnin straight to the bushes
for they gats so they could draw down
but why a motherfucker like me had to fall down
not known why i dropped out
fuck it still cant afford to get popped out
so now i gotta jet
only ran one block but my shirt soakin wet
tryin to see if we got him
looked down at my sweatshirt red at the bottom
didnt panic but i still looked cracked out
yelled to the homies then i blacked out

woke up in the back of a tray
on my way to mlk
that the county hospital jack
where niggaz die over a little scratch
still sittin in the trauma center
in my back is where the bullet entered
yo nurse im gettin kind of warm
bitch still made me fill out the fuckin form
coughin up blood on my hands and knees
then i heard freeze nigger dont move
yo i didnt do a thing
didnt wanna go out like my man rodney king
still got gaffled
internal bleeding as the bullet starts to travel
now im handcuffed
being asked information on my gang affiliation
i dont bang i rock the good rhymes
and im a victim of neighborhood crime

i need to see a md
and yall mothafuckers giving me the third degree
look at the waiting room
its filled to the rim like the county jail day room
nobody gettin help
since we poor
the hospital move slow
now im layed out
people steppin over me to get closer to the tv
just like a piece of dog shit
now will i die on this nappy ass carpet
one hour done passed
done watched two episodes of m*a*s*h
and when im almost through
they call my name and put me on icu
halfway dead
no respect and handcuffed to the bed
now the trauma starts
cause the bullet must be just a hair from my heart
so i begin the ass kissin
just to get looked at by an overworked physician
got the chills but my temperatures 103
only got a band-aid and an iv
thats when i start cussin
police steady askin me who did the bustin

why oh why cant i get help
cause im black i gots to go for self
too many black bodies the hospital housin
so at 10 pm i was audi 5000damn we burn up niggas
feeling fucked by lench mob niggas
dont be a bitch girl
it is a fuckin death bitch[heart monitor beeps in the background]

the black father and mother of morality medicine music and mathematics
the father and mother of all the nation of religion philosophy art science and civilization
no further
all they can say about the black man
is he was hes hears and he shall be
before him there were none
and after him there will be no more
before we can make a way for the peace maker
we must kill and get rid of the peace breaker [beat fades-out]i wanna kill sam

the army is the only way out for young black
teenagers
well provide you with housing well provide you
with education
well provide you with everything you need to
provide a life
well help you to be the best soldier in the us
of a

cause we do more before 7 am
than most niggers to their whole life time

im coming im coming im coming im coming

verse one
i wanna kill him cause he tried to play me like a
trick
but you see im the wrong nigga to fuck wit
i got the a to the motherfucking k and its ready
to rip
slapped in my banana clip
and im looking
is he in watts oakland philly or brooklyn 
it seems like he got the whole country behind him
so its sort of hard to find him
but when i do gotta put my gat in his mouth
pump seventeen rounds make his brains hang out
cause the shit he did was un-called for
tried fuck a brother up the ass like a small whore
and that shit aint fly
so now im setting up the ultimate drive-by
and when you hear this shit
it makes the world say damn i wanna kill sam

momma some man at the front door
uhm hi ive got reasons to believe that someone
in this household
has just turned eighteen am i correct 

verse two
this is why i wanna kill the punk
cause he tried to take a motherfucking chunk of
the funk
he came to my house i let em bail in
cause he said he was down with the lm
he gave up a little dat
then turned around and pulled out a gat
i knew it was a caper
i said please dont kill my mother so he raped
her
tied me up took me outside
and i was thrown in a big truck
and it was packed like sardines
pull of niggers who fell for the same scheme
took us to a place and made us work
all day and we couldnt have shit to say
broke up the families forever
and to this day black folks cant stick together
and its odd broke us down made us pray to his
god
and when i think about it
it makes me say damn i wanna kill sam

verse three
now in 91 he wanna tax me
i remember the son of a bitch used to axe me
and hang me by a rope till my neck snapped
now the sneaky motherfucker wants to ban rap
and put me on the dirt or concrete
but god can see through a white sheet
cause youre the devil in drag
you can burn your cross while i burn your flag
try to give me the hiv
so i can stop making babies like me
and youre giving dope to my people chump
just wait till we get over that huh
cause your ass is grass cause im a blast
cant bury rap like your buried jazz
cause we stop being whores stop doing floors
so bitch you can fight your own wars
so if you see a man in red white and blue
getting chased by the lench mob crew
its a man who deserves to buckle
i wanna kill sam cause he aint my motherfucking
uncleintro

you are the prince of darkness
arch enemy father of evil
hell born demonic savage fierce viscious wild
tameless barbaric uncontrollabe obstinate beast

verse one

horny little devil you gotta back up
horny little devil you cant bust a nut
lookin at my girlfriends black skin
you wanna jump in but she dont like white men
so dont throw that work you fuckin jerk
or get your punk devil ass hurt motherfucker
she aint with the pale face
cause yall fuck at a snails pace 
and you might get sprayed with mace 
by the ebony
so when shes doing her job you better let her be
dont try to pinch the gluterus
thinkin that you about to knock out the uterus
cause shell tell you to kiss her ass quick
and where im from devils get their ass kicked
mr sexual harrasment 
asking for a blow while the answer is fuck no
looks like you wanna terminate 
but thats when i go psycho like norman bates
i wanna kill the devil for talkin shit
cause he cant get a taste of the chocolate
african breast; cause white bitches got no butt and no chest
black women have bodies like goddesses
sorta like venus but put away your penis
cause the devil is a savage motherfucker
thats why im lighter than the average brother
cause you raped our women and we felt it
but itll never happen again if i can help it me neither
cause nobody in my neighborhood has caught jungle fever yet
so horny little devil you better listen
before your ass comes up missin
and its like that

verse two

now you wanna get me 
horny little must be a f-a-g
tryin to fuck me out my land and my manhood
got broke eating spam and canned goods
locking down on my neighborhoods
treat me less than a man cause right now you got the upper hand
but my ass is a virgin
you mignt have fucked the indians
but you cant surgeon me 
and when im on top i wont be fuckin ya
id rather put a buck in ya
cause i hate the devil with a passion
and when i see the whites of his eyes i start blastin
dig a hole and throw his ass in 
and i wont be happy til im down to my last ten
get his fuckin pitchfork
tie him up and then feed the bitch pork
little devil wanna fuck me out my pay
but horny little devil true niggaz arent gay 
and you cant play with my yo-yo
and definitely cant play with me you fuckin homo
cause well blow your head off
and turn that white sheet into a red cloth
plus when theyre all dead 
i can quit that jheri juice and get a bald head
then let it nap up 
go down to the corner store and beat the jap up
clean all the crap up 
out my city 
now the whole block look shitty
put his dick on a wood block
swing swing swing and chop chop chop
now whos the next to nut
color me badd but you cant sex me up 
so dont even try to put a dick in a die
because this is what why in 1991 ima get my gun
put an end to the devil so get a fucking shovel

dont you know they aint down with the team
they just sent they boss over
put a bug in your ear and now you crossed over
on mtv but they dont care
theyll have a new nigga next year
you out in the cold
no more white fans and no more soul
and you might have a heart attack
when you find out the black folks dont want you back
and you know whats worse 
you was just like the nigga in the first verse
stop selling out your race
and wipe that stupid-ass smile off your face
niggas always gotta show they teeth
now im a be brief
be true to the game

break

but youre quick to point the finger at me
you wanna be the big fish you little guppy
black man cant be no yuppie
you put on your suit and tie and your big clothes
you dont associate with the negroes
you wanna be just like jack
but jack is calling you a nigga behind your back
so back off genius
i dont need you to correct my broken english
you know thats right
you aint white
so stop holding your ass tight
cause you cant pass
so why you keep trying to pass 
with your black ass
mister big
but in reality youre shorter than a midge
you only got yourself to blame
get a grip oreo and be true to the game

and ice cube practices what he preaches
he continues to live in south central los angeles
and he puts his money into projects that improve the neighborhood

be true to the gameice cube
heres another day at the stoplight
im lookin in my mirror so i can see who can see me
south central is puttin ice cube to the test
with four brothas in the ss
now i cant go around and cant back up
so i gotta peep game layin in the cut
is this a jack or a kidnap 
since im never ever slippin im fully strapped
i grab my gat out the glove
do these fools got a problem with me or do they got love 
and when the light turn green i dont bone out
i wanna see what these black men are all about
cuz if its my time im just short
if not im pluggin they super sport
first they get behind my ride
then they switch lanes to the left side
im scopin out the one smokin indo
comin up fast rollin down his window
he threw up a sign i put away my nine
fool cuz im color blind

threat
killa cali the state where they kill
over colors cuz brothas dont know the deal
and theyll cap you not if they have to
but if they want to first they might confront you
but every nigga on my block cant stop
and he wont stop and he dont stop
not to the bang bang boogie but they like to gangbang
and rookies aint the only ones that drop
some say the little locs are gettin a little too loced
and when it comes to dust they kick up the most
say the wrong words then whistle down the street to your homies like a bird
bust a u-turn come back and get served nigga
for the women it dont matter how loud they blouse get
but wearin the wrong color outfit could get your mouth split
its a shame but it aint no thang to me
cuz i slang these thangs like a g
its on is anybody killin for the summertime
i gotta get another nine even though im colorblind

kam
im fresh outta county on bail
and no sooner do i get out seems like im right back in jail
for some gang related activity
cuz everyday different fools try to get with me
for no more than a color or territory
cant rehabilitate em thats the sheriffs story
so whats left the judge goes deaf
when you try to tell your side and you aint blue eyed
boy you better duck cuz the book is comin
and just hand your car keys over to your woman
because it aint no sunshine where you headed
and the shitll drive you crazy if you let it
but now i got time to think
because they hit me with everything but the kitchen sink
and i aint even shed a tear
cuz believe it or not they got more love for me here
now picture that but on a black and white photograph
cuz brothas you dont know the half
on the streets i was damn near outta my mind
but ever since ive been down im colorblind

wc

yo spotted the enemies now im on a creep tip
hit the 5 dollar stick and i put in my clip

coolio
so i jumped out the car and no matter what the cost
i had my mind set on sendin niggaz to harrisons ross

wc
caught one from the back and i looked in his eyes
thinkin should i peel his cap or should i let him survive
yo im trapped in the plan designed by the other kind

coolio
i aint contributin to genocide why  cuz i was colorblind

king tee
niggaz in the hood aint changed
and ive finally figure out that were not in the same gang
cuz i walk the alleys of compton with nowhere to turn
every which way i get burned baby
lou wears blue big fred wears red
put em together and we color em dead
dead dyin gettin smoked like part of the fun
they get smoked just to show how many come to the funeral

j-deelench mob
i understand how all my homeboys feel
cuz ive been shot and to this day i pack my steel
cuz i was born in a certain territory
where you dont talk only the streets tell stories
with blue and red bandanas on the street
and if youre slippin youll be six feet deep
cuz me and t-bone we pay it no mind
and for the rest of the mob we stay color blind&lt;oshea  oshea
get your ass in here boy
you hear me calling you
oshea&gt;

when i was young i used to hang with the seventh graders
little bad motherfucker playing space invaders
fucking with the girls in the fourth grade
either feeling on they butts or pulling on they braids
walking with the schoolhouse bully
by doing that i had a lot of pull g
cheating on tests making a mess
cussing like a sailor at recess
it must a been a half moon
cause youll catch me running out the little girls bathroom
chewing on good and plenties
got my gamble on at lunch pitching pennies
yo i was living like the class clown
pulling all the hokes making all the jokes man
when you young its hard to see
that its wrong throwing rocks at the rtd
popping out your window with a bb gun
better yet knocking on your door and run
playing hide-and-go-get-it for a little stank
even though i was still shooting blanks
as soon as the dark hit
i was stealing candy out the corner market
until i got my ass whipped
cause i was ten years old doing dumb shit

thirteen thats how old i was
when my jimmy started getting a little peach fuzz
and i was looking at any butt and ass
me and my homies started cutting class
going up to the high school
looking for any bitch i could lie to
tell em i was older than i really was
smoked my first joint and got really buzzed
thats what a macks made of
but when i got my first piece of pussy i fell in love
hard as a rock the long way
and then i put the rubber on the wrong way
but i still gotta have it
overexcited and fucking like a jackrabbit
goddamn i was hot
a virgin but i still knew how to lay pipe
even though the hoe worked me
i still knocked the boots from here to albuquerque
then the shit got strange money
i started shaking and jimmy felt funny
then the nut came gushing
i jumped up got dressed and start pushing
cause i thought the bitch broke my dick
cause i was still young doing dumb shit

at 17 got my first volkswagon
and mastered the life-long art of dragging
to the women in college
hung out with the ogs and got some street knowledge
breaking in cars and all that
hitting punk fools with a baseball bat
fucking at a real fast rate
til they said that i might not graduate
then i said fuck the dumb shit
cause popsll fuck me up quick
if things continued
so i start rapping about shit i been through
and i got real good
now i look at all the kids in the neighborhood
trying to be baby macks
doing shit that i did seven years back
going through a stage
but before they can grow up they on the front page
and they mommas is having a fit
cause they died young doing dumb shicould you tell me who released our animal instinct 
got the white man sittin there tickled pink
laughin at us on the avenue
bustin caps at each other after havin brew
we cant enjoy ourselves
too busy jealous of each others wealth
commin up is just in me
but the black community is full of envy
too much back-stabbin
while i look up the street i see all the japs grabbin
every vacant lot in my neighborhood
build a store and sell their goods
to the county of sips  
you know us po niggas nappy hair and big lips 
four or five babies on your crotch
and you expect uncle sam to help us out 
we aint nothin but porchmonkeys
to the average bigot redneck honky
you say comin up is a must
but before we can come up take a look at us

verse two

and all yall dope-dealers
your as bad as the po-lice- cause ya kill us
you got rich when you started slangin dope
but you aint built us a supermarket
so when can spend our money with the blacks
too busy buyin gold an caddilacs
thats what ya doin with the money that ya raisin
exploitin us like the caucasians did
for 400 years - i got 400 tears- for 400 peers
died last year from gang-related crimes
thats why i got gang-related rhymes
but when i do a show ta kick some facts
us blacks dont know how ta act
sometimes i believe the hype man
were messin up ourselves and blame the white man
but dont point the finger you jiggaboo
take a look at yourself ya dumb nigga you
pretty soon hip-hop wont be so nice
no ice cube just vannilla ice
and yall sit and scream and cus
but theres no one ta blame- but us

verse three

us  will always sing the blues
cause all we care about is hairstyles and tennis shoes
but if ya step on mine ya pushed a button
cause ill beat you down like it aint nothin
just like a beast
but im the first nigga ta holler out {peace black man}
i beat my wife and children to a pulp
when i get drunk and smoke dope
got a bad heart condition
still eat hog-mogs an chitlins
bet my money on the dice and the horses
jobless so im a hope for the armed forces
go to church but they tease us
wit a picture of a blue-eyed jesus
they used to call me negro
after all this time im still bustin up the chiffarobe
no respect and didnt know it
and im havin more babies than i really can afford
in jail cause i cant pay the mother
held back in life because of my color
now this is just a little summary
of us but yall think its dumb of me
to put a mirror to ya face but trust
nobody gives a fuck aboutfuck all yall

goddamn im glad yall set it off
used to be hard now youre just wet and soft
first you was down with the ak
and now i see you on a video with michelle
lookin like straight bozos
i saw it comin thats why i went solo
and kept on stompin
while yall muthaphukkaz moved straight outta compton
livin with the whitez
one big house and not another nigga in sight
i started off with too much cargo
dropped four niggaz now im makin all the dough
white man just rulin
the niggaz with attitude -- who ya foolin
yall niggaz just phony
i put that on my mama and my dead homiez
yella boys on your team so youre losin
aiyo dre stick to producin
callin me arnold but you benedict
eazy e saw your ass and went in it quick
you got jealous when i got my own company
but im a man and aint nobody helpin me
tryin to sound like amerikkkas most
you could yell all day but you dont come close
cause you know im the one that flown
ya done run 100 miles but you still got one to go
with the l-e-n-c-h m-o-b
and yall disgrace the c-p-t
cause youre gettin fucked out your green
by a white boy with no vaseline

[refrain]
ll sample now youre gettin done without vaseline  3x
biz markie sample damn it feels good to see peopleon it

and eazys dick is smellin like mc rens shit
tried to tell you a year ago
but willie d told me to let a ho be a ho
so i couldnt stop you from gettin ganked
now lets play big-bank-take-little-bank
tried to diss ice cube it wasnt worth it
cause the broomstick fit your ass so perfect
cut my hair and ill cut them balls
cause i heard youre like givin up the drawers
gang-banged by your manager fella 
gettin money out your ass like a muthaphukkin ready teller
givin up the dollar bills
now they got the villain with a purse and high-heels
so dont believe what ren say
cause hes goin out like kunta kinte
but i got a whip for ya toby;
used to be my homie 
now you act like you dont know me
its a case of divide-and-conquer
cause you let a jew break up my crew
house nigga gotta run and hide
yellin compton but you moved to riverside
so dont front mc ren
cause i remember when you drove a b210
broke as a motherfuckin joke they let you on the scene
to back up the verse team

and they rippin your asshole apart
by takin your green
oh yeah --- the villain does get fucked with no vaseline

[refrain scratched]  

i never have dinner with the president---

fuckin mc ren dr dre and yella
but if they were smart as me
eazy-e would be hangin from a tree
with no vaseline ---

light em up burn em up flame on
till that jheri curl is gone
on a permanent vacation
off the massa plantation

dumb nigga what you thinkin bout
get rid of that devil real simple
put a bullet in his temple
cause you cant be the niggaz4life crew 
with a white jew tellin you what to do
pullin wools with your scams;

by mista shitpacker
bend over for the goddamn cracker
no vaselineand now the wonderous world of
hey come to los angeles
you and your family can have peace and tranquility
enjoy the refinement
hey bone hey nigga where you at though 
hello my name is elaine --
and ill be your tour guide through south central los angeles

[ice cube]
how to survive in south central what you do 
a place where bustin a cap is fundamental
no you cant find the shit in a handbook
take a close look at a rap crook
rule number one get yourself a gun
a nine in your assll be fine
keep it in your glove comparment
cause jackers yo they love to start shit
now if youre white you can trust the police
but if youre black they aint nothin but beasts
watch out for the kill
dont make a false move and keep your hands on the steering wheel
and dont get smart
answer all questions and thats your first lesson
on stayin alive
in south central yeah thats how you survive

hi this is elaine again
are you enjoying your stay in south central los angeles
or is somebody taking your things have you witneesed a driveby 
okay make sure you have your camcorder ready
to witness the extracurricular activities on blacks by the police
so you and your family can enjoy this tape over and over again
this is los angeles this is los angeles

[ice cube]
rule number two dont trust nobody
especially a bitch with a hookers body
cause it aint nuttin but a trap
and femalesll get jacked and kidnapped
youll wind up dead
just to be safe dont wear no blue or red
cause most niggaz get got
in either la compton or watts
pissed-off black human beings
so i think you better skip the sight-seeing
and if youre nuttin but a mark
make sure that youre in before dark
but if you need some affection mate
make sure the bitch aint a section eight
cause if so thats a monkey-wrench hoe
and you wont survive in south central

now you realize its not all that its cracked up to be
you realize that its fucked up
it aint nothin like the shit you saw on tv
palm trees and blonde bitches 
id advise to you to pack your shit and get the fuck on;
punk motherfucker

and you need your ass straight smoked
yo i wanna say whassup to dj chilly chill
sir jinx aiyyo cube these motherfuckers dont know what time it is
so show these motherfuckers whats happenin
tell these motherfuckers dont fuck around in south central
god damnit

[ice cube]
rule number three dont get caught up
cause niggaz are doing anything thats thought up
and they got a vice
on everything from dope to stolen merchandise
we discern
cause south central la is one big yearn
waitin for a brother like you to catch a disease
and start slangin kis
to an undercover or the wrong brother
and theyll smother a out of town motherfucker
so dont take your life for granted
cause its the craziest place on the planet
in la heroes dont fly through the sky of stars
they live behind bars
so everybodys doin a little dirt
and its the youngsters puttin in the most work
so be alert and stay calm
as you enter the concrete vietnam
you say the strong survive
shit the strong even die in south central

yeah you bitches you think i forgot about your ass
you tramp-ass hoes you better watch out
and for you so called baller-ass niggaz
you know what time it is south central aint no joke
got to keep your gat at all times motherfuckers
better keep one in the chamber and nine in the clip god damnit
youll sho get got just like that
this aint no joke motherfuckers
now i wanna send a shout-out to e-dog the engineer
puttin his two cents in

this is los angeles[heart monitor beeps in the background]

[ice cube] how you doin

[female interviewer male]
good to see you
well known that the crips and the bloods are allegedly coming together
yeah youve been alot in the media lately than other rappers wed mentioned earlier cube that uhm
you know you have been labelled a lota thing
what do you say to the people with the causal being anti-semitic fuck em
or anti-careerist
and basically a portrait of the violence because of your lyrics what do you say to them fuck em
its probably the reason why they say that its beacause some of the lyrics were
aimed at the women bitches and hoes and all that
i wanna talk a little bit about that too
because we saw the parents discussion about this last time and yeah
so and brothers uhm folks walkin around totin guns uuuuhm
all that kinda stuff do you think that sometimes those images and those lyrics
help white folks justify their continual racism againts us or continue racism against us nah

[ice cube]
i-i speak in a perpective as uh brothers on
what we need to do is look in the mirror
i-i i do want the white community to understand our community more
and see whats going on and see what what uh the things theyve done to us in the past
are still affectin us now mentally you know
and the reason i said its because i mean everything i said about uh uuuhm you know
everything i said on records before the riots you know uuuh uh-hmm

was in the records before the riots all you had to do was go
to the ice cube library and and and

im speaking as a black man from america which is a racist society
no matter how much you hear it talk about democracy
its as racist as south africa or as racist as portugal
or as racist as any other racialist society on this on this earth
the only difference between it and south-africa south-africa
preaches separation and practices separation
america preaches integration and practices segregation
this is the only difference
they dont practice what they preach
for in south-africa preaches and practices the same thing
i have more respect for a man who let me know where he stands
even if hes wrong
then one who comes up like an angel and is nothing but a devil

[minister louis farrakhan on the donahue show 1991]
i uhm i dont agree with him because i dont have to follow anyone to defend myself
i think that uhm there are every people uhm
all people have been frustrated in some form from another
but uhm
i dont agree with him i dont follow a man and i dont think anyone should follow one man
i think they should follow their conscience
i think the most of them most negroes that they feel sorry for themselves
and i think that this keep some that uhm
much more than they would be
if they didnt feel so sorry for themselves

if martin luther king roy wilkins or any of these uuh
compromising negroes who say exactly what the white man wants to hear
is interviewed anywhere in the country you dont get anybody to offset what they say
but whenever a black man
stands up and says something that
white people dont like then the first thing that white man does
is run around and try and find somebody to say something
to to uuhm offset
what has just been said
this is natural
but it is done

heheheh remix

just waking up in the mornin gotta thank god
i dont know but today seems kinda odd
no barkin from the dogs no smog
and momma cooked a breakfast with no hog
i got my grub on but didnt pig out
finally got a call from a girl i wanna dig out
hooked it up for later as i hit the do
thinkin will i live another twenty-fo
i gotta go cause i got me a drop top
and if i hit the switch i can make the ass drop
had to stop at a red light
lookin in my mirror and not a jacker in sight
and everything is alright
i got a beep from kim and she can do it all night
called up the homies and im askin yall
which park are yall playin basketball
get me on the court and im trouble
last week messed around and got a triple double
freakin brothers everyway like mj
i cant believe today was a good day

thats right

creep to the pad and hit the showers
didnt even get no static from the cowards
cause just yesterday them fools tried to blast me
saw the police and they rolled right past me
no flexin didnt even look in a brothers direction
as i ran the intersection
went to $hort dogs house they was watchin yo mtv raps
whats the haps on the craps
shake em up shake em up shake em up shake em
roll em in a circle of homies and watch me break em
with the seven seven-eleven seven-eleven
seven even back do lil joe
picked up the cash flow
then we played bones and im yellin domino
plus nobody i know got killed in south central la
today was a good day

hehe

left my homies house paid
picked up a girl been tryin to do since the twelve grade
its ironic i had the brew she had the chronic
the lakers beat the supersonics
felt on the big fat fanny
pulled out the jammy and killed the punanny
and my jimmy runs deep so deep
so deep put her butt to sleep
woke her up around one
she didnt hesitate to call ice cube the top gun
drove her to the pad and im coastin
took another sip of the potion hit the three-wheel motion
i was glad everything had worked out
dropped her butt off and then chirped out
today was like one of those fly dreams
didnt even see a berry flashin those high beams
no helicopter lookin for the murder 
two in the mornin got the fatburger 
even saw the lights of the goodyear blimp
and it read ice cubes a pimp
drunk as hell but no throwin up 
half way home and my pager still blowin up
today i didnt even have to use my ak
i gotta say it was a good day* originally appeared as a b-side to cubes wicked single

mr dirty harry you look really scary
with your 357 officer kevin
spent 11 years on the force trying to get mine
head got the flat top boots got the spit shine
dont give a fuck about my neighborhood
just wanna do your eight hours then hit the showers
shoot a brother down adn you dont send flowers
goddamn sherrif cant wait to tarriff
a chunk of a nigga ass but watch a nigga blast
and get away nigga fast
you aint gonna have me face down no more
you aint gonna have a chance to clown no more
to the boys in blue i got kids too
aint going out like a jigaboo no no no
on my way to the store
you see me in a range rover now you gotta pull me over
but where oh where is the ticket
you got your hand on your gun cause youre wicked
you dont like the face of the original man
but you gotta treat me like an individual man
talk right and ill talk right back
show some goddamn respect to the black
cause i gotta get back to my wife
but im sorry you aint gonna take my life

just because you got a badge
did you think ice cube was gonna wave the white flag
cracker please you can yell freeze
id rather die standing up than die on my knees
you think you can do anything you want to do
to my crew when you come through man fuck you
shooting up south central
catch your ass slipping at a rent show
could have popped you off one dead cop
but i know you got a wife and a dog named spot
i show a little mercy cause im civilized
looking through a niggas eyes at a much bigger prize
but when i saw rodney it got me so hot
made me wanna go out and pop me a cop
cause every time you see me sagging
here comes the grand dragon in the motherfucking patty wagon
try to play me like a trick
sometimes you act like a dick mr nightstick
back then i used to throw my mack-10
but nowadays you got the black skin
back then you dont like the voice of a nigga named ice
but you aint gonna take my life

you man lets get an understanding
i know that your job is demanding
but i only got me one life to live
you only got about six shots to give
and i got a big ak with a 50-round clip
so why should we trip
you aint gonna punk me so what you trying for
aint no job worth dying for is it
might pay a visit to petey wheatstraw
when you stop me on the shore officer of the law
and if i did something wrong you can lock me up
never never never gonna sock me up
so next time you have the urge all of the sudden
to fuck with a nigga for nothing
think about me a brother thats 23
i got a son and a j-o-b
so before you pull your gun youd better think twice
pig cause you aint gonna take my life[ice cube]
microphone check heh yo
heh yeah

	{they wont call me a nigga} - 2x

listen to the preacher man but are you talkin to me
i cant hear you with a mouth full of pigs feet
thy shouldnt eat the swine flesh
your body is a mess but youre blessed
with the father son spirit and the holy ghost
but my whole neigborhood is comatose
lookin for survival
the devil made you a slave and he gave you a bible
400 years of gettin our ass kicked
by so-called christians and catholics
but ima watch em burn in the fire
see im a g thats why i aint in your choir
cause i see cause i know
the church aint nuttin but a fashion show
get the devil do a one-eighty-seven
and they wont call me a nigga when i get to heaven

	{they wont call me a nigga}
	{when i get to heaven}
	{no they wont  haha no they wont no they wont}

youre waitin for the devil to come from the ground
clown take a look around
just look at the cross that the priest is holdin
a beast in sheeps clothing
but im rollin with that knowledge of self
cause heaven aint just wealth
so mister preacher if i couldnt pay my tithe
do i have to wait outside
white man please take another look
cause we couldnt be readin out the same book
cause youse a crook and im a brother
king james had sex with his mother
is that yo edition is that your religion
black man you gotta make a desicion
cause god is comin on day number seven
and they wont call me a nigga when i get to heaven

	{they wont call me a nigga}
	{when i get to heaven}
	{no they wont  haha no they wont no they wont}
	{they wont call me a nigga}
	{when i get to heaven}
	{no they wont  haha no they wont no they wont}

the same white man that threw me in the slammer
he bombed the church in alabama
so if i cock the hammer god wont mind
if i have to kill the human swine
cause god is a killer from the start
why you think noah had to build his ark
and god is a man from his feet to his hair
thats why you say amen after each and every prayer
i just stare at the church man
spendin mo money on the church band
but elijahs got a plan
got the white man screamin - damn that farrakhan
cause one day these babiesll uprise
much more than bow ties and bean pies
kickin knowledge at the 7-11
and they wont call me a nigga when i get to heaven

	{they wont call me a nigga}
	{when i get to heaven}
	{no they wont  haha no they wont no they wont}

peace - dont make me laugh
all i hear is motherfuckers rappin sucotash
livin large tellin me to get out the gang
im a nigga gotta live by the trigger
how the fuck do you figure
that i can say peace and the gunshots will cease
every cop killer goes ignored
they just send another nigga to the morgue
a point scored- they could give a fuck about us
they rather catch us with guns and white powder
if i was old theyd probably be a friend of me
since im young they consider me the enemy
they kill ten of me to get the job correct
to serve protect and break a niggas neck
cuz im the one with the trunk of funk
and fuck tha police in the tape deck
you should listen to me cuz theres more to see
call my neighborhood a ghetto cuz it houses minorities
the other color dont know you can run but not hide
these are tales from the darkside

verse two

you wanna free africa i stare at yuh
cuz we aint got it too good in america
i cant fuck with them overseas
my homeboy died over a key of cocaine
it was plain and simple
the 9mm went &lt;pop&gt; to the temple
&lt;pop pop pop&gt; was the sound i put the bitch down
and ran to the schoolyard bathroom
looked in the trash can yo it had room
so i ducked my ass in it for a minute
covered with trash i had to lay back
mad as fuck thinkin about the payback
tonite the crew gonna have a little fun
i went home and cut the barrel of my shotgun
its gettin critical - i stole a 50
i let it go - drive real slow
i yelled out ice cube sucka
the shot-gun kicked - and it murdered motherfuckers
i told you last album
when i got a sawed off bodies are hauled off
its a shame that niggas die young
but to the light side it dont matter none
itll be a drive by homicide
but to me its just another tale from the darkside

verse three chuck d

standing in the middle of war
in the middle we flex
when we die we wont make +jet+
+ebony+ cant see to the lightside
the term they apply to us is a nigga
call it what you want cause im comin from the coroner
sayin my rhymes with a phd
whos black - dont wanna role - sells his soul
watch his head go rollin
who the fuck are they foolin
nobody knows but i suppose the color of my clothes
matches the color of the one on my face
as they wonder whats under my waist
[standin on the verge] of them gettin brown
thats a fact got a fear on their bozack
run run run their ass off they can not hide
yet cube they cant fuck with the darksidewomen theyre good for nothing no maybe one thing
to serve needs to my ding-a-ling
im a man who loves the one-night stand
cause after i do ya
huh i never knew ya
cause to kick it man it gives me the fits
they wanna lay with they nose under your armpits
ice cube wont wait so give it up cow
after we do it you can go home now
im a brother with a big long

yo-yo
first of all let me tell you my name its yo-yo
when down on a girl first the fist and thats a no-no
yo-yo thinks the kitchen sink should be thrown in
niggas be scheming and fiending to stick the bone in
no yo-yos not a hoe or a whore
and if thats what youre here for
exit through the door
theres more
to see of me but youre blind so
women like me are fading brothers in the 9-0

ice cube
ay what up buttercupper miss yo-yo
i know you like to rap and like to flow so
but when it comes to hip-hop this is a mans world
stay down and play the playground you little girl

yo-yo
what youre saying i dont consider it as rapping
cause youre on rewind and im the new whats-happening
it never fails ill always get respect
and you lose so take a rain check

ice cube
hell no cause you know that im first and youre second
if it wasnt for me you probably be pregnant
and barefoot complaining that your back is aching
shaking and faking while im bringing home the bacon

yo-yo
well youre mistaken
its not going that far
i make brothers like you play the back yard
you used to flow with the title but i took it
bring home the bacon but find another hoe to cook it

ice cube
damn it look it
cause youre talking a lot of bull

yo-yo
well im not your puppet so dont even try to pull

ice cube
this is a mans world thank you very much

yo-yo
but it wouldnt be a damn thing without a womans touch

break

ice cube
ah miss yo-yo so what gives
i hear females always talkin about womens lib
well get your own crib
and stay there
instead of having more babies for the welfare
cause if you dont ill label you a gold digger
the name is ice cube you know that i aint the nigga
for you to look at when your hair get nappy
so take a piece of the pole and be happy

yo-yo
hell no because to me youre not a thriller
you come in the room with your three-inch killer
thinking you can do damage to my backbone
leave your child in the yard until its full-grown
im a put it like this my man
without us your hand would be your best friend
so give us credit like you know you should
if i dont look good you dont look good

ice cube
i doubt it baby cause were still most dominant

yo-yo
but you dont know how funky that i can get

ice cube
this is a mans world thank you very much

yo-yo
but it wouldnt be a damn thing without a womans touch

break

ice cube
man women i put a lot of fear in em
cause i had it up to here with em
drink a beer with em
no way cause i can only deal with em about an hour every day
yeah if you know what i mean baby

yo-yo-
well i guess now that i think about it i think maybe
if you was more of a man instead of faking it
women deserve the credit when theyre making it

ice cube
yeah so whats the problem

yo-yo
well i think we solved it
i know they know the best male from whos doggin it

ice cube
yeah i admit you can flow

yo-yo
well thats true

ice cube
but you see im a pro with the bank too

yo-yo
yeah i can see you got it good

ice cube
oh that i know

yo-yo
but you see youre not better than yo-yo
the brand-new intelligent black lady

ice cube
youre kinda dope but you still cant fade me

yo-yo
so what up then

ice cube
girl what you tryin to do

yo-yo
to prove a black woman like me can bring the funk through

ice cube

cause if they are	we gots to be who we be
and make a star	out of a head enemy
the papers said	that he died tragically
they found his head	with no legs and bo-dy
we made a pledge	to the dub-s-c
bloodshed		if they got no love for peace
sing it

chorus

verse three ice cube

id rather break bread than uhh break your head
break your legs have em broken i aint no joke
dont provoke the gun smoke from the highest slope
eternal peace for my peoples and my folks
my crips and my bloods criminals and my thugs
just show a nigga love when im rollin on them dubs
just give a nigga hugs we can ride on this piece
westside for life but still down with the east
sing it

chorus 2x

	after the haters attempt to blow up his car
	we find our hero ice cube on the ground

[chorus]once upon a time in the projects yo
i damn near had to wreck a ho
i knocked on the door - who is it 
its ice cube come to pay a little visit to ya
and whats up with the niggers in the parking lot
she said fuck em cause they get sparked alot
i sat on the couch but it wasnt stable
and then i put my nikes on the coffee table
her brother walked in hes into gangbangin
cause he walked up and said what set you claimin
i dont bang i write the good rhymes
the whole scenery reminded me of good times
i hate to feel bad but im in a rut
by a young nigga that needs to pull his pants up
her mother came in with a joint in her mouth
and fired up the sess it was sess no doubt
she said please excuse my house and all that
i said yeah cause i was buzzed from the contact
lookin at a fucked up black and white
her moms bitchin cause the county check wasnt right
she had another brother that was three years old
and had a bad case of the runny nose
he asked me who i was then i had to pause
it smelled like he took a shit in his little drawers
i saw her sister that needs get her ass kicked
only thirteen and already pregnant
i grabbed the forty out the bag and took a swig
cause i was getting overwhelmed by bebe kids
they were runnin and playin and cursin and yellin
and tellin and look at this young punk bailin
i heard a knock on the door without the password
and her moms got the 12 guage mossberg
the nigga said yo whats for sale
and the bitch came out with a bag of ya-yo
she made the drop and got the 20 dollars
from a smoked out fool with ring around the collar
the girl i was waiting for came out
i said bitch i didnt know this was a crack house
i got my coat and suddenly 
police breaking into house annoucing themselves
the cop busted in and had a mac-10 pointed to my dome
and i said to myself once again its on
he threw me on the carpet no slap jumped back
stomped on my head and put his knee in my back
first he tried to wrap me up slap me up rough me up
they couldnt do it so they cuffed me up
i said fuck how much abuse can a nigga take
hey yo officer youre making a big mistake
since i had on a shirt that said i was dope
he thought i was selling base and couldnt hear my case
he said get out my face i musta had a grudge
his reply tell that bullshit to the judge
the girl i was with wasnt sayin nothin
i said aiyyo bitch you better tell em somethin
she started draggin and all of a sudden
we all got tossed in the patty wagon
now i beat the rap but that aint the point
i had a warrant so i spent 2 weeks in the joint
now the story you heard has one little object
dont fuck with a bitch from the projectsice cube

departing from los angeles final destination to st louis
thank you

[ice cube]
damn g the spots gettin hot
so how the fuck am i supposed to make a knot
police looking at niggaz through a microscope
in la everybody and they momma sell dope
they trying to stop it
so what the fuck can i do to make a profit
catch a flight to st louis
thats cool cause nobody knew us
we stepped off the plane
four gang bangers professional crack slangers
rented a car at wholesale
drove to the ghetto and checked in a motel
unpacked and i grabbed the 380
cos where we staying niggaz look shady
but they cant fade south central
cos busting a cap is fundamental
peeping out every block close
seeing which one will clock the most
yeah this is the one no doubt
bust a u bone and lets clear these niggaz out

hey hey man whassup nigga
this is lynch mob nigga tires squeal

now clearing them out meant casualties
still had the la mentality
bust a cap and outta there in a hurry
wouldnt you know a drive-by in missouri
them fools got popped
took their corner next day set up shop
and its better than slanging in the valley
triple the profit making more than i did in cali
breaking up rocks like barney rubble
cos them mark-ass niggaz dont want trouble
and we aint on edge when we do work
police dont recognize the khakis and the sweatshirts
getting bitches and they cant stand a 
1991 tony montana
now the shits like a war - gang violence 
where it was never seen before
punks run when the gats bust
4 jheri curled niggaz kicking up dust
and some of them are even looking up to us
wearing our colors and talking that gang fuck 
giving up much much love
dying for a street that they never heard of
but other motherfuckers want to stand strong
so you know the phrase once again its on

[tv newscaster]
at the top of the news tonight
a gang from south central los angeles which are known for their drive-by shootings
have migrated into east st louis leaving 3 dead and 2 others injured no arrests have

texas michigan and oklahoma

facell be full of those tattooed tears
its the same old story and the same old nigga stuck
and the public defender aint givin a fuck

talkin about a double life plea bargain
you got to deal with the crips and bloods by hand g
plus the black guerilla family
and the white pride dont like northside
and its a riot if any more niggaz die
no parole or probation
now this is a young mans summer vacation

infra red aimed at your head
like your name was sarah conner
decapitatin i aint hesitatin
to put you in the funderal home
with a bullet in your dome

i got a problem solver
and his name is revolver

and your frozen inside a boddy bag

cap peeler

[ice cube]
terror illistrates my era

when i open you up
cause your body is exposed to the midnight mist
all you weak motherfuckers give my ring a kiss
cause im givin dirt naps
comin with them bomb ass raps
to make your lungs collapse
perhaps you never sleep
cause evertime you doze
you catch blows to the motherfuckin nose
aint seen the sun in 66 days

so you and your family can enjoy this tape over and over again
this is los angeles this is los angeles

[ice cube]
rule number two dont trust nobody
especially a bitch with a hookers body
cause it aint nuttin but a trap
and femalesll get jacked and kidnapped
youll wind up dead
just to be safe dont wear no blue or red
cause most niggaz get got
in either la compton or watts
pissed-off black human beings
so i think you better skip the sight-seeing
and if youre nuttin but a mark
make sure that youre in before dark
but if you need some affection mate
make sure the bitch aint a section eight
cause if so thats a monkey-wrench hoe
and you wont survive in south central

now you realize its not all that its cracked up to be
you realize that its fucked up
it aint nothin like the shit you saw on tv
palm trees and blonde bitches 
id advise to you to pack your shit and get the fuck on;
punk motherfucker

and you need your ass straight smoked
yo i wanna say whassup to dj chilly chill
sir jinx aiyyo cube these motherfuckers dont know what time it is
so show these motherfuckers whats happenin
tell these motherfuckers dont fuck around in south central
god damnit

[ice cube]
rule number three dont get caught up
cause niggaz are doing anything thats thought up
and they got a vice
on everything from dope to stolen merchandise
we discern
cause south central la is one big yearn
waitin for a brother like you to catch a disease
and start slangin kis
to an undercover or the wrong brother
and theyll smother a out of town motherfucker
so dont take your life for granted
cause its the craziest place on the planet
in la heroes dont fly through the sky of stars
they live behind bars
so everybodys doin a little dirt
and its the youngsters puttin in the most work
so be alert and stay calm
as you enter the concrete vietnam
you say the strong survive
shit the strong even die in south central

yeah you bitches you think i forgot about your ass
you tramp-ass hoes you better watch out
and for you so called baller-ass niggaz
you know what time it is south central aint no joke
got to keep your gat at all times motherfuckers
better keep one in the chamber and nine in the clip god damnit
youll sho get got just like that
this aint no joke motherfuckers
now i wanna send a shout-out to e-dog the engineer

even king kong took his black monkey ass home
when i hit the block watch them scatter like roaches
so dont be fake cause i know what a hoe is
handle my business no playin cause im focused
you the definition of what a f**kin joke is
when they see you comin they play with your emotions
f**k with my emotions and they find you in the oceans
yeah i said oceans yeah i mean plural
my boy got a knife to turn a boy into a girl
well f**k up your world no boos to my drama
well include yo mama if you f**k with my commas
i aint tryin to scary you
i aint tryin to hear you
i aint tryin to control that nigga in the mirror
ill im tryin to is bark before i fight
before i take you down might as well be polite

[chorus]

game verse


im a gangsta rap teacher nigga you better know it

throw up ya dubs like wutang who bang
harder than that nigga barrellin thru ya hood wit two chains
swangin like hes nuts cuz he dont give a f**k

its that westside connected with that nigga who flow so wreckless
he spent a hundred thousand on his necklace i bet this
motherf**kin coast aint got shit after me
aint have shit before cube except a dub c
the mack circle is back with mad purple in fact
im bout to join the lynch mob thats me squirtin the mack[ice cube]
all hail to the west coast i am the grand wizard
the west coast warlord and the future is today

cause tomorrow - that shit never come
i worry bout today and this urban decay
i worry bout hip-hop when did it flip-flop
get whack and turn into gridlock
i dont know is it a government plot
i dont give a fuck whether you love it or not
thats all we got and if you throw it away
you dumb as oj off a for-tay
in your izod this the rap god
whatchu gon put up in your ipod
downloader whatchu gon do
when your favorite mc got to sue you
cause he got to eat aint nuttin taboo
get your ass beat by erykah badu
cause you wanna steal this good music
put me out of business now you lose it

[chorus sung with ad libs]
tomorrow dont you worry bout
tomorrow that shit never come
this is very hard to swallow
keep your hand up on that throttle
dont you worry bout tomorrow

[ice cube]
tomorrow ima handle my business
but today ima drink this liquor
cause tomorrow i might be a little quicker
but today im just the same old nigga
you know that shit is still a day away
do yo thang baby put your life on layaway
cause everybody is nostradamus

to all the lil mamas
dont do a nigga like isiah thomas
if you a bitch please be honest

while youre daydreamin bout your future
motherfucker come around the corner and shoot you
dontcha get stuck in neutral
put your shit in drive while you still alive cause

[chorus]
tomorrow dont you worry bout
tomorrow that shit never come
this is very hard to swallow
keep your hand up on that throttle

[ice cube]
tomorrow~ that shit never come
i know it sounds strange but today is never done
im up in the range when the clock strikes 1
while yall countin sheep im countin benja-mons
up on my feet at the break of the sun
president of the gangster na-tion
we dont go to war we go to the store
we rob from the rich and give to the poor
hip-hop oh what a bore
lettin college motherfuckers run the front door
fuck that lets take it back to the streets
dont let viacom dictate the heat

and if i got about a thousand of them
im a crate mc accordin to them fuck that

[chorus - repeat 2x]
tomorrow dont you worry bout

and all the crazy shit we do to one another
i aint your blood brother but im your cuz brother
lets take it back to the love and how it was brother
if not we gon pull these triggers
show the world we deserve to be called niggaz
i make a f**k-up like don imus
bow on his knees and call me yo highness
you can too you got the power to
dont let this motherf**kin system devour you
i wont pretend or act like im knowin you
but check it out i understand what you goin through

[chorus sung from samples]
but remember brothers and sisters
you can still stand tall
just be thankful
for what you got

[ice cube]
i know what yall motherf**kers thinking heh heh
here comes another rapper with a song about hope
all you wanna hear is a song about dope
and how a nigga got mo money than the pope
but hell never tell you when he drop the soap
no~ ice cube is here to drop you a note
cause some of our folk used to hang from ropes
and some of our people used to hang from trees
now the only thing hangin muhf**ker is deez
so get your mind right and ima rhyme right
f**k the limelight and a blind dyke
im the sunlight too bright to look
when its all said and done i should write the book
you too cool for school too old to know
get your ass off the grassroots and let em grow
i understand it aint no love lost
but little kids it aint no santa claus

[chorus]

[ice cube]
yeah freal
i was born in the mud but i came out clean
thats til the government tried to intervene
tried to lock me up when i was only 19
dont never ever ever let em kill your dream
i make shit raw that piss off the law
if you want some fake shit turn this off
if you want some realness i know you can feel this
maybe we can heal this just like an illness
black on black i gotcho back
people dont think that we know how to act
just because our neighborhood is filled with crack
and the cia wont take it back
never on top always on the bottom
never put your trust in hillary rodham
cause i can tell you now its gon turn out rotten
keep on pushin get em til we got em

[chorus]

[ice cube]
stand up freal
raise your hand if you sick of this bullshit
heh in the belly of the evil empire [fades][intro]

haha today was a good day
sometimes i just get on my knees you know what i mean
and pray to the man with the master plan

[verse 1]

lord have mercy my people so thirsty
come feed em either jesus or mohammad

[chorus]

i’m desperate for some corn on the cob
i’m helpless will i have to steal and rob
no black dinner so i got to ask bob
bob got a job but it’s done by a robot
no lunch breaks so it could do a whole lot
more than a human being and it’s european
ran by a korean american
so there i am surrounded by aluminum
there’s no way you can run
there’s no way you can be
it’s just and me versus modern day machinery

[chorus x2]
it’s man vs machine baby
my head’s in the guillotine baby
it might take it off clean baby
automated dreams it was man vs machine baby

[verse 2]
i’m a fly caught in the web
a fish stuck in the internet
don’t they know i’m a deathly catch
eat this meat every bite so full of stress
so what can i say to you
i’m highly relatable and biodegradable
i thought we was unfadeable
slaves to machinery is that the way to go
i don’t need you to fuck 24/7
i guess that computer love
i don’t need you to love
human contact ain’t what it used to was

[chorus x2]
it’s man vs machine baby
my head’s in the guillotine baby
it might take it off clean baby
automated dreams it was man vs machine baby

[outro x2]
the whole world is automated
it need to be investigated
when people are eliminated
what we supposed to do when its time to feed all the babies[chorus]
