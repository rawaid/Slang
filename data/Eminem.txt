you know what im saying cause they dont know shit about this 
for the 9-6 

verse 1 
ayo my pen and paper cause a chain reaction 
to get your brain relaxin cause they be actin maniac in action 
a brainiac in fact son you mainly lack attraction 
you looking zany whack with just a fraction of my tracks spun 
my rhyming skills got you climbing hills 
i travel through your mind into your spine like siren drills 
im sliming grills of roaches with sprayed on disinfectants 
twistin necks of rappers till their spinal column disconnects 
put this in decks and check the monologue turn your system up 
twist them up and indulge in the marijuana smog 
this is the season for noise pollution contamination 
examination of more cartoons than animation 
my lamination of narration 
hits a snare and bass in the track fucked up rapper interrogation 
when i declare invasion there aint no time to be staring gazing 
i turn the stage into a barren wasteland 
im infinite 

chorus 
you heard of hell well i was sent from it 
i went to it serving a sentence for murdering instruments 
now im trying to repent from it 
but when i hear the beat im tempted to make another attempt at it 
im infinite 

verse 2 
bust it i let the beat commence so i can beat the sense in your elite defense 
i got some meat to mince a crew to stomp  and then two feet to rinse 
i greet the gents and ladies i spoil all your fans 
i foil plans and leave fluids leaking like oil pans
my coiled hands around this microphone are lethal 
one thought in my cerebral is deeper then a jeep full of people 
mcs are feeble i came to cause some pandemonium 
battle a band of phony mcs and stand the lonely one 
imitator intimidator stimulator simulator of data eliminator 
theres never been a greater since the burial of jesus 
fuck around and catch all of the venereal diseases 
my thesis will smash a stereo to pieces 
my accapella releases plastic masterpieces through telekinesis 
that eases you mentally gently sentimentally instrumentally 
with entity dementedly meant to be infinite 

chorus 
you heard of hell well i was sent from it 
i went to it serving a sentence for murdering instruments 
now im trying to repent from it 
but when i hear the beat im tempted to make another attempt at it

verse 3 
man i got evidence im never dense and i been clever ever since 
my residence was hesitant to do some shit that represents the m-o 
so im assuming all responsibility 
cause theres a monster will in me that always wants to kill mcs 
mic messaler slamming like a wrestler 
here to make a mess of a lyric smuggling embezzler 
no one is speacialer my skill is intergalactical 
i get cynical act a fool then i send a crew back to school 
i never packed a tool or acted cool it wasnt practical 
id rather let a tactical tactful track tickle your fancy 
in fact i cant see or cant imagine 
a man who aint a lover of beats or a fan of scratching 
this is for my family the kid who had a cameo on my last jam 
plus the man who never had a plan b 
be all you can be cause once you make an instant hit 
im tensed a bit and tempted when i see the sins my friends commit 
im infinite

and have at least a half a million for my baby girl
it may be early to be planning this stuff
cause im still struggling hard to be the man and its tough
cause man its been rough but still i manage enough
ive been taken advantage of damaged and scuffed
my hands have been cuffed
but i dont panic and huff frantic and puff
or plan to give up the minute shit hits the fan it erupts
im anteing up double or nothing ive been trouble enough
and im sick of struggling and suffering see
my destinys to rest at ease till im impressed and pleased
with my progress i wont settle for less than cheese
im on a quest to seize all my own label to call
way before my baby is able to crawl
im too stable to fall the pressure motivates
to know i hold the weight of boulders on my shoulder blades
i seen the golden gates to heaven on earth
where they dont pull a weapon on you when you stepping on turf q

verse 2 eminem
im going for broke gambling and playing for keeps
everyday in the streets scrambling and paying for cheap 
praying for sleep
dreaming with a watering mouth
wishing for a better life for my daughter and spouse
in this slaughtering house caught up in bouts
with the root of all evil
ive seen it turn beautiful people crude and deceitful
and make them do shit illegal
for these grants and jacksons
these transactions explain a mans actions
but in the mist of this insanity i found my christianity 
through god and theres a wish he granted me
he showed me how to cope with the stress
and hope for the best instead of mope and depressed
always groping a mess of flying over the nest
to selling dope with the rest
i quit smoking cess to open my chest
life is stressful inside this cesspool 
trying to wrestle i almost bust a blood vessel
my little brothers trying to learn his mathematics
hes asthmatic running home from school away from crack addicts
kids attract static children with automatics
taking target practice on teens for starter jackets
im using smarter tactics to overcome this slum
i wont become as dumb as some and succumb to scum
its cumbersome im trying to do well on this earth
but its been hell on this earth since i fell on this earth

eye-kyu

to find babbling max gaffling tracks
i grapple an axe for them baffling acts
the mysterious stab in the backs who dabble in wax
still in my yard when i sculpted the culprit
the tall shit that will end up with his skull split
then i buried the hatchet i carried the fat chick

ayo spiders are like tarantulas vandealous
living as scandalous as a television evangelist
but i can handle this im the rhyme biter crime fighter
caped crusader taking care of undeserving lime lighters
i think a living never meant for me
experimentally i found a way to spread interamentally
when i stumbled upon this resolution
by using a special fusion of chemical solution for this resolution
you couldnt see me with binoculars
i armed like an octopus
step on stage and you get socked and pushed
talking that junk like you went black guarded your back
come battle me and you get smacked as hard as you act
when i rap i represent it and will never referee in it
every minute so when i win it you never resent it
im forever demented come up with funk ill never be scented
you got the point when i cleverly said it

eminem is heading skyward
for those who thought that i would make you bored
and treat you like a piece
of plywood
ive got miracle lyrical capability all in me
with the agility to escape a killer bee colony
so get your cameras and capture how miraculous
i rap for all you draculas and showed you all how whack you was
i meant it as a dis cause you dont posses the pizzazz as this
im hazardous enough already as it is
without you adding fuel to the fire
im cruel to the liar
who fails to recognize my reign of hell rule to the sire
clinical studies show that im cynical
theres no one whos identical to my fresh and authentic flow
im sure the party people can agree
that im enchanting with the romantic
freaking the vocals so frantically
so throw your hands up in the atmosphere
and let them know the only party that was phat was here just be like

looking provocative shell let you knock it if
you press the issue and get undressed to kiss you
if you match the price otherwise she wont look at you twice
but when you catch the lice or get the urgency
to go to the emergency cause it burns to pee
dont bring your germs to me cause i aint trying to hear it
while your fighting you fucking disease trying to clear it  maxine

verse 2 denaun porter
sometimes i wonder whats your purpose in life that is
to get with every brother and unveil one of his kids shit

you say its gonna stop but it  just slows down
and then speeds back to a regular pace there is no end to this
mystery whatever your reason even is to be
you say you wanna be with me but how can you say that
when you got niggas hiding in your closet
i refrain from getting angry but you keep on that strangely

ill have you taken back to christ when youre sacrificed

for blowing up the stage with illegal contraband
i stomped your man so unless you want what he got
you best just set the mic down im steaming like a teapot
ill make the tea hot people get in my face and ask
if i wanna battle then i chase them in a jason mask
its an amazing task to battle with success
i never gave a fuck now i give a fuck less
and in a slug fest i get physical like physicians
invisible like magicians with mystical mic traditions
wicked wizardry like a sorcerer no remorse for you
when i torture you throughout the course of my orchestra
so feel the force of my spiritual images
slicing up an enemys appendages till he hemorrhages
my skin itches every time a rapper recites
and when hes through with his verse im all covered in flea bites
you wanna see fights i got a match for you
you couldnt flip shit playing in toilets with a spatula

you wanna feel the full effect of me hand a tech to me
intellectually superior ill make the whack wearier
inferior deteriorate like bacteria
materially killing serially clearly youll see
how much in fear when you hear me youll be and
shiver and shake quiver and quake
bite a rhyme and feel your jaw get stiffer and ache wither and break
you slithering snake gibbering fake fibbering flake
ill twist you into a different shape
and toss you in michigan lake for fishermens sake
if this is a dream youd wish you can wake
every diss you can take personal
we aint friends trying to make amends
if you aint ever stole a gate you can take a fence take offense
i make intense masterpieces and smash to pieces
your last releases you pass diseases thats the reason
im showing you the proper way to operate a mic
so pass it like a hot potato
ive never been less than clever and fresh
severing flesh of fools who never impressed ever infest

verse 1 eminem
im reminiscing on your tenderness and the snuggling and teasing
missing what i remember kissing and hugging and squeezing
bugging and weezing im having trouble when breathing
its even tougher when sleeping
but theres a couple of reasons that im suffering and grieving
for loving and leaving youre all im thinking of in the evening
you got my knees buckling and weakening
thoughts of nothing but freaking that im struggling to keep in
and interrupt when im speaking
i got some game that im preparing to run
the way your lips sparkle and they glare in the sun
you got your hair in a bun no matter what youre wearing you stun
cause your comparing to none i wanna share in the fun
i feel a passionate lust when im imagining just us alone at last with a
touch
i see you grasping to trust but my intentions are good
the seed is passing in dust
im not asking to rush and answer me immediately
i just wanna be there for you and you to be there for me
if you agree to repeat after me i love you i love you baby
cause i just need you to see how much im eager to be
your man legally wed your loves keeping me fed
this is easily said so you can lead or be led
if you care to be down cause aint nobody like you no where to be found

verse 2 denaun porter
baby its all on you its you i call on boo
lets set a day up so you can fall on through
well take a spin in a lexus you can chill for dinner and breakfast
long enough to see how this gentleman sexes
well start it out with caviar don parigne
and then when its a fact we are warm carry on
well take it slow see nobody will hurry things
i got the herbs the bacardi and hurricane
if daiquiris are in debate and not your thing that day
its still all right cause i got minute maid and tangeray
your an incredible one thats rare in bed with edible underwear
you look impeccable nothing compares
i dream of freaking you the women that will speak it too so
it seems that there is not an end to things that we can do so
now we all set to play only thing left to say is
when you step away baby but dont forget the neglicie

attention all units attention all units
we have an all points bulletin out on a man with green hair
i repeat we have an apb on a man with green hair
hes armed with a knife i repeat hes armed with a knife
proceed with caution watch your back fellas
he could be coming at your girlfriend next

verse 1
theres a joker on the loose from the psychiatric ward
his face is up on the bulletin board with a reward
hell stab you with a sword dont be fooled by his charm
hes probably armed with intent to do bodily harm
ring the alarm look for a man with green hair
check at your girls house he was last seen there
hes has a mean stare but usually cracks jokes
good luck on your mission and guard your backs folks

chorus
i make you think youre a best friend then
why i oughtta
hit a bitch snake from the back i make you think youre a best friend then
why i oughtta
stay away from him he aint no good

verse 2
we got the walkie-talkies to keep us all informed
suited up head to toe in detective uniforms
our unit storms in we split the ghetto in sectors
locking down every block and put up metal detectors
protectors and be sure that you stand close
watch each others backs and guard your command post
and most of all be advised that hes wise
he could be disguised as one of your very own guys

chorus
i make you think youre a best friend then
why i oughtta
hit a bitch snake from the back i make you think youre a best friend then
why i oughtta
stay away from him he aint no good

verse 3
im on a solo mission to find him personally
to settle the score and beat then him mercifully
for what he first did to me
its sure to be the last
following footprints with a magnifying glass
to drag his lying ass back to his padded cell
im mad as hell on the trail of the tattle tail
i heard a yell the voice sounded familiar
give me your girlfriend or im gonna kill ya

chorus
i make you think youre a best friend then
why i oughtta
hit a bitch snake from the back i make you think youre a best friend then
why i oughtta
stay away from him he aint no good

verse 4
i followed the voice that led down a flight of steps
sneezing at dust and swinging at the spider-webs
inside the depths of his basement
i taste lint in my mouth then the lights in the place went
i saw my life flash in front of my eyes
i felt a butcher knife slash at one of my thighs
none of my guys knew where im at i was doomed
then i remembered the flashlight in my costume

chorus
i make you think youre a best friend then
why i oughtta
hit a bitch snake from the back i make you think youre a best friend then
why i oughtta
stay away from him he aint no good

verse 5
dealing with backstabbers there was one thing i learned
theyre only powerful when you got your back turned
i yearned for the day that we finally met again
so i can give him a taste of his own medicine
he shed his skin then he promised to come clean
i took his butcher knife and jabbed it into his spleen
cut him at the seam then dragged the fella home
beating him over the head with the telephone

police voice
attention all cars attention all cars
unit 313 has apprehended the suspect
hes going back to the crazy home i repeat
hes going back to the crazy home how about that

chorus
i make you think youre a best friend then
why i oughtta
hit a bitch snake from the back i make you think youre a best friend then
why i oughtta
stay away from him he aint no good
i make you think youre a best friend then
why i oughtta
hit a bitch snake from the back i make you think youre a best friend then
why i oughtta
stay away from him he aint no good
i make you think youre a best friend then
why i oughtta
hit a bitch snake from the back i make you think youre a best friend then
why i oughtta
stay away from him he aint no goodmen singing

girls voice talking over the singing
jealous  what he mean jealous know what im saying

he dont buy me no clothes nigga aint got no money no vibe no dick
i mean what do i got to be jealous for
he aint gonna make it no where he aint got no type of time
he has no career move i mean

verse 1
i come home every single day from working double shifts
and stop along the way to pick you up a couple gifts
i come inside and you pretend you miss me when you kiss me
then you diss me and we strenuously fight continuously
again you frisk me for numbers trying to bust me
it must be only just because you never learned to trust me
plus we only squabble only irrelevant issues
too many tissues for my feelings you misuse
i buy you jewelry you make a fool of me
i bring you diamond rings you say im bad at timing things
so whats a man to do when all i hand to you is handed back to me
you act to be this gangsta bitch that aint what first attracted me
i used to love your company now you always bugging me
for information and you tell your friends you plan on dumping me
so ima wait for your evacuation
cause every accusation makes me wanna smack your face in
see ive never been so sure and your just insecure
so my solution to your jealousy presents a cure
i recommend you take your things and check them in
look at the nervous wreck im in i need my second wind say what

chorus men singing

verse 2
i used to be a puppet and a sucker for your silent treatments
i used to be intoxicated with your sweet sense
until the day i started following your feetprints
and tapping in your phone conversations through the heat vents
it made complete sense theres someone else you like
so i confronted you and asked you who was mike
and you was like  **i need a new nigga** sampled
someone rich that i could follow
and youll be over me by the time you see tomorrow
leaving me in sorrow brandy never felt so broken hearted
i fell apart when you departed then the joking started
i was an open target you play comedian
and i became the laughing stock but now im on my feet again
and so we meet again your acting like an ex-wife
all in my sex life i got a message from phife
he goes you didnt want me to see you then i dont want you now
take a towel wipe your brow quit trying to hunt me down
you run me down and now your trying to apologize
for all the lies and every time you made me ball my eyes
because i got a bigger wallet size you wanna swing it
jealousy is in the house yall fellas sing it

inebriated till my stress is eleviated

illiterate illigitimate shit spitter

and if you hear a man that sounds like me smackem
and ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from
repeat

i lace tunes im out this world like space moons
with a bunch crazed loons dismissin brains like braze wounds
nothing but idiots and misfits dipshits
doing whippits passed out like sanford snippits
wheres the weed i wanna tamper with it
ima let your grandpa hit it
mix it up with cocaine so her cant forget it
fuck it maybe im a bum
but i was put on this earth to make your baby mama cum
so what im on is way beyond the bomb or any alcoholic beverage
losing all of my leverage
went up inside the first national bank broke and left rich
walking bio-hazard causing wreckage
smoked out like 
band just making my neck itch
what the fuck gimme the tech bitch
you just lost your tip theres a pubic hair in my breakfast
got shit popping off like bottle cap tips
get your cap peeled like the dead skin of your mamas chapped lips
slap hips support domestic violence
beat your bitches ass while your kids stare in silence
im just joking is dirty dozens really dust smoking
if all your shits missing than probably one of us broke in

chorus

my heads ringing like it was spider sense tingling
lit it like green bay did when they shitted on new england
im out the game put the second string in
this brandy got my swinging
bobbing back and forth like a penguin
delinquent toking microphones with broken english
make your mama be like ohh this is good who sing this
slim shady his tape is dope i love it
its rugged but he needs to quit talking all that drug shit
it was predicted by a medic
id grow to be an addicted diabetic
living off liquid triametic
pathetic but i dont think this headaches ever vanishing
panicing i think i might have just took too much anasin
frozen manaquin posted stiffer than a statue
i think im dying god is that you
somebody help me before i od on an lp
take me to er asap for and iv
motherfuck jop they dont support no hip hop
they say thats where it ends the closest they gon come is tupac
its politics its all a fix
setup by these white blue collared hicks
just to make a dollar off of black music
with a subliminal ball of tricks
but those can kiss ass and swallow dicks

choruslife by marshall mathers
what is life
life is like a big obstacle
in front of your optical to slow you down
and every time you think you gotten past it
its gonna come back around and tackle you to the damn ground

what are friends
friends are people that you think are your friends
but they really your enemies with secret identities
and disguises to hide they true colors
so just when you think you close enough to be brothers
they wanna come back and cut your throat when you aint lookin

what is money
money is what makes a man act funny
money is the root of all evil
moneyll make them same friends come back around
swearing that they was always down

what is life
im tired of life

im tired of backstabbing ass snakes with friendly grins
im tired of committing so many sins
tired of always giving in when this bottle of henny wins
tired of never having any ends

tired of having skinny friends hooked on crack and mini-thins
im tired of this dj playing your shit when he spins
tired of not having a deal
tired of having to deal with the bullshit without grabbing the steel

tired of drowning in my sorrow
tired of having to borrow a dollar for gas to start my monte carlo
im tired of motherfuckers spraying shit and dartin off
im tired of jobs startin off at five fifty an hour then this boss wonders why im smartin off
im tired of being fired every time i fart and cough

tired of having to work as a gas station clerk
for this jerk breathing down my neck driving me berserk
im tired of using plastic silverware
tired of working in building square
tired of not being a millionaire

but if i had a million dollars
id buy a damn brewery and turn the planet into alcoholics
if i had a magic wand
id make the world suck my dick without a condom on while im on the john
if i had a million bucks
it wouldnt be enough cause id still be out robbing armored trucks
if i had one wish
i would ask for a big enough ass for the whole world to kiss

im tired of being white trash broke and always poor
tired of taking pop bottles back to the party store
tired of not having a phone
tired of not having a home to have one in if i did have it on

tired of not driving a bm
tired of not working at gm tired of wanting to be him
tired of not sleeping without a tylenol pm
tired of not performing in a packed coliseum

tired of not being on tour
tired of fucking the same blonde whore after work in the back of a contour
im tired of faking knots with a stack of ones
having a lack of funds and resorting back to guns

tired of being stared at
tired of wearing the same damn nike air hat
tired of stepping in clubs wearing the same pair of lugz
tired of people saying theyre tired of hearing me rap about drugs

tired of other rappers who aint bringin half the skill as me
saying they wasnt feeling me on nobodys as ill as me
im tired of radio stations telling fibs
tired of j-l-b saying where hip-hop lives

but if i had a million dollars
id buy a damn brewery and turn the planet into alcoholics
if i had a magic wand
id make the world suck my dick without a condom on while im on the john
if i had a million bucks
it wouldnt be enough cause id still be out robbing armored trucks
if i had one wish
i would ask for a big enough ass for the whole world to kiss

im tired of all of this bullshit
telling me to be positive
howm i posed to be positive when i dont see shit positive

furious four motherfuckers
flashin in front of your face without the grand masters

left the keys in the van with a gat in each hand
went up in eastland and shot a policeman
fuck a peace plan if a citizen bystands
this shit is in my hands heres your life span
and for what your lifes worth this money is twice that
grab a couple grand and lay-up in iceland
see im a nice man but money turned me to satan
im thirsty for this green so bad im dehydratin
hurry up with the cash bitch i got a ride waitin
shot a man twice in the back when he tried skatin
i want the whole pie i wont be denied nathan
maybe i need my head inside straightened
brain contemplatin clean out the register
dip before somebody catches ya
or gets your description an sketches ya
then connects you as the prime suspect
but i aint set to flee the scene of the crime just yet
cause i got a daughter to feed
and $200 aint enough to water the seed
the best thing would be for me to leave taco bell an hit up chess king
and have the lady at the desk bring
money from the safe in the back stepped in wavin the mac
cooperate and we can operate and save an attack
this bitch tried to escape in the jack
grabbed her by the throat its murder she wrote
you barely heard a word as she choked
it wasnt nuttin for her to be smoked
then i slammed her on her back til her vertebrae broke
just then the pigs bust in yellin freeze
but im already wanted for sellin kis
and a bunch of other felonies from a to z like spellin bees
so before i dropped to the ground and fell on knees
i bust shots they bust back
hit me square in the chest i wasnt wearin a vest

left the house pullin out the drive backin out
 backin out this ladys jag started blackin out
pulled the mac-10 out and stuck it in her face
shut ya yackin mouth before i blow the brain from out the back ya scalp
drug her by her hair smacked her up
thinkin fuck it mug her while youre there jacked her up
stole her car made a profit
grabbed a tape from out the deck and offed it out the window
like the girl on set it off did
jetted off kid stole the whip now im a criminal
drove it through somebodys yard dove into they swimmin pool
climbed out and collapsed on the patio
i made it out alive but im injured badly though
parents screamin johnny go in and call the police
tell em theres a crazy man disturbing all of the peace
tried to stall him at least long enough to let me leap up
run in they crib and at least leave with some little cheap stuff
actin like they never seen nobody hit a  before
smashed the window grabbed the nintendo 64
when they sell out in stores the price triples
i ran up the block jumpin kids on tricycles
and collided with an 80-year old lady with groceries
there goes the cheese eggs milk and post toasties
stood up and started to see stars
too many siren sounds it seemed like a thousand police cars
barely escaped must o been some dumb-luck
jumped up and climbed the back of a movin dump truck
but i think somebody seen me maybe
plus i lost the damn nintendo and i must o dropped the beanie baby
fuck it i give up im surrounded in blue suits
came out with a white flag hollerin truce truce dont shoot
surrendered my weapon to cops
wasnt me it was the gangsta rap and the peppermint schnopps

chorus 
all i see is murder murder my mind state

all i see is murder murder my mind state
murder murder murder and kill kill kill 

all i see is murder murder my mind state
makes it too late for cops in tryin to stop the crime rate

scratches to fade outlife by marshall mathers
what is life
life is like a big obstacle
put in front of your optical to slow you down
and everytime you think you gotten past it
its gonna come back around and tackle you to the damn ground
what are friends
friends are people that you think are your friends
but they really your enemies with secret indentities
and disguises to hide they true colors
so just when you think you close enough to be brothers
they wanna come back and cut your throat when you aint lookin
what is money
money is what makes a man act funny
money is the root of all evil
moneyll make them same friends come back around
swearing that they was always down
what is life
im tired of life
im tired of backstabbing ass snakes with friendly grins
im tired of committing so many sins
tired of always giving in when this bottle of henny wins
tired of never having any ends
tired of having skinny friends hooked on crack and mini-thins
im tired of this dj playing your shit when he spins
tired of not having a deal
tired of having to deal with the bullshit without grabbing the steel
tired of drowning in my sorrow
tired of having to borrow a dollar for gas to start my monte carlo
im tired of motherfuckers spraying shit and dartin off
im tired of jobs startin off at five fifty an hour
then this boss wanders why im smartin off
im tired of being fired everytime i fart and cough
tired of having to work as a gas station clerk
for this jerk breathing down my neck driving me bezerk
im tired of using plastic silverware
tired of working in building square
tired of not being a millionaire

but if i had a million dollars
id buy a damn brewery and turn the planet into alcoholics
if i had a magic wand id make the world suck my dick
without a condom on while im on the john
if i had a million bucks
it wouldnt be enough because id still be out
robbing armored trucks
if i had one wish
i would ask for a big enough ass for the whole world to kiss

im tired of being white trash broke and always poor
tired of taking pop bottles back to the party store
im tired of not having a phone
tired of not having a home to have one in if i did have it on
tired of not driving a bm
tired of not working at gm tired of wanting to be him
tired of not sleeping without a tylenol pm
tired of not performing in a packed coliseum
tired of not being on tour
tired of fucking the same blonde whore after work
in the back of a contour
im tired of faking knots with a stack of ones
having a lack of funds and resorting back to guns
tired of being stared at
im tired of wearing the same damn nike air hat
tired of stepping in clubs wearing the same pair of lugz
tired of people saying theyre tired of hearing me rap about drugs
tired of other rappers who aint bringin half the skill as me
saying they wasnt feeling me on nobodys as ill as me
im tired of radio stations telling fibs
tired of j-l-b saying where hip-hop lives

but if i had a million dollars
id buy a damn brewery and turn the planet into alcoholics
if i had a magic wand id make the world suck my dick
without a condom on while im on the john
if i had a million bucks
it wouldnt be enough because id still be out
robbing armored trucks
if i had one wish
i would ask for a big enough ass for the whole world to kiss

way before my baby daughter hailey
i was harassed daily by this fat kid named dangelo bailey
an eighth grader who acted obnoxious cause his father boxes
so everyday hed shove me in the lockers

one day he came in the bathroom while i was pissin
and had me in the position to beat me into submission
he banged my head against the urinal till he broke my nose
soaked my clothes in blood grabbed me and choked my throat

i tried to plead and tell him we shouldnt beef
but he just wouldnt leave he kept chokin me and i couldnt breathe
he looked at me and said you gonna die honkey
the principal walked in whats going on in here
and started helpin him stomp me

i made them think they beat me to death
holdin my breath for like five minutes before they finally left
then i got up and ran to the janitors storage booth
kicked the door hinge loose and ripped out the four inch screws
grabbed some sharp objects brooms and foreign tools
this is for every time you took my orange juice

or stole my seat in the lunchroom and drank my chocolate milk
every time you tipped my tray and it dropped and spilt
im gettin you back bully now once and for good
i cocked the broomstick back and swung hard as i could
and beat him over the head with it till i broke the wood
knocked him down stood on his chest with one foot

made it home later that same day
started reading a comic and suddenly everything became gray
i couldnt even see what i was tryin to read
i went deaf and my left ear started to bleed

my mother started screamin what are you on drugs
look at you youre gettin blood all over my rug sorry
she beat me over the head with the remote control
opened a hole and my whole brain fell out of my skull

i picked it up and screamed look bitch what have you done
m oh my god im sorry son
e shut up you cunt
i said fuck it took it and stuck it back up in my head
then i sewed it shut and put a couple of screws in my neck

brain damage ever since the day i was born

they say i never knew which way i was goin
but everywhere i go they keep playin my song

hillary clinton tried to slap me and call me a pervert
i ripped her fucking tonsils out and fed her sherbet bitch

smoke weed take pills drop outta school kill people and drink
jump behind the wheel like it was still legal
im dumb enough to walk in a store and steal

some people only see that im white ignoring skill
cause i stand out like a green hat with an orange bill
but i dont get pissed yall dont even see through the mist
how the fuck can i be white i dont even exist
i get a clean shave bathe go to a rave
die from an overdose and dig myself up out of my grave
my middle finger wont go down how do i wave
and this is how im supposed to teach kids how to behave

now follow me and do exactly what you see
dont you wanna grow up to be just like me
i slap women and eat shrooms then od
now dont you wanna grow up to be just like me

me and marcus allen went over to see nicole
when we heard a knock on the door knock mustve been ron gold
jumped behind the door put the orgy on hold
killed em both then smeared blood on the white bronco we did it
my mind wont work
if my spine dont jerk
i slapped garth brooks out of his rhinestone shirt
im not a player just an ill rhyme-sayer
thatll spray an aerosol can up at the ozone layer *psssssssh*
my rap styles warped
im runnin out the morgue
with your dead grandmothers corpse to throw it on your porch *scream*
jumped in a chickenhawk cartoon with a cape on
and beat up foghorn leghorn
with an acorn
im about as normal as norman bates
with deformative traits
a premature birth that was four minutes late
mother are you there i love you
i never meant to hit you over the head with that shovel *evil laugh*
will someone please explain
to my brain
that i just severed a main vein
with a chainsaw and im in pain
i take a breather and sigh either im high
or im nuts cause if you aint tiltin this room neither am i
so when you see your mom with a thermometer
shoved in her ass then it probably is obvious i got it on with her
cause when i drop this solo shit its over with

dont you wanna grow up to be just like me

hey yo
this song is dedicated to all the happy people
all the happy people who have real nice lives and have no idea whats it like to be broke as fuck



i feel like im walking a tight rope without a circus net
poppin percocet im a nervous wreck
i deserve respect but i work a sweat for this worthless check
bout to burst this tech at somebody to reverse this debt

minimum wage got my adrenaline caged
full of venom and rage especially when im engaged
and my daughters down to her last diaper its got my ass hyper
i pray that god answers maybe ill ask nicer

watchin ballers while they flossin in their pathfinders
these overnight stars becoming autograph signers
we all long to blow up and leave the past behind us
along with the small-frys and average half-pinters

but player haters turnin bitch like they have vaginas
cause we see them dollar signs and let the cash blind us
money will brainwash you and leave your ass mindless
snakes slither in the grass spineless

thats rock bottom when this life makes you mad enough to kill
thats rock bottom when you want something bad enough to steal
thats rock bottom when you feel like youve had it up to here
cause you mad enough to scream but you sad enough to tear

thats rock bottom when this life makes you mad enough to kill
thats rock bottom when you want something bad enough to steal
thats rock bottom when you feel like youve had it up to here
cause you mad enough to scream but you sad enough to tear

my life is full of empty promises and broken dreams
im hoping things look up but there aint no job openings
i feel discouraged hungry and malnourished
livin in this house with no furnace unfurnished

and im sick of working dead end jobs with lame pay
and im tired of being hired and fired the same day
but fuck it if you know the rules to the game play
cause when we die we know we all going the same way

cause its cool to be the player but it sucks to be the fan
when all you need is bucks to be the man
plus a luxury sedan comfortable and roomy in a six
but they threw me in the mix with all these gloomy lunatics

who walk around depressed and smoke a pound of cess a day
and yesterday went by so quick it seems like it was just today
my daughter wants to throw the ball but im too stressed to play
live half my life and throw the rest away

thats rock bottom when this life makes you mad enough to kill
thats rock bottom when you want something bad enough to steal
thats rock bottom when you feel like youve had it up to here
cause you mad enough to scream but you sad enough to tear

thats rock bottom when this life makes you mad enough to kill
thats rock bottom when you want something bad enough to steal
thats rock bottom when you feel like youve had it up to here
cause you mad enough to scream but you sad enough to tear

theres people that love me and people that hate me
but its the evil that made me this backstabbing deceitful and shady
i want the money the women the fortune and fame
if it means i end up burning in hell scorching in flames

if it means im stealing your checkbook and forging your name
this lifetime bliss for eternal torture and pain
cause right now i feel like just hit the rock bottom
i got problems now everybody on my blocks got em

im screaming like them two cops when 2pac shot em
holding two glocks i hope your doors got new locks on em
my daughters feet aint got no shoes or socks on em
and them rings you wearin look like they got a few rocks on em

and while you flaunt em i could be takin em to shops to pawn em
i got a couple of rings and a brand new watch you want em
cause i never went gold off one song
im running up on someones lawn with guns drawn

thats rock bottom when this life makes you mad enough to kill
thats rock bottom when you want something bad enough to steal
thats rock bottom when you feel like youve had it up to here
cause you mad enough to scream but you sad enough to tear

thats rock bottom when this life makes you mad enough to kill
thats rock bottom when you want something bad enough to steal
thats rock bottom when you feel like youve had it up to here
cause you mad enough to scream but you sad enough to tear

thats rock bottomwhoa
a get your hands in the air and get to clappin em

flavor with no seasonin this is the sneak preview
ill diss your magazine and still wont get a weak review
ill make your freak leave you smell the folgers crystals
this is a lyrical combat gentlemen hold your pistols

but i form like voltron and blast you with my shoulder missiles
slim shady m&amp;m was the old initials bye-bye
extortion snortin supportin abortion
pathological liar blowin shit outta proportion

the looniest zaniest spontaneous sporadic
impulsive thinker compulsive drinker addict
half animal half man
dumpin your dead body inside of a fuckin trash can
with more holes than an afghan

so when you see me on your block with two glocks

sick of naggin bosses bitchin while im washin dishes

roger
neveri dont know why this world keeps turning
round and round
but i wish it would stop and let me off right now

yes man
as the world turns
we all experience things in life
trials and tribulations
that we all must go through
when someone wants to test us
when someone tries our patience

i hang with a bunch of hippies and wacky tobacco planters
who swallow lit roaches and light up like jack-o-lanterns
outsiders baby and we suing the courts
cuz were dope as fuck and only get a 2 in the source

they never shouldve booted me out of reform school
deformed fool takin a shit in a warm pool
so they threw me out the ramada inn
i said it wasnt me i got a twin oh my god its you not again

it all started when my mother took my bike away
cause i murdered my guinea pig and stuck him in the microwave
after that it was straight to the 40 ouncers
slappin teachers and jackin off in front of my counselors

class clown freshman dressed like les nessman
fuck the next lesson ill past the test guessin
and all the other kids said eminems a dishead
hell never last the only class hell pass is phys ed

maybe true till i told this bitch in gym class
that she was too fat to swim laps she needed slim fast who me
yeah bitch you so big you walked into big tannys and stepped on jenny craig

she picked me up to snap me like a skinny twig
put me in the headlock then i thought of my guinea pig
i felt the evilness and started transformin rarrrr
it began storming i heard a bunch of cheering fans swarming

grabbed that bitch by her hair drug her across the ground
and took her up to the highest diving board and tossed her down
sorry coach its too late to tell me stop
while i drop this bitch face down and watch her belly flop

as the world turns
these are the days of our lives
these are the things that we must go through
day by day

we drive around in million dollar sports cars
while little kids hide this tape from their parents like bad report cards
outsiders and we suing the courts
cuz we dope as fuck and only get a 2 in the source

hypercondriac hanging out at the laundry-mat
where all the raunchy fat white trashy blondes be at
dressed like a sailor standin by a pale of garbage

id like to treat ya to a faygo and a slice of pizza
but im broke as fuck and i dont get paid till the first of next month

but i aint got no weed no phillies or no papers
plus im a rapist and a repeated prison escapist
so gimme all your money and dont try nothin funny
cause you know your stinkin ass is too fat to try to out run me

i went to grab my gun
thats when her ass put it on me
wit an uppercut and hit me with a basket of laundry
i fell through the glass doors started causin a scene
then slid across the floor and flew right into a washin machine

jumped up with a broken back
thank god i was smokin crack all day and doped up off coke and smack
all i wanted to do was rape the bitch and snatch her purse
now i wanna kill her but so i gotta catch her first

ran through alleys parkin lots and took a shortcut
saw the house she ran up in and shot her fuckin porch up
kicked the door down to murder this divorced slut
looked around the room thats when i seen the bedroom door shut

i know youre in there bitch i got my gun cocked
you might as well come out now
she said come in its unlocked
i walked in and all i smelled was liz claiborne
and seen her spread across the bed naked watchin gay porn

she said come here big boy lets get acquainted
i turned around to run twisted my ankle and sprained it
she came at me at full speed nothin could stop her
i shot her five times and every bullet bounced off her

i started to beg no please let go
but she swallowed my fuckin leg whole like an egg roll
with one leg left now im hoppin around crippled
i grabbed my pocket knife and sliced off her right nipple

just trying to buy me some time then i remembered this magic trick
den den den den den den go go gadget dick

i reckon you aint familiar with these here parts
you know theres a story behind that there saloon
twenty years ago two outlaws took this whole town over
sheriffs couldnt stop em
quickest damn gun slingers ive ever seen
got murdered in cold blood
that ol saloon there was their lil home away from home
they say the ghosts of bad and evil still live in that tavern
and on a quiet night
you can still hear the footsteps of slim shady and royce da five-nine

eminem
i dont speak i float in the air wrapped in a sheet
im not a real person im a ghost trapped in a beat
i translate when my voice is read through a sismograph
and a noise is bred picked up and transmitted through royces head aahhh

trapped him in his room possessed him and hoist his bed
till the evilness flows through his blood like poisonous lead
told him each one of his boys is dead
i asked him to come to the dark side he made a choice and said

royce
who hard yo i done heard worse
we can get in two cars and accelerate at each other
to see which onell swerve first
two blind bandits panic whose mental capacity holds
that of a globe on top of nine other planets

kissed the cheek of the devil
intelligence level is hell-ier than treble peakin on speakers in the ghetto
dismissal im not a fair man disgraced the race of a atheist
intercepting missles wit my bare hands like a patriot

one track sliced without swords i buried the christ corpse
in my past life when the black knight mounted the white horse
and stay over-worked its like the nazis in the nations collaborating
attemptin to take over the earth

eminem
cuz this is what happens when bad meets evil
we hit the trees till we look like vietnamese people
hes evil and im bad like steve segal
above the law cuz i dont agree wit police either shit me neither

we aint eager to be legal
so please leave me wit the keys to your jeep eagle
i breathe ether in three lethal amounts
while i stab myself in the knee with a diseased needle

releasin rage on anybody in squeezing range
cold enough to make the seasons change into freezing rain
hes insane no im not i just want to shoot up and im pissed off
cuz i cant find a decent vain

royce
the disaster wit dreds
im bad enough to commit suicide and survive long enough
to kill my soul after im dead
when in danger its funny actually my flavors similar to a waiter
cuz i serve any stranger wit money

i spray a hundred man until they joint chains
while slippin bullets at point blank range like they was punches
piss on a flag and burn it murder you then come to your funeral
serve this lobbyist strangle your body then confirm you

whippin human ass throwin blows crackin jaws
wit my fists wrapped in gause dipped in glue and glass
im blazin mcs at the same time amazin mcs
somehow mcs aint that eye-brow raisin to me
from all of angles of us flash a mack loud enough to cast a avalanche

and expect them not to know what a womans clitoris is

of course theyre gonna know what intercourse is
by the time they hit 4th grade they got the discovery channel dont they
we aint nothing but mammals well some of us are cannibals
who cut other people open like cantaloupes

but if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
then theres no reason that a man and another man cant elope eww
but if you feel like i feel i got the antidote
women wave your pantyhose sing the chorus and it goes

and my prediction is that you gon probably fall
either somewhere in the lobby or the hallway wall
and everythings spinnin your beginning to 
think women are swimmin in pink linen again in the sink
then in a couple of minutes that bottle of guinness is finished
you are now allowed to officially slap bitches

you have the right to remain violent and start wilin
start a fight with the same guy that was smart eyen ya
get in the car and start it and start drivin
over the island and cause a 42 car pile up
earth calling pilot to co-pilot looking for life on this 
planet sir no sign of it

eminem impersonating mr mackey &amp; eric cartman 
okay children quiet down quiet down
children id like to introduce our new substitute teacher for the day
his name is mr shady
children quiet down please
brian dont throw that shut up
mr shady will be your new substitute while mr kaniff is out with pneumonia hes got aids
good luck mr shady



hi there little boys and girls fuck you
today were going to learn how to poison squirrels

but first id like you to meet my friend bob huh
say hi bob hi bob bobs 30 and still lives with his mom
he dont got a job cause bob sits at home and smokes pot
but his 12 year old brother looks up to him an awful lot

and bob likes to hang out at the local waffle spot
and wait in the parking lot for waitresses off the clock
when its late and the lot gets dark and fake like he walks his dog
drag em in the woods and goes straight to the chopping block

and even if they escaped and they got the cops
the ladies would all be just so afraid theyd drop the charge
till one night mrs stacy went off the job
when she felt someone grab hold of her face and said not to talk

but stacy knew it was bob and said knock it off
but bob wouldnt knock it off cause hes crazy and off his rocker
crazy good as slim shady is off the block uh
you couldnt even take him to dres to give bob a doctor

grabbed stacy by the legs and chopped them off her
and dropped her off in the lake for the cops to find her
but ever since the day stacy went off to wander they never found her
and bob still hangs at the waffle diner

and thats the story of bob and his marijuana and what it might do to you
so see if the squirrels want it its bad for you

mr mackey impersonation eminem
see children drugs are bad come on
and if you dont believe me ask your dad raise your hand
and if you dont believe him ask your mom thats right
shell tell you how she does him all the time she will
 
so kids say no to drugs thats right
so you dont act like everyone else does uh huh
and theres really nothing else to say sing along
drugs are just bad mkay



my penis is the size of a peanut have you seen it
fuck no you aint seen it its the size of a peanut huh
speaking of peanuts you know what else is bad for squirrels
ecstasy its the worst drug in the world

if someone ever offers it to you dont do it
kids two hitsll probably drain all your spinal fluid
and spinal fluid is final you wont get it back
so dont get attached itll attack every bone in your back

meet zach 21 years old
after hanging out with some friends at a frat party he gets bold
and decides to try five when hes bribed by five guys
and peer pressure will win every time you try to fight it

suddenly he starts to convulse and his pulse
goes into hyperdrive and his eyes roll back in his skull
his back arches up looks like the mcdonalds arches
hes on donalds carpet layin horizontal barfin

and everyone in the apartment starts laughin at him 
hey adam zach is a jackass look at him 
cause they took it too so they think its funny 
so theyre laughing at basically nothing except maybe wasting their money

meanwhile zachs in a coma the action is over
and his back and his shoulders hunched up like hes practicing yoga 
and thats the story of zach the ecstasy maniac
so dont even feed that to squirrels class cause its bad for you 

mr mackey impersonation eminem
see children drugs are bad thats right
and if you dont believe me ask your dad thats right
and if you dont believe him ask your mom you can
shell tell you how she does him all the time she will
 
so kids say no to drugs smoke crack
so you dont act like everyone else does thats right
and theres really nothing else to say uh huh
drugs are just bad mkay



and last but not least one of the most humongous
problems among young people today is fungus
it grows from cow manure they pick it out wipe if off bag it up
and you put it right in your mouth and chew it yum yum

and then you start to see some dumb stuff
and everything slows down when you eat some of em
and sometimes you see things that arent there like what
like fat women in g-strings with orange hair

mr shady whats a g-string its yarn clair
women stick them up their behinds go out and wear em
and if you swallow too much of the magic mushrooms
whoops did i say magic mushrooms i meant fungus

your tongue gets all swole up like a cows tongue how come
cause it comes from a cows dung
see drugs are bad its a common fact
but your mom and dad know thats all that im good at

but dont be me cause if you grow up and go and od
theyre gonna come for me and ima have to grow a goatee
and get a disguise and hide cause itll be my fault
so dont drugs and do exactly as i dont because im bad for you

mr mackey impersonation eminem
see children drugs are bad uh huh
and if you dont believe me ask your dad put that down
and if you dont believe him ask your mom you can ask
shell tell you how she does him all the time and she will
 
so kids say no to drugs say no
so you dont act like everyone else does like i do
and theres really nothing else to say thats right
drugs are just bad mkay

eminem impersonating mr mackey &amp; eric cartman

causing terror to christina aguilera
when i grab her by the hair and drag her across the sahara

with a hair up his ass like a rabbit crawled up his pants
got a habit of holding tylenol in his hands
till it melts in his fucking palms and dissolves in his glands
so who is it
fool who visits the playground
with two biscuits to lay down the school district
get pissed with a whip with a marseburg
with a pistol grip and fed pit bull shit
sniff glue sticks like i give two shits
if i get too rich i just get sued

redman-

pop the trunk and pull out the shotgun pump
knock wood its all good
thank god for vodka
but with my luck ill probably get shot by a stalker
probably got a fanatic waiting upstairs in the attic
with an automatic calling me up there
my man stan with a gat in his hand
staking my house out in a damn tinted sedan
pull your mouth out till you cant finish a damn
ham sandwich or your canned spinach or spam
you gotta sip through a straw
shop lift through the mall
pictures of me on my moms living room wall
hey ma maybe ill give you a call

i used to be a lonely man only mad 
until i got a million dollars shit
now if i only had some fucking hair 
id pull it faster than a bullet
out of tupacs chest 
before the ambulance came too late to do it
im trying to grow it back again 
it was an accident
i had my back against a fan 
who chopped it off in amsterdam
i hate the straight jacket it aint latching
they cant lock it
so they stapled my hand 
to my pants pockets
the cells padded and battered
like someone else had it before me
and just kept throwing them-fucking-selves at it
my head is aching 
im dedicated to medication
but this med is taking to long to bring me this sedation come on
anyway i got down with dre what up
the first man who taught me how the glock sounded to spray
running up and down the street screaming fuck the police
when you still had your mothers fucking nipple 
stuck in your teeth fucking baby 
became a role model after colorado
now all they do is follow me around and holler bravo
hell yeah i punch my bitch and beat my kids in public
suck my dick bitch
im sick enough to fuck a man in his face but i wont
cause youll probably wanna stand in his place
so put a sock in it 
with your fake-ass tupac image
you faggots aint tough
you just get drunk and become talkative wanna fight  
im probably the awkwardest alcoholic talking
walking like a midget with a ladder in his back pocket
so when you see me on your block 
stumbling mumbling a bunch of dumb shit 
like my drunk uncle does
i aint buzzed im just high on life
so why on earth would i need drugs 
when i can fly on kites
motherfuckers

cause i went out and raped six girlfriends
some people just dont get it 
but i wont let it upset me
cause they dont know better
they dont know what the fuck its like to be so fed up
and fed so many uppers youre down and wont get up
my minds got a mind of its own 
sometimes i cant find it at home

shit talk about your brain being baked
my shits still in the oven on 480 degrees
hailey jade 
daddy loves you baby
dont ever tell me how to raise my daughter 
fuck you lady

left the keys in the van with a gat in each hand
went up in eastland and shot a policeman
fuck a peace plan if a citizen bystands
this shit is in my hands heres your life span
and for what your lifes worth this money is twice that
grab a couple grand and lay-up in iceland
see im a nice man but money turned me to satan
im thirsty for this green so bad im dehydratin
hurry up with the cash bitch i got a ride waitin
shot a man twice in the back when he tried skatin
i want the whole pie i wont be denied nathan
maybe i need my head inside straightened
brain contemplatin clean out the register
dip before somebody catches ya
or gets your description an sketches ya
then connects you as the prime suspect
but i aint set to flee the scene of the crime just yet
cause i got a daughter to feed
and $200 aint enough to water the seed
the best thing would be for me to leave taco bell an hit up chess king
and have the lady at the desk bring
money from the safe in the back stepped in wavin the mac
cooperate and we can operate and save an attack
this bitch tried to escape in the jack
grabbed her by the throat its murder she wrote
you barely heard a word as she choked
it wasnt nuttin for her to be smoked
then i slammed her on her back til her vertebrae broke
just then the pigs bust in yellin freeze
but im already wanted for sellin kis
and a bunch of other felonies from a to z like spellin bees
so before i dropped to the ground and fell on knees
i bust shots they bust back
hit me square in the chest i wasnt wearin a vest

jetted off kid stole the whip now im a criminal
drove it through somebodys yard dove into they swimmin pool
climbed out and collapsed on the patio
i made it out alive but im injured badly though
parents screamin johnny go in and call the police

tried to stall him at least long enough to let me leap up
run in they crib and at least leave with some little cheap stuff
actin like they never seen nobody hit a  before
smashed the window grabbed the nintendo 64
when they sell out in stores the price triples
i ran up the block jumpin kids on tricycles
and collided with an 80-year old lady with groceries
there goes the cheese eggs milk and post toasties
stood up and started to see stars
too many siren sounds it seemed like a thousand police cars
barely escaped must o been some dumb-luck
jumped up and climbed the back of a movin dump truck
but i think somebody seen me maybe
plus i lost the damn nintendo and i must o dropped the beanie baby
fuck it i give up im surrounded in blue suits
came out with a white flag hollerin truce truce dont shoot
surrendered my weapon to cops

scratches to fade outyo i keep m luv snug bruv
but im white so i dont know no thug luv
but what you do find is thugs luv then 2time
its a truecrime but most do it
like should i or shouldnt i arrr screw it
then when she finds out your cheating
she gives you a raw beating for leaving
and not luvin
then shit gets heated hotter than a hot oven
cos youve broken bonds
kissed others with open tongs
being disloyal 
like whats been planted in this soil
but this is all ive herd
how they cheat and end up dead from their bird
so if you blare a word of cheating
you havent put one foot in 
youve stook both feet in
then you start watching your back from day one
like you got your clothes the wrong way on
but as i say 
i dont know no thug luv and im not one like goldieahah

okay children quiet down quiet down
children id like to introduce our new substitute teacher for the day
his name is mr shady
children quiet down please
brian dont throw that shut up
mr shady will be your new substitute while mr kaniff is out with pneumonia hes got aids
good luck mr shady



hi there little boys and girls fuck you
today were going to learn how to poison squirrels

but first id like you to meet my friend bob huh
say hi bob hi bob bobs 30 and still lives with his mom
he dont got a job cause bob sits at home and smokes pot
but his 12 year old brother looks up to him an awful lot

and bob likes to hang out at the local waffle spot
and wait in the parking lot for waitresses off the clock
when its late and the lot gets dark and fake like he walks his dog
drag em in the woods and goes straight to the chopping block

and even if they escaped and they got the cops
the ladies would all be just so afraid theyd drop the charge
till one night mrs stacy went off the job
when she felt someone grab hold of her face and said not to talk

but stacy knew it was bob and said knock it off
but bob wouldnt knock it off cause hes crazy and off his rocker
crazy good as slim shady is off the block uh
you couldnt even take him to dres to give bob a doctor

grabbed stacy by the legs and chopped them off her
and dropped her off in the lake for the cops to find her
but ever since the day stacy went off to wander they never found her
and bob still hangs at the waffle diner

and thats the story of bob and his marijuana and what it might do to you
so see if the squirrels want it its bad for you

mr mackey impersonation eminem
see children drugs are bad come on
and if you dont believe me ask your dad raise your hand
and if you dont believe him ask your mom thats right
shell tell you how she does him all the time she will
 
so kids say no to drugs thats right
so you dont act like everyone else does uh huh
and theres really nothing else to say sing along
drugs are just bad mkay



my penis is the size of a peanut have you seen it
fuck no you aint seen it its the size of a peanut huh
speaking of peanuts you know what else is bad for squirrels
ecstasy its the worst drug in the world

if someone ever offers it to you dont do it
kids two hitsll probably drain all your spinal fluid
and spinal fluid is final you wont get it back
so dont get attached itll attack every bone in your back

meet zach 21 years old
after hanging out with some friends at a frat party he gets bold
and decides to try five when hes bribed by five guys
and peer pressure will win every time you try to fight it

suddenly he starts to convulse and his pulse
goes into hyperdrive and his eyes roll back in his skull
his back arches up looks like the mcdonalds arches
hes on donalds carpet layin horizontal barfin

and everyone in the apartment starts laughin at him 
hey adam zach is a jackass look at him 
cause they took it too so they think its funny 
so theyre laughing at basically nothing except maybe wasting their money

meanwhile zachs in a coma the action is over
and his back and his shoulders hunched up like hes practicing yoga 
and thats the story of zach the ecstasy maniac
so dont even feed that to squirrels class cause its bad for you 

mr mackey impersonation eminem
see children drugs are bad thats right
and if you dont believe me ask your dad thats right
and if you dont believe him ask your mom you can

and theres really nothing else to say uh huh
drugs are just bad mkay



and last but not least one of the most humongous
problems among young people today is fungus
it grows from cow manure they pick it out wipe if off bag it up
and you put it right in your mouth and chew it yum yum

and then you start to see some dumb stuff
and everything slows down when you eat some of em
and sometimes you see things that arent there like what
like fat women in g-strings with orange hair

mr shady whats a g-string its yarn clair
women stick them up their behinds go out and wear em
and if you swallow too much of the magic mushrooms
whoops did i say magic mushrooms i meant fungus

your tongue gets all swole up like a cows tongue how come
cause it comes from a cows dung
see drugs are bad its a common fact
but your mom and dad know thats all that im good at

but dont be me cause if you grow up and go and od
theyre gonna come for me and ima have to grow a goatee
and get a disguise and hide cause itll be my fault
so dont drugs and do exactly as i dont because im bad for you

mr mackey impersonation eminem
see children drugs are bad uh huh
and if you dont believe me ask your dad put that down
and if you dont believe him ask your mom you can ask
shell tell you how she does him all the time and she will
 
so kids say no to drugs say no
so you dont act like everyone else does like i do
and theres really nothing else to say thats right

to do some shit like that
the green and gold

i done filled my lungs up
with so much of this crack smoke
my necks bloated my techs loaded
im flat broke and im pissed off
mad at the world ive had it with girls
and im frustrated ran to the bus stop
just made it and hopped on
ready to drop bombs on the first person
who had a nice suit and a watch on
i spot john a white collar worker
in clean cut walked up to em
he was like what
whatchu mean what
you know what time it is man
at your next stop gimme that rolex watch
with that diamond wrist band
got his green and his gold dashed it
climbed in his van to steal it and seen

stole his keys put em inside the ignition and got em stuck
hopped out to flee on my feet
fucked around forgot that i left my id on the seatartist  eminem 
song  watch deez feat thirstin howl iii 
album   heavy beats vol one
submitted by  hodinem 

thirstin howl
i hit harder than four men
landing both gloves to a low blow with no cup
leave you speech-less like when arrested development broke up
carry a crow bar for egos that wont budge
crack skulls through helmets
with the penetration of a screw nailed in
return like i was sending self addressed postage
throw bricks the size of the stonehenge
before battles we pour blood and toast death to wicked infants
found on the sorceress  doorsteps
slaughter lamb and boars head
every mcs cause of boredness and mind bondage
bronchitis lung failure
language unfam-i-liar
art through a flooded air brush
road leave craft
sentences joined with words holding hands
its a tight squeeze
from where your head will be landing in exact time flight leaves

watch deez
watch deez

watch deez
dont watch that watch deez

eminem
whos arm is this
i must have cut it off at the pharmacist
who refused to renew my seventh presciption of darvecetssorry
im the old man who lives upstairs and starves his pets
and never leaves his house cause he thinks his cars possessed
i hate my life
thats why i degrade my wife
grabbed a paper plate to make a sandwichand just ate the knife
my mothers screaming please heal and take him straight to christ
meet you on the street and slap you just to break the ice
made a bomb threat with a fake device
strip you naked twice pistol whip you and force you to take advice
and if you catch me bobbin my head to some bullshit spittin
i was probably just tryin to shake the lice
bugs fallin out of my head
im wishin i was dead
while im fallin out of my bed
found it red and my rash is returning
i feel the sensation of burning
occurring usually during pain for release in my urine
screamin at my shadow please quit followin me
these pills keep screamin please quit swoalloin me
the devil keeps screaminplease get down on one knee
took the drugs before the cops ever found them on me

watch deez
watch deez

watch deez
dont watch that watch deezim the illest rapper to hold a cordless
patrolling corners
looking for hookers to punch in the mouth with a roll of quarters
im meaner in action
than rosco beating james tarteenyer
and smackin his back with vacuum cleaner attachments
i grew up in the wild hood
as a hazardous youth
with a fucked up childhood
that i used as an excuse
and aint shit changed
but kept the same mindstate
since the third time that i failed 9th grade
you probably think that im a negative person dont be so sure of it
i dont promote violence i just encourage it
i laugh at the sight of death
as i fall down a cement flight of steps
and land inside a bed of spider webs
so throw caution to the wind
you and a friend
can jump off of a bridge and if you live do it again
shit why not  blow your brain out
im blowing mine out
fuck it you only live once you might as well die now

its only fair to warn
i was born with a set of horns
and metaphors attached to my damn umbulical cord
warlord of rap little bastard with a two by four board
that smashed into your honda accord
with a 4 door ford
but a more toward  droppin an accapella
the choppa  fella
the mozarella
worse than a hellacopta propella
got you locked in the cella
with your skeleton showing
developing anorexia
while im standin next to ya
eating a full course meal watching you starve to death
with an iv in your veins
feeding you liquid darvicet
pumping you full of drugs
pull the plugs
on the gunshot victims full of bullet slugs
who were picked up in an ambulance
and driven
to receiving with the asses ripped outta they pants
and given
a less than 20 percent chance
of living
have a possible placement
its a hospital patient
storing the dead bodies in grandmas little basement
doctor kevorkian has arrived
to perform an autopsy on you while you scream im still alive
driving a rusty scalpel in through the top of your scalp
and pulling your adams apple out through your mouth
better call the fire department
ive hired a arson
to set fire to carpet
and burn up your entire apartment
im a liar to start shit 
got your bitch wrapped around my dick
so tight you need a crobar to pry her apart wit

met a retarded kid named greg with a wooden leg

driving drunk in a fire truck with the siren stuck
slammin the brakes
skiddin out cuz the tires suck
went to pull you off my dick
and got the pliers stuck

crazy enough to shoot your ass with a knife
and stab you with a gun

we rather go outta control then to be under it
yo how you goin against us
when we got nothin to loose

prayin to a god that dont excist
that wouldnt save yo bible kissin asses
even if he did
we like to twist the misted    
genetick dead end
dont got friend
skam is chatter man
posin childeren for depression
stressin any language
say my name in spansih
thats el chupacabra
suck the life outta you-ou
there wont be enough of your brain left
to fill a tea spoon
we two vanishin man that make the bad things blend
and probably go platinum on the day that the world ends

kwest
when it comes to beef
i get relieved when i kill it brief
send you a reef
get your family ready for grief
i knock your teeth
take a seat like a thief

al
them cats who ride are feminine
im singin this without
the benefit sense of cinnamon
so submit it in your mental
since you find it essential to sub the sentence
in sentence
this sentence is simple
you banned from using writing utinsels
wether cry line crayon pen or pencil
observe verse with syntax
that causes skin cracks on impact
send a rap shot before i spark back           
and then send them whack men
way back to the lab to add what most of them lack
i can hand you a manual of what i plan to do to you more tangible
you still wouldnt understand the full concept
it slips through your fingers like sandgranuals
skam will land and well hand
and a blue sea anually
and you will see which animal me
and fifty of us spittin up that written stuff
its all the same and
is the reason for cyphas prematurely spittin up
ironic phonic flow fo
sho my flow is far from enbionic
to be honest when im on the chronic antibiotic
im beyond it
the texure of my lecture is complex like a proffesors
scepticals think im exceptional when i bless sound recepticals
what runs through my vest
to be turns crews to vegetables
then grab my testicals and cup em
fuck em lets see whose fuckedthe wild gotham
the wild west {*bang bang bang*}
ha ha riiiiide

dr dre
all you see is the sun reflectin off of the gun
im ready for the showdown that go down at one
sweat on my brow lets settle it now
ima show you how real cowboys get down
im polishin gold waitin for this drama to unfold
i got a {blunt} rolled
feelin bold gangsters blood runs cold
its time to reload this old 45 colt
the winds gusty its hot muggy and dusty
bust a couple shots make sure im not rusty
its passed noon he should be here soon
sip a little moonshine inside a saloon
all of a sudden i can hear the sound of hoofs
sounds like a thousand wolves
i cock back put the toast in the holster and froze
i pose like a poster hes closer than close
i hold the heat sturdy i heard he fights dirty
but ima put thirty inside him and leave early
and just when i went to fill him with hot lead
i put the gun to his head and this is what he said

eminem
you never met me and youll probably never see me again
but i know you - the names slim - you want revenge
then dont shoot im in the same boots as you
im tellin the truth i got a price on my head too cause when you

chorus {unknown singer}

you ride like a cowboy toward the sun
and life aint fun when youre on the run
got your gold and you got your gun
but life as an outlaw just begun
got your shotgun by your side
got your horse and you got your pride
you ride til there aint no place to hide
its sad cause the bad guys always die

dr dre + eminem
he was shady i seen by the look on his face
he said take ten paces {shit} i took eight
spun around and i aimed straight for the brain
my {shit} went bang but it only fired a blank he said
you need bullets hurry up run {*imitating slick rick*}
i put a clip in the gun and pointed at his lungs
we both drew at the same time and stood stunned
go ahead shoot me but im not the one you want
i figured he was tellin the truth thats why i didnt shoot
so what we gon do its on you
do you recall when you and snoop was a group
the chronic
well all we gotta do is find a map to part two
and plus i know whos got it
who
some old dude hes got 26 plaques and he already sold two
loaded up my saddle got ready for battle
hid two pieces of gold inside of my saddle
we rolled two miles until we hit the spot
an old ghost town that everybody forgot
a place where they used to smoke chronic a lot
slim grabbed the shotgun dre heres the plot

eminem
this is the spot they call him doc loveless
hes goin around sayin he took the game from us
lets shoot him in his kneecaps hell never see it comin
but he aint got no legs they cut em off at the stomach
hes got mechanical legs he spins webs
plus hes well respected by the hip-hop heads
our mission - is to get him to stop layin eggs
and we can put him on his back down a flight of steps

dr dre
i drew two guns spun them on my fingers
kicked the swingin doors in started gun slinging
i could hear somebody singin - it sounded like a g thang
and a verse from keep their heads ringin
i said its dres day and started to spray
against 1800 he pulls a ak
hollow tips started flyin every which way

eminem
thats when i seen dre in trouble and came with the gauge
i fired the first shot spun his body around
he hit the ground and landed upside down
dre grabbed the map the plaques and the gold
i grabbed two girlies and a {blunt} thats rolled

chorus 2x

always die
the wild gotham
the wild west {*bang bang bang*}

eminem eminem eminemamerica
background the white zone is for 
 loading and unloading of passengers only no parking
we love you 
how many people are proud to be citizens
of this beautiful country of ours
the stripes and the stars for the rights that men have died for to protect
the women and men who have broke their necks for the freedom of speech 
the united states government has sworn to uphold
or so we are told
yo i want everyone to listen to the words of this song

i never would have dreamed in a million years id see
so many motherfuckin people who feel like me
who share the same views and the same exact beliefs
its like a fuckin army marchin in back of me

so many lives ive touched so much anger aimed
at no particular direction just sprays and sprays
straight through your radio waves it plays and plays
till it stays stuck in your head for days and days

who woulda thought standin in this mirror bleachin my hair
with some peroxide reachin for a t shirt to wear
that i would catapult to the forefront of rap like this
how could i predict my words would have an impact like this

i mustve struck a chord with somebody up in the office
cause congress keeps tellin me i aint causin nothin but problems
and now they sayin im in trouble wit the government im lovin it
i shoveled shit all my life and now im dumping it on

white america i could be one of your kids
white america little eric looks just like this 
white america erica loves my shit 
i go to trl look how many hugs i get 

white america i could be one of your kids
white america little eric looks just like this 
white america erica loves my shit 
i go to trl look how many hugs i get 

look at these eyes baby blue baby just like yourself
if they were brown shady lose shady sits on the shelf
but shadys cute shady knew shadys dimples would help
make ladies swoon baby ooh baby look at myself

lets do the math if i was black i woulda sold half
i aint have to graduate from lincoln high school to know that
but i can rap so fuck school im too cool to go back
gimme the mic show me where the fuckin studios at

when i was underground no one gave a fuck i was white
no labels wanted to sign me almost gave up i was like
fuck it until i met dre the only one who looked past
gave me a chance and i lit a fire up under his ass

helped him get back to the top every fan black that i got
was probably his in exchange for every white fan that hes got
like damn we just swapped sittin back lookin at shit wow
im like my skin is it startin to work to my benefit now

its white america i could be one of your kids
white america little eric looks just like this 
white america erica loves my shit 
i go to trl look how many hugs i get 

white america i could be one of your kids
white america little eric looks just like this 
white america erica loves my shit 
i go to trl look how many hugs i get 

see the problem is i speak to suburban kids
who otherwise woulda never knew these words exist
whose moms probably woulda never gave two squirts of piss
till i created so much mutherfuckin turbulence

straight out the tube right into your livin rooms i came
and kids flipped when they knew i was produced by dre
thats all it took and they were instantly hooked right in
and they connected with me too because i looked like them

thats why they put my lyrics up under this microscope
searchin with a fine tooth comb its like this rope
waitin to choke tightenin around my throat
watchin me while i write this like i dont like yes no

all i hear is lyrics lyrics constant controversy sponsors workin 
round the clock to try to stop my concerts early surely
hip hop was never a problem in harlem only in boston
after it bothered the fathers of daughters startin to blossom

so now im catchin the flack from these activists when they raggin
actin like im the first rapper to smack a bitch and say faggot
shit just look at me like im your closest pal the poster child
the mutherfuckin spokesman now

for white america i could be one of your kids
white america little eric looks just like this 
white america erica loves my shit 
i go to trl look how many hugs i get 

white america i could be one of your kids
white america little eric looks just like this 
white america erica loves my shit 
i go to trl look how many hugs i get 

so to the parents of america
i am the derringer aimed at little erica
to attack her character
the ring leader of the circus of worthless pawns
sent to lead the march right up to the steps of congress
and piss on the lawns of the white house
to burn the casket and replace it with a parental advisory sticker
to spit liquor in the faces of this democracy of hypocrisy
fuck you ms cheney
fuck you tipper gore
fuck you with the freedom of speech this divided state
of embarrassment will allow me to have
fuck you

yeah
yo yo

have you ever been hated or discriminated against
i have ive been protested and demonstrated against
picket signs for my wicked rhymes look at the times
sick as the mind of the motherfucking kid thats behind

all this commotion emotions run deep as oceans explodin
tempers flarin from parents just blow em off and keep goin
not takin nothin from no one give em hell long as im breathin
keep kickin ass in the mornin and takin names in the evenin

leavin with a taste as sour as vinegar in their mouth
see they can trigger me but theyll never figure me out
look at me now i bet ya probably sick of me now
aint you mama imma make you look so ridiculous now

im sorry mama
i never meant to hurt you
i never meant to make you cry 
but tonight im cleanin out my closet one more time

i said im sorry mama
i never meant to hurt you 
i never meant to make you cry 
but tonight im cleanin out my closet ha

i got some skeletons in my closet and i dont know if no one knows it
so before they throw me inside my coffin and close it imma expose it
ill take you back to 73
before i ever had a multi-platinum sellin cd

i was a baby maybe i was just a couple of months
my faggot father mustve had his panties up in a bunch
cause he split i wonder if he even kissed me goodbye
no i dont owe him a second thought i just fuckin wished he would die

i look at hailie and i couldnt picture leavin her side
even if i hated kim id grit my teeth and id try
to make it work with her at least for hailies sake i maybe made some mistakes
but im only human but im man enough to face em today

what i did was stupid no doubt it was dumb
but the smartest shit i did was take the bullets outta that gun
cause id have killed em shit i woulda shot kim and him both
its my life id like to welcome yall to the eminem show

im sorry mama
i never meant to hurt you
i never meant to make you cry 
but tonight im cleanin out my closet one more time

i said im sorry mama
i never meant to hurt you
i never meant to make you cry
but tonight im cleanin out my closet

now i would never diss my own mama just to get recognition
take a second to listen fore you think this record is dissin
but put yourself in my position just try to envision
witnessin your mama poppin prescription pills in the kitchen

bitchin that someones always goin through her purse and shits missin
goin through public housin systems victim of münchhausens syndrome
my whole life i was made to believe i was sick when i wasnt
till i grew up now i blew up it makes you sick to ya stomach doesnt it

wasnt it the reason you made that cd for me ma
so you could try to justify the way you treated me ma
but guess what ya gettin older now and its cold when youre lonely
and nathans growin up so quick hes going to know that youre phony

and hailies getting so big now you should see her shes beautiful
but youll never see her she wont even be at your funeral
see what hurts me the most is you wont admit you was wrong
bitch do your song keep telling yourself that you was a mom

but how dare you try to take when you didnt help me to get
you selfish bitch i hope you fucking burn in hell for this shit
remember when ronnie died and you said you wished it was me
well guess what i am dead - dead to you as can be

im sorry mama
i never meant to hurt you
i never meant to make you cry 
but tonight im cleanin out my closet one more time

i never meant to make you cry 
but tonight im cleanin out my closetpeople

im a soldier
im a soldier yo 

never was a thug just infatuated with guns
never was a gangster till i graduated to one
and got the rep of a villain for weapon concealin
took the image of a thug kept shit appealing

willin to stick out my neck for respect if it meant life or death
never lived to regret what i said
when youre me people just wanna see if its true
if its you what you say in your raps is what you do

so they feel its part of ya obligation to fulfill
when they see you on the streets face to face are you for real
the confrontation aint no conversation if you feel
youre in violation any hesitationll get you killed

if you feel it kill it if you can conceal it reveal it
being reasonable will leave you full of bullets pull it squeeze it
till its empty tempt me push me pussies
i need a good reason to give this trigger a good squeeze

im a soldier
these shoulders hold up so much
they wont budge ill never fall or fold up
im a soldier
even if my collar bones crush or crumble
i will never slip or stumble

im a soldier
these shoulders hold up so much
they wont budge ill never fall or fold up
im a soldier
even if my collar bones crush or crumble
i will never slip or stumble

i love pissing you off it gets me off
like my lawyers when the fucking judge lets me off
all you motherfuckers gotta do is set me off
im violating all the motherfucking bets be off

im a lit fuse anything i do bitch is news
pistol whipping mother fucker bouncer 62
who needs bullets as soon as i pull it you sweat bullets 
an excellent method to get rid of the next bully

its actually better cause instead of you murdering
you can hurt em then come back again and kick dirt in them
its like pouring salt in your wounds assault and get sued
you can smell the lawsuits as soon as i waltz in the room

everybodys hearts just stop they call the cops
all you see is bitches coming out their halter tops
running and ducking at the hot rocks parking lot
youll all get shot whether its your fault or not

cause im a soldier
these shoulders hold up so much
they wont budge ill never fall or fold up
im a soldier
even if my collar bones crush or crumble
i will never slip or stumble

im a soldier
these shoulders hold up so much
they wont budge ill never fall or fold up
im a soldier
even if my collar bones crush or crumble
i will never slip or stumble

i spit it slow so these kids know that im talking to em
give it back to these damn critics and sock it to em
im like a thug with a little bit of pac influence
i spew it and look how i got you bitches rocking to it

you motherfuckers could never do it like i can do it
dont even try youll look stupid do not pursue it
dont ever in your life try to knock the truest
i spill the illest shit ever could drive me to it

so ticky-tock listen as the sound ticks on the clock
listen to the sound of kim as she licks on the cock
listen to the sound of me spilling my heart through this pen
motherfuckers know that ill never be marshall again

full of controversy until i retire my jersey
til the fire inside dies and expires at 30
and lord have mercy on anymore of these rappers that verse me
and put a curse on authorities in the face of adversity

im a soldier
these shoulders hold up so much
they wont budge ill never fall or fold up
im a soldier
even if my collar bones crush or crumble
i will never slip or stumble

im a soldier
these shoulders hold up so much
they wont budge ill never fall or fold up
im a soldier
even if my collar bones crush or crumble
i will never slip or stumble

i thought i had it all figured out i did
i thought i was tough enough to stick it out with kim
but i wasnt tough enough to juggle two things at once
i found myself laying on my knees in cuffs

which shouldve been a reason enough for me to get my stuff and just leave
how come i couldnt see this shit myself its just me
nobody couldnt see the shit i felt
knowin damn well she wasnt gonna be there when i fell

to catch me the minute she was heated she just bailed
im standin and swingin on like 30 people by myself
i couldnt even see the millimeter when it fell
turned around saw gary stashin a heater in his belt

saw the bouncers rush him and beat him to the ground
i just sold two million records i dont need to go to jail
im not about to lose my freedom over no female
i need to slow down try to get my feet on solid ground

so for now im
sayin goodbye im sayin goodbye to hollywood

bury my face in comic books cause i dont wanna look
at nothing this worlds too much i swallowed all i could
if i could swallow a bottle of tylenol i would
and end it for good just say goodbye to hollywood

i prolly should these problems are pilin at once
cause everything that bothers me i got it bottled up
i think im bottoming out but im not about to give up
i gotta get up thank god i got a little girl

now im a responsible father and not alotta good
id be to my daughter layin in the bottom of the mud
must be in my blood cause i dunno how i do it
all i know is i dont want to follow in the footsteps

 of my dad
cuz i hate him so bad
the worst fear that i had was growing up to be like his fuckin ass

publicity stunt my ass consume my fuckin dick

fuck the guns im done ill never look at gats
if i scrap ill scrap like i aint never wooped some ass
i love my fans but no one ever puts a grasp
on the fact ive sacrificed everything i have

i never dreamt id get to the level that im at
this is wack this is more then i ever coulda asked
everywhere i go i had a sweater hood or mask
what about math how come i wasnt ever good at that

its like the boy in a bubble who never could adapt
im trapped if i could go back i never wouldve rapped
i sold my soul to the devil ill never get it back
i just wanna leave this game with level head intact

imagine going from bein a no one to seein everything blow up
and all you did was grow up mcin
its fuckin crazy cause all i wanted was to give hailie the life i never had
instead i forced us to live alienated

yo i woke up fucked up off the liquor i drunk 
i had a bag of the skunk one and last nights tunk 
pussy residue was on my penis denise from the cleaners 
fucked me good you shouldve seen us 

big booty bitch switch unbearable french role styling
body like a stallion 
sizing up the figure while my shit getting bigger 
debating on to fuck her do i wanna be a nigga 

caressing this bitch plus im checking out them tits
sipping on that fine shit i aint use to buying
i gotta hit it from behind its mandatory
like taking hos money but thats another story

for surely your pussy on toast after we toast
her clothes fell like bishop and juice
the womb beater clean pussy eater inserting my john
in that spot hotter than the hottest block dont stop

response i got when i was knocking it
clocks steading ticking kinky finger licking
the cannon semens at my tip when she moans
i gotta slow down before i cum soon

and work that nigga like a slave owner
when i dropped off my outfit she knew i wanted to bone her
she foaming at the lips the ones between her hips
pubic hairs looking like some sour cream dip
 
without the nacho my dick hit the spot though 
pussy tighter than conditions of us black folks 
me in the final stretch the last part of sex
i bust a fat ass nut then i woke up next

like what the fuck is going on here this bitch evaporated
pussy and all just picked up and vacated
and now im frustrated cause my dick was unprotected
and doctor wesley telling me i aint really got that shit
fuck

fucking chickens with no ribs 
thats why i aint got no time

and shes pregnant but shes egging me on begging me to throw her
off the steps on this porch my only weapon is force
 
and i dont wanna resort to violence of any sort
but whats she shoving me for doesnt she love me no more
wasnt she hugging me four minutes ago at the door
man im this close to going toe to toe with this whore

what would you do if she was telling you she wants a divorce
shes having another baby in a month and its yours
and you find it isnt cause this bitch has been visiting
someone else and sucking his dick and kissing you on the lips

when you get back to michigan now the plot has thickened in worse 
cause you feel like youve been sticking your fucking dick in a hurse
so your paranoid at every little cold that you get
ever since they sold you this shit youve been holding your dick

so you go to the clinic sweating every minute youre in it
then the doctor comes out looking like dennis the menace *laughs*
and its obvious to everyone in the lobby its aids
he aint even gotta to call in you the office to say it

so you jet back home cause you gon get that ho
and when you see her youre gon bend her fucking neck back yo
cause you love her you never wouldve expect that blow
obie told you to scoop how could she stoop that low

jesus i dont believe this bitch works at the cleaners
bringing me home diseases swinging from obies penis
shes so deceiving shit this hos a genius she gd us

thats why i aint got no time 
for these games and stupid tricks 
or these bitches on my dick

i said this looks like a job for me
so everybody just follow me
cause we need a little controversy
cause it feels so empty without me 

little hellions kids feeling rebellious
embarrassed their parents still listen to elvis
they start feeling like prisoners helpless
till osama comes along on a mission and yells bitch

a visionary vision is scary
could start a revolution pollutin the air waves 
a rebel so let me just revel and bask
in the fact that i got everyone kissin my ass

and its a disaster such a catastrophe
for you to see so damn much of my ass you ask for me
well im back - na-na na-na na-na na-na na-na
fix your bent antenna tune it in and then im gonna enter in it 

up under your skin like a splinter
the center of attention back for the winter
im interesting the best thing since wrestling
infesting in your kids ears and nesting

testing attention please
feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
heres my 10 cents my 2 cents is free
a nuisance who sent you sent for me 

now this looks a job for me
so everybody just follow me

ive been dope suspenseful with a pencil
ever since prince turned himself into a symbol

but sometimes the shit just seems
everybody only wants to discuss me
so this must mean im disgusting
but its just me im just obscene hey

though im not the first king of controversy
i am the worst thing since elvis presley
to do black music so selfishly
and use it to get myself wealthy hey

theres a concept that works
20 million other white rappers emerge
but no matter how many fish in the sea
itll be so empty without me

now this looks a job for me
so everybody just follow me
cause we need a little controversy
cause it feels so empty without me 

i said this looks like a job for me
so everybody just follow me

kidsem whats goin on this is paul rosenberg your faithful attorney at law
listen i listened to the rough copy of your album and uhh you know i just gotta be honest with you
could you tone it down a little bit because theres only so much i can explain
gimme a callthese ideas are nightmares to white parents
whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings
like whatever they say has no bearing
its so scary in a house that allows no swearing

to see him walking around with his headphones blaring
alone in his own zone cold and he dont care
hes a problem child and what bothers him all comes out
when he talks about his fuckin dad walkin out

cause he hates him so bad that he blocks him out
but if he ever saw him again hed probably knock him out
his thoughts are whacked hes mad so hes talkin back
talkin black brainwashed from rock and rap

he sags his pants do-rags and a stocking cap
his stepfather hit him so he socked him back
and broke his nose his house is a broken home
theres no control he just lets his emotions go

chorus from aerosmiths dream on
come on sing with me sing for the year sing it
for the laughter sing for the tear come on
sing it with me if its just for today
maybe tomorrow the good lord will take you away

entertainment is changin intertwinin with gangstas
in the land of the killers a sinners mind is a sanctum
holy or unholy only have one homie
only this gun lonely cause dont anyone know me

yet everybody just feels like they can relate
i guess words are a motherfucker they can be great
or they can degrade or even worse they can teach hate
its like these kids hang on every single statement we make

like they worship us plus all the stores ship us platinum
now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen
from standin on corners and porches just rappin
to havin a fortune no more kissin ass

but then these critics crucify you journalists try to burn you
fans turn on you attorneys all want a turn at you
to get they hands on every dime you have
they want you to lose your mind every time you mad

so they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon
any dispute wont hesitate to produce handguns
thats why these prosecutors wanna convict me
strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly

but all they kids be listenin to me religiously
so im signin cds while police fingerprint me
theyre for the judges daughter but his grudge is against me
if im such a fuckin menace this shit doesnt make sense b

its all political if my music is literal
and im a criminal how the fuck can i raise a little girl
i couldnt i wouldnt be fit to
youre full of shit too guerrera that was a fist that hit you

come on sing with me sing for the year sing that shit
for the laughter sing for the tears sing with me
sing it with me if its just for today
maybe tomorrow the good lord will take you away

they say music can alter moods and talk to you
well can it load a gun up for you and cock it too
well if it can then the next time you assault a dude
just tell the judge it was my fault and ill get sued

see what these kids do is hear about us totin pistols
and they want to get one cause they think the shits cool
not knowin we really just protectin ourselves we entertainers
of course the shits affectin our sales you ignoramus

but music is reflection of self we just explain it
and then we get our checks in the mail its fucked up aint it
how we can come from practically nothing
to being able to have any fuckin thing that we wanted

thats why we sing for these kids who dont have a thing
except for a dream and a fuckin rap magazine
who post pin-up pictures on their walls all day long
idolize they favorite rappers and know all they songs

or for anyone whos ever been through shit in they lives
till they sit and they cry at night wishin theyd die
till they throw on a rap record and they sit and they vibe
were nothin to you but were the fuckin shit in they eyes

thats why we seize the moment try to freeze it and own it
squeeze it and hold it cause we consider these minutes golden
and maybe theyll admit it when were gone just let our spirits live on
through our lyrics that you hear in our songs and we can

sing with me sing for the year sing it
for the laughter sing for the tears come on
sing it with me if its just for today
maybe tomorrow the good lord will take you away

sing with me sing for the year sing it
for the laughter sing for the tears come on

i wanna fuckinsing 
cause im happy 
yeah im happy 
ha ha 
i got my baby back 
yo check it out 

some days i sit starin out the window
watchinthis world pass me by
sometimes i think theres nothin to live for
i almost break down and cry

somtimes i think im crazy
im crazy oh so crazy
why am i here am i just wasting my time
but then i see my baby
suddenly im not crazy
it all makes sense when i look into her eyes

cause somtimes it feels like the worlds on my shoulders
everyones leanin on me
cause sometimes it feels like the worlds almost over
but then she comes back to me

my baby girl keeps gettin older
i watch her grow up with pride
people make jokes cause they dont understand me
they just dont see my real side

i act like shit dont phase me
inside it drives me crazy
my insecurities could eat me alive
but then i see my baby
suddenly im not crazy
it all makes sense when i look into her eyes

cause somtimes it feels like the worlds on my shoulders
everyones leanin on me
cause sometimes it feels like the worlds almost over
but then she comes back to me

man if i could sing id keep singing this song to my daughter
if i could hit the notes id blow something as long as my father
to show her how i feel about her how proud i am that i got her
god im a daddy im so glad that her mom didnt want her

now you probly get this picture from my public persona
that im a pistol-packing drug-addict who bags on his mama
but i wanna just take this time out to be perfectly honest
cause theres a lot of shit i keep bottled that hurts deep inside o my soul

and just know that i grow colder the older i grow
this boulder on my shoulder gets heavy and harder to hold
and this load is like the weight of the world
and i think my neck is breaking should i just give up
or try to live up to these expectations

now look i love my daughter more than life in itself
but i got a wife thats determined to make my life livin hell
but i handle it well given the circumstances im dealt
so many chances man its too bad coulda had someone else

but the years that ive wasted are nothing to the tears that ive tasted
so heres what im facin 3 felonies 6 years of probation
ive went to jail for this woman ive been to bat for this woman
ive taken bats to peoples backs bent over backwards for this woman

man i shoulda seen it comin whyd i stick my penis up in
woulda ripped the pre-nup up if id seen what she was fuckin
but fuck it its over theres no more reason to cry no more
i got my baby baby the only lady that i adore hailie

so sayonara try tomorra nice to know ya
my babys travelled back to the arms of her rightful owner
and suddenly it seems that my shoulder blades have just shifted
its like the greatest gift you can get the weight has been lifted

now it dont feel like the worlds on my shoulders
everyones leaninon me
cause my baby knows that her daddys a soldier
nothin can take her from me

woo 
i told you i cant sing 
oh well i tried 
hailie member when i said 
if you ever need anything daddy will be right there 
well guess what 
daddys here 
and i aint goin nowhere baby

if there aint shit for me to feed off im see-saw battlin

man i hate this crap
this aint rap this is crazy the way we act 
when we confuse hip hop with real life when the music stops

swifty
aint no getting rid of mcveigh if so you woulda tried 
the only way im leavin this bitch is suicide
i have died clinically arrived back at my enemies 
crib with hennessey got drunk then i finish he
im every niggas favorite arch enemy 
physically fitted to be the most dangerous nigga with beef
i spark willingly with a dillinger in the dark dilligently 
im not what you think 
i appear to be fucked up mentally endangered
i cant stay away from a razor
i just want my face in a paper
i wish a nigga had a grenade to squeeze tight to awake neighbors for acres
ill murder you i gauge to have me turn into 
a mad man son of sam bitch im surgical
im allergic to dyin you think not
you got balls we can see how large when the music stops

kon artis
i was happy havin a deal at first
thought money would make me happy but it only made my pain worse
it hurts when you see your friends turn their back on you dog
and you aint got nothin left but your word and your balls
and youre stressed from the calls of your new friends
beggin with their hands out checkin for your record when its sellin
when it aint thats the end no laughs no friends
no girls just the gin you drink till your car spin
you think damn when you slam into the wall and you fall out the car 
and try to crawl with one arm 
im bout to lose it all in a pool of alcohol
if my funerals tomorrow wonder would they even call when the music stops

von
lets see how many of your men loyal
when i pull up lookin for you with a pistol sippin a can of penzoil
im revved up who said what when lead bust 
your head just explode with red stuff im handcuffed
tossed in the paddywagon braggin about how you shouted 
like a coward bullets devoured you showered you niggas
if i was you niggas id run while given a chance
understand i can enhance the spirit of man
death itself it can hurt me
just the thought of dyin alone that really irks me
you aint worthy to speak thoughts of cheap talk be smart
and stop tryin to walk how gs walk before we spark
hug the floor while we playin tug-of-war with your life 
fuck a tour and a mike id rather fuck a whore with a knife
deliver that shit that coroners like you hype 
poppin shit in broad daylight nigga youre a goner at night when the music stops

proof
instigators turn pits in cages 
let loose and bit the neighbors wrist to razors
yall dont want war yall want talk 
in the dark my dogs all bark like woof
proof nigga ima wolf get your whole roof
caved in like reindeer hooves
stomp the booth shake the floor tiles loose
the more yall breath shit the more i moves
its hill street this is hardcore blues
put a gun to rap checkin all our dues
nigga or make the news betcha all yall move
when the uzi pop you better drop when the music stop

bizarre
music has changed my life in so many ways
brains confused been fucked since the fifth grade
ll told me to rock the bells 
nwa said fuck the police now im in jail
93 was strictly r&amp;b 
fucked up haircut listenin to jodeci
michael jackson who gonna tell me i aint mike 
ass cheeks painted white fuckin priscilla tonight
flyin down sunset smokin crack
transvestite in the front eddie murphy in the back
mop had me grimy and gritty 
marilyn manson i died my hair blue and grew some titties
ludacris told me to throw them bows

when i see you ima step on you and not even know it

you midget mini-me with a buncha little mini-yous
runnin round your backyard swimmin pools
over 80 million records sold
and i aint have to do it with 10 or 11 year olds 

eminem
cause what you say is what you say
say what you say how you say it whenever you sayin it
just remember how you said it when you was sprayin it
so who you playin with huh huh huh huh 

cause what you say is what you say
say what you say how you say it whenever you sayin it
just remember how you said it when you was sprayin it
so who you playin with huh huh huh huh 

second verse it gets worse it gets no better than this
amatuers drink veteran piss from a dixie cup if you ever mix me up
or confuse me with a cannabis or dre with a dupri
will rub it in every club your in well have you
black balled and make sure you never rap-a-fuckin-gain
dre aint havin it as long as im here play devils advocate 

dr dre
if there was some magic shit i could wave
over the indusrty that could save it when im gone
and buried to make sure the tradition carries on
i would 

eminem
if i could only use this power for good
i wouldnt not even if i could 

dr dre
from the hood and im a hornet
and ima only sting when im cornered 

eminem
and ima only sucker punch and swing without warnin
and swing to knock somebodys fuckin head off
cause i know when they get up i wont get a chance to let off

another punch im punk-rock no ones punk
dont give a fuck white-pac so much spunk
when i was little i knew i would blow up
and sell a mill or grow up to be atilla
go nuts and be a killer 

dr dre
and im somethin of a phenom
one puff of the chron
im unstoppable im alive and on top again
theres no obstacle that i cant conquer
so come along with us cmon 

eminem
cause what you say is what you say
say what you say how you say it whenever you sayin it
just remember how you said it when you was sprayin it
so who you playin with huh huh huh huh 

cause what you say is what you say
say what you say how you say it whenever you sayin it
just remember how you said it when you was sprayin it
so who you playin with huh huh huh huh 

dr dre
now anybody who knows dre
knows im about fast cars and alize partyin all day
but i handle my business cause it work before play
dont look for trouble but ill serve you gourmet

however you want it you could have it your way
you fuck my night up ima fuck up your day
bullet with your name sendin it your way
that goes for anyone who walks thru that doorway

cause this is my space you invade it
live to regret it and you die tryin to violate it
fuck around and youll get annihilated
eyes dilated 

eminem
like my old lady

cause what you say is what you say
sometimes what you mean is 2 different things
depending on your mood if it swings think too many things
little hit of dres weed i can do anything

catch a contact then im gone and im back
i speed write and my loose-leafs my lanch pad 

dr dre
and i can pull any string
dont have to prove anything

catch a contract on your head
you headed west talk shit about dre
you better get a vest then invest in something
to protect your head and neck 

eminem
and its back and forth all day like red and meth
i joke when i say im the best in the booth
but a lot of truth is said in jest
and if i ever do live to be a legend
ima die a sudden death 5 mics in the source
aint holdin my fuckin breath
but i suffocate for the respect
fore i breath to collect a fuckin check 

cause what you say is what you say
say what you say how you say it whenever you sayin it
just remember how you said it when you was sprayin it
so who you playin with huh huh huh huh 

cause what you say is what you say

just remember how you said it when you was sprayin it
so who you playin with huh huh huh huh 

dr dre
watch your fuckin mouth 

timbaland
yo this timbaland tell him i said suck ti-tick my dick[intro eminem]
cause sometimes you just feel tired
feel weak and when you feel weak you feel like you wanna just give up
but you gotta search within you you gotta find that inner strength
and just pull that shit out of you and get that motivation to not give up
and not be a quitter no matter how bad you wanna just fall flat on your face and collapse

[b/w intro]
yo left yo left yo left right left
yo left yo left yo left right left
yo left yo left yo left right left
yo left yo left yo left right left

[verse #1 eminem]
till i collapse i’m spilling these raps long as you feel em
till the day that i drop youll never say that im not killing them
cause when i am not then ima stop penning em
and i am not hip-hop and i’m just not eminem
subliminal thoughts when im stop sending them women are caught in webs spin and hauk venom
adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illing to stop
amoxacilin is just not real enough
the criminal cop killing hip-hop filling a minimal swap to cop millions of pac listeners
youre coming with me feel it or not you’re gonna fear it like i showed you the spirit of god lives in us
you hear it a lot lyrics that shock is it a miracle or am i just a product of pop fizzing up
for sizzle my whizzle this is the plot listen up you bizzles forgot slizzle does not give a fuck

[chorus - natedogg]
till the roof comes off till the lights go out
till my legs give out can’t shut my mouth
till the smoke clears out - am i high perhaps
ima rip this shit till my bone collapse
till the roof comes off till the lights go out
till my legs give out can’t shut my mouth
till the smoke clears out - am i high perhaps
ima rip this shit till my bone collapse

[verse #2 eminem]
music is like magic there’s a certain feeling you get when youre real
and you spit and people are feeling your shit
this is your moment and every single minute you spend trying to hold onto it
cause you may never get it again
so while you’re in it try to get as much shit as you can
and when your run is over just admit when its at its end
cause im at the end of my wits with half this shit that gets in
i got a list heres the order of my list that its in
it goes reggie jay-z tupac and biggie andre from outkast jada kurupt nas and then me
but in this industry im the cause of a lot of envy so when i’m not put on this list the shit does not offend me
thats why you see me walk around like nothings bothering me
even though half you people got a fucking problem with me
you hate it but you know respect youve got to give me
the presss wet dream like bobby and whitney nate hit me

[chorus - natedogg]
till the roof comes off till the lights go out
till my legs give out can’t shut my mouth
till the smoke clears out - am i high perhaps
ima rip this shit till my bone collapse
till the roof comes off till the lights go out
till my legs give out can’t shut my mouth
till the smoke clears out - am i high perhaps
ima rip this shit till my bone collapse

[verse #3 eminem]
soon as a verse starts i eat it at mc’s heart
what is he thinking how not to go against me smart
and its absurd how people hang on every word
i’ll probably never get the props i feel i ever deserve
but i’ll never be served my spot is forever reserved
if i ever leave earth that would be the death of me first
cause in my heart of hearts i know nothing could ever be worse
that’s why i’m clever when i put together every verse
my thoughts are sporadic i act like i’m an addict
i rap like i’m addicted to smack like i’m kim mathers
but i don’t want to go forth and back in constant battles
the fact is i would rather sit back and bomb some rappers
so this is like a full blown attack i’m launching at them
the track is on some battling raps who want some static
cause i don’t really think that the fact that i’m slim matters
a plaque of platinum status is whack if im not the baddest

[chorus - natedogg]

[outro]
[eminem &amp; natedogg echo]
until the roof until the roof
the roof comes off the roof comes off
until my legs until my legs
give out from underneath me give out form underneath me

[eminem]
i i will not fall
i will stand tall
feels like no one can beat metv presenter 
hello boys and girls 
today were gonna talk about father and daughter relationships 
do you have a daddy

*giggle* 
i think my dad gone crazy 

theres no mountain i cant climb theres no tower too high
no plane that i cant learn how to fly
what do i gotta do to get through to you to show you
there aint nothing i cant take this chainsaw to

fuckin brains brawn and brass balls 
i cut em off then got em pickled and bronzed in a glass jar
inside of a hall with my framed autograph
sunglasses with elton johns name on my drag wall

im out the closet i been lying my ass off 
all this time me and dre been fucking with hats off 

dr dre 
suck it marshall 

eminem 
tell laura and her husband to back off 
before i push this motherfucking button and blast off 

and launch one of these russians and thats all
blow every fucking thing except afghanistan on the map off
we wanna stop we wanna knock the crap off

*knocking* haley tell em baby 

hailie 
my dads lost it 

theres really nothin else to say ha i cant explain it 
i think my dad gone crazy
a little help from hailie jade wont ya tell em maybe 
i think my dad gone crazy
theres nothing you could do or say that could ever change me 
i think my dad gone crazy
theres no one on earth that can save me not even hailie 
i think my dad gone crazy

its like my mother always told me 
*eminem impersinates his mom* rnrnrnrnrnrrrr n codeine 
n goddamit you little motherfucker 
if you aint got nothin nice to say then dont say nothin

er fuck that shit bitch
eat a motherfuckin dick chew on a prick and lick
a million motherfuckin cocks per second
id rather put out a motherfucking gospel record

id rather be a pussy-whipped bitch eat pussy
and have pussy-lips glued to my face with a clit-ring
in my nose then quit bringin my flows
quit giving me my ammo cant you see why im so mean

if yall leave me alone this wouldnt be my mo 
i wouldnt have to go eenie meenie minie mo 
catch a homo by his toe man i dont know no more 
am i the only fuckin one whos normal any more 

hailey 
dad

theres really nothin else to say ha i cant explain it 
i think my dad gone crazy
a little help from hailie jade wont ya tell em maybe 
i think my dad gone crazy
theres nothing you could do or say that could ever change me 
i think my dad gone crazy
theres no one on earth that can save me not even hailie 
i think my dad gone crazy

my songs can make you cry take you by surprise 
and at the same time make you dry your eyes 
with the same rhyme so what youre seeing is a genius at work 
which to me isnt work so its easy to misinter-

pret it at first cuz when i speak its tongue in cheek 
id yank my fuckin teeth 
before id ever bite my tongue id slice my gums
get struck by fuckin lightning twice at once

and die and come back as vanilla ices son
and walk around the rest of my life spit on
and kicked and hit with shit every time i sung
like r kelly as soon as bump n grind comes on 

more pain inside o my brain
than in the eyes of a little girl inside of a plane 
aimed at the world trade standin on ronnys grave
screaming at the sky the clouds gather its [clyde mathers and bonnie jade]

and thats pretty much the gist of it 
parents are pissed but the kids love it 
nine millimeter heaters stashed in two-seaters with meat cleavers 
i dont blame you i wouldnt let hailie listen to me neither 

theres really nothin else to say ha i cant explain it 
i think my dad gone crazy
a little help from hailie jade wont ya tell em maybe 
i think my dad gone crazy
theres nothing you could do or say that could ever change me 
i think my dad gone crazy
theres no one on earth that can save me not even hailie 
i think my dad gone crazy

doesnt take much
for me to race up and stank up
when motherfuckers hate your guts
you dont even gotta say much
for me to put a pen to a blank sheet of paper
like smearin bloodstains with a paint brush
i cant explain what it is my brain does
but however it works its insane just plain nuts
and it aint just my brain thats dangerous
its a whole combination of things
it takes nuts
and im not afraid to raise the stakes up
i got a million bucks in the bank and eight trucks
for anybody who gets on a track and spanks us
im paitently waitin for the day
im anxious
to see the look on your fake mugs when you thugs go bankrupt
youre drunk you aint tough
whatever you drank musta just turned you into some gangstas
this is me talkin motherfucker this aint drugs
you wanna pop shit
wake up
then make up
fuck that
its to late chump now face up
i pray for the day that someone who spits with the calibur that nas and jay does
opens up his jaws to say somethin to rattle my name off
or rattle the first thing from the top of his brain off
so i can blow the fuckin dust off of this chainsaw
and give him the surgery that he came for
till i peel the pain off

ever since me and dre split it 50/50 on 50 
its funny we got a buzz spreadin quicker 
then mankin paper airplanes out of a twenty
fuck money i dont rap with dead presidents
id rather see the president dead
its never been said but i set precedents
and the standards and they cant stand it
my name shoulda been bastard the shit shoulda been plastered
on my forhead with a stamp i shoulda been blasted
i shoulda been had a cap put in my ass
but im too swift and fast for that im past it
im too old to go and cruise gratiot 
fuck that shit i dun seen how fast this rap shit

snap click but this time i got the fuckin au-to-ma-tic
and no one gon test this mind clack click

chorus
we as americans us as a citizen gotta protect ourselves
look at how shit has been we better check ourselves
livin up in these streets through worse and through better health
survivin by any means; we as americans us as a citizen
we are samaritans what did we get us in
we better check ourselves look at how shit has been

verse 3
i got a secret if you can keep it between us
i tuck two ninas under my jeans either side of my penis
under my long johns under my sean johns
one run in with the long arm of the law im long gone
ima do five years no less then that no questions asked
what might be a good idea that i stop right here
and quit while im ahead already in the red
already got a steady infrared meant for my head
a target on my back bigger problems than that
bin laden on my ass he probably gon send the task
i aint gon even ask they aint gon let me pack
they aint gon give me my semi but i got my  mack

chorus
we as americans us as a citizen gotta protect ourselves
look at how shit has been we better check ourselves
livin up in these streets through worse and through better health
survivin by any means; we as americans us as a citizen
we are samaritans what did we get us in

take a look where you live
this is america and we are americansthe more you put me through
the more it makes me wanna come back to you
you say you hate me i just love you more
you dont want me i just want you more

i buy you flowers you throw em at me
i know its sad but its making me happy
the more that you slap me the more that it turns me on
because you love me and i love you more

its sick but who could ever predict wed be doin the same shit
we say that we do it for our baby but we dont we do it for us
its lust cause neither one of us trusts each other so we fuck
till we bust till cuss each other out we know what its about
shout till i throw you out the house you throw me out the house
i throw you on the couch punch you in the mouth
we fist fight till we turn this mother out and apologize after laughter
pain its insane were back in the same chapter again
and its sad but its true when im laying here with you
there aint nothing anyone could ever say or ever do

cause the more you put me through
the more it makes me wanna come back to you
you say you hate me i just love you more
you dont want me i just want you more

i buy you flowers you throw em at me
i know its sad but its making me happy
the more that you slap me the more that it turns me on
because you love me and i love you more

cause i hate you do you hate me 
good cause youre so fuckin beautiful when youre angry
it makes me wanna just take you and just throw you
on the bed and fuck you like i dont even know you

you fuck other people and i fuck other people
youre a slut but im equal im a mutt were both evilin our ways 
but neither one of us would ever admit it
cause one of us would have one up on the other so forget it

we can make accusations people spread rumours
but they aint got proof till they do its just the two of us
you and me cause any chick can say that shes screwin me
but you gotta believe it to a degree cuz true indeed
if you didnt i wouldnt be hittin yeah i would 
cuz the sex is too damn good if i ran who would i run to
that would be this soft and warm so its off and on
usually more off then on but at least we know that we
share this common bond youre the only one i can fuck
without a condom on i hope the only reason that i cope
is cuz of that fact and i can bust in that and thats why

the more you put me through
the more it makes me wanna come back to you
you say you hate me i just love you more
you dont want me i just want you more
i buy you flowers you throw em at me
i know its sad but its making me happy
the more that you slap me the more that it turns me on
because you love me and i love you more


i can never understand it thats why i dont try
from junior high until we both die you silly hoe why must we try
is it really so rough that we must always call each others billy goats gruff

try to pull each others legs until the other begs
were lying to ourself thats the beauty of it yeah
cause we truly love each other thats why we always fight
and all we do is shove each other every other fuckin night

and its clear it aint gonna change this pinned up rage
we both have we both feel like weve been upstaged
by someone else we both been someone elses someone else
the problem is neither one wants help

its an addiction
and it cant be fixed our familys mixed up
theres a baby sister in the mix and it hurts
cause the pieces to the puzzle dont fit
and anybody who thinks he knows us doesnt know shit

and theyre probably just tired of hearing it all the time on every song
every lyric and every rhyme all the hoopla all of the woopty woo
what you put me through fuckin woopty do

but i wont be made a fool of if this is true love
you wouldnt do what you did last time you wouldnt screw up
this time cause this time girl im tellin you what
you do it again and im fuckin you up 

no matter what you say what you do
ima hunt you down till i find you
no matter where you run ill be right there
right behind you in your nightmares

so much for them flowers and the candy
all the times that you threw it back at me
told me you hate me you gon hate me more
when you find out you cant escape me whore

the more you put me through
the more it makes me wanna come back to you
you say you hate me i just love you more
you dont want me i just want you more
i buy you flowers you throw em at me
i know its sad but its making me happy
the more that you slap me the more that it turns me on
because you love me and i love you moreintro

so in two seconds flat dres at my crib 
only thing is we both know where this kid lives 
and neither one of us have canadian citizenship 
shit oh dre wait a mintue thats it 
all we gotta do is use a bit of turbo boost 
we can fly over the border lets go whoosh 
so were off to toronto and were gainin speed 
*pfftt arghh* what was that oh jermaine dupre fuck it 
keep goin no time to waste 
wait backup hit him one more time in case okay 
fuck now hes draggin under the car 
oh well only 30 more thousand miles 
meanwhile me and dre are tryin to conversate 
just tryin to find a reason for the constant hatin 
and tryin to figure out what happened to jermaine propaine 
he couldnt have fell of that hard aint no way 

what happened to the way you was rappin 
when you was scandalous then canabis turned into a television evangelist 

plus he raps with his regular voice 
*pft pft pft pft* what was that pet shop boys 
so we pull up to the bridge where he last was spotted 
his corpse was still movin but his ass was rotted 
he kind of smelled a little like courtney love 
i figured if i stick him with a fork hes done 
so i stapped him twice kept jabbin christ 
he wont die this guys like a battered wife 
hes like kim he keeps comin back for more 
but he wont fight back i cracked his jaw 
hold up bis quit foldin up 
punch me in the chest make my shoulders touch 
do somethin at least one punch line 
cmon till the meter reads 9-9-9-tey-nine percent of my fans are blonde 
bis cmon answer me man respond 
tell me bout the sun rain moon and stars 
intergalatic or metaphors from mars 
raw to the floor raw like resovoir dogs 
bite another line from red mans song 
suddenly the stub of a dead mans arm from a midget 
reaches out from under the car 
its jd this motherfucker wont die neither 
dre starts sprayin him with cans of ether *sshhhh* 
we stomped the bitch and then stopmed the bitch again 
compton detroit bitch talk some shit again 
stomp him switch feet 
stomp him switch again 
dre alright hes dead dawg quit kickin him 
i think stan-abis jumped off the bridge again arghhhhhhdamn 
he disappeared yo hes gone he did it again 

chorusyo 
check it out 
its fucked up 
cuz i dont see either one of us budgin 

verse 1 
im with-holding my anger 
though id like to be the strangler 
of this punk ass little pussys punie neck 
its my right to insist 
that he acknowledge my existence 
but he just displays complete lack of respect 
thats when he says to himself as he 
uses his magazines to trash me 
as he sits with both his feet up at his desk 
smokes a bag of his weed 
and starts imagining things 
and he just cant see that hes manically depressed 
and in his jealousy and envy 
it just whirls him in a frenzy 
as he turns on mtv and sees my face 
and he dont exist in his world 
so he just twists and he twirls 
spirals and spins till he hurls himself into rage 
and its destroying him slowly 
cuz he does not even know me 
even though he sees me everywhere he goes 
so he just tortures himself 
he has no fortune and wealth 
so he extorts someone else to get his dough 
and now hes acting like a bully 
so he tries to push and pull me 
but he knows that he cant fool me so hes mad 
he has no choice but to scream 
and raise his voice up at me 
cuz it annoys him to see that i aint scared 

chorus 
you aint no muthafuckin 
buuully 
and i aint bowing to no muthafuckin 
buuully 
i wont allow it aint no coward to no 
buuully 
ill be damned if i dont stand up to a 
buuully 
fight like a man and throw my hands up to a 
buuullyyyyyyyy 

and i know it must be fuckin with you emotionallyyyyyyyy 

verse 2 
now im not tryin to make no more enemies 
no more unfortunately 
theres so many other muthafuckas that just are 
they just keep houndin at me 
now that im down wit 50 
suddenly now i got beef with this faggot ja 
but his ass is such a puppet 
irv could shove his whole hand up it 
and just make him say what he wants him to say 
but suge has irv on a string 
and irvs so nervous that he 
says anything to this man to keep him at bay 
so now ja thinks that hes so tough 
and murder incs the big bad wolf 
and they go huff and puff 
and blow our label down 
but our buildings made out of bricks 
so you aint takin our shit 
and dawg you just did a song with bobby brown 
so now you try to pull the race card 
and it backfires in your face hard 
cuz you know we dont play that black and white shit 
plus that stylist that you fucked 
when you was extacyd up 
was just a man whos dressed up 
as a white bitch 

chorus x1 
you must be takin too much eeeeeeeeee 

verse 3 
now what bothers me the most 
about hip hop is we so close 
to pickin up where we left off with big and pac 
we just lost jam master jay 
big l got blasted away 
plus we lost bugs snake tongue and freaky tah 
its like a neverending cycle 
that just seems to come full circle 
everybodies gotta be so fuckin hard 
and im not excluding myself 
cuz i been stupid as well 
i been known to lose it when someone says something smart 
but as we grow as men we learn 
to let shit go but then again 
theres only so much bullshit we can really stand 
we all got reps to up hold 
when someone steps on our toe 
its no exception it goes for every man 
but if irv really gave a fuck 
about ja like he claims he does 
and wake him up and make his boy get off them drugs 
they just keep feeding him pills 
so if that e doesnt kill him 
someone from g unit will and i aint buzzed 
dawg im talkin to you straight 
if the situation escalates and worse 
were gonna lose another soldier to this game 
and if i get killed for this rap 
i got a million in cash 
that says i will get you back in haileys name 

chorus x1 

irv go get your boy up off that eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee 

get at me dawg hollagood mornin
haha wake your mother fuckin asses up
hey yo what is the what
well come on in you know what time it is
stop sleepin on my group bitch

for whatever its worth its worth me havin my ass whipped
cause ima have the last lips to ever get ass squished
i just cant get past these little pissants
that wanna be brauny bad asses so bad
and they so mad they cant stand it
cause we can and they cant spit haawk
and they cant handle it like a man
and thats when it just happens
and i snap then its a wrap then its a scrap 
an it isnt rap is it
hip-hop isnt a sport anymore when you got to go and resort back into that shit
maybe im old fashioned but my passion 
is to smash anyone rappin without havin a slappin 
believe me id much rather lift a pencil than a pistol when im pissed now
but it all depends on just how far it gets took on the mic
cause im tellin you right now your not gonna like it
cause if i get pushed over the edge then im pullin you with me
you poke a stick at a bit boy you get bit b
these words stick to you like crazy glue
when you diss me cause they just bounce off me like bullets do 50
im the beatiful-est thing and your gonna miss me when im gone
like kieth murry when he threw a stool and hit a girl accidently argghhh
i do this for swifty

today were going to learn how to poison squirrels

but first id like you to meet my friend bob huh
say hi bob hi bob bobs 30 and still lives with his mom
he dont got a job cause bob sits at home and smokes pot
but his 12 year old brother looks up to him an awful lot

and bob likes to hang out at the local waffle spot
and wait in the parking lot for waitresses off the clock
when its late and the lot gets dark and fake like he walks his dog
drag em in the woods and goes straight to the chopping block

and even if they escaped and they got the cops
the ladies would all be just so afraid theyd drop the charge
till one night mrs stacy went off the job
when she felt someone grab hold of her face and said not to talk

but stacy knew it was bob and said knock it off
but bob wouldnt knock it off cause hes crazy and off his rocker
crazy good as slim shady is off the block uh
you couldnt even take him to dres to give bob a doctor

grabbed stacy by the legs and chopped them off her
and dropped her off in the lake for the cops to find her
but ever since the day stacy went off to wander they never found her
and bob still hangs at the waffle diner

and thats the story of bob and his marijuana and what it might do to you
so see if the squirrels want it its bad for you

mr mackey impersonation eminem
see children drugs are bad come on
and if you dont believe me ask your dad raise your hand
and if you dont believe him ask your mom thats right
shell tell you how she does him all the time she will
 
so kids say no to drugs thats right
so you dont act like everyone else does uh huh
and theres really nothing else to say sing along
drugs are just bad mkay



my penis is the size of a peanut have you seen it
fuck no you aint seen it its the size of a peanut huh
speaking of peanuts you know what else is bad for squirrels
ecstasy its the worst drug in the world

if someone ever offers it to you dont do it
kids two hitsll probably drain all your spinal fluid
and spinal fluid is final you wont get it back
so dont get attached itll attack every bone in your back

meet zach 21 years old
after hanging out with some friends at a frat party he gets bold
and decides to try five when hes bribed by five guys
and peer pressure will win every time you try to fight it

suddenly he starts to convulse and his pulse
goes into hyperdrive and his eyes roll back in his skull
his back arches up looks like the mcdonalds arches
hes on donalds carpet layin horizontal barfin

and everyone in the apartment starts laughin at him 
hey adam zach is a jackass look at him 
cause they took it too so they think its funny 
so theyre laughing at basically nothing except maybe wasting their money

meanwhile zachs in a coma the action is over
and his back and his shoulders hunched up like hes practicing yoga 
and thats the story of zach the ecstasy maniac
so dont even feed that to squirrels class cause its bad for you 

mr mackey impersonation eminem
see children drugs are bad thats right
and if you dont believe me ask your dad thats right
and if you dont believe him ask your mom you can
shell tell you how she does him all the time she will
 
so kids say no to drugs smoke crack
so you dont act like everyone else does thats right
and theres really nothing else to say uh huh
drugs are just bad mkay



and last but not least one of the most humongous
problems among young people today is fungus
it grows from cow manure they pick it out wipe if off bag it up
and you put it right in your mouth and chew it yum yum

and then you start to see some dumb stuff
and everything slows down when you eat some of em
and sometimes you see things that arent there like what
like fat women in g-strings with orange hair

mr shady whats a g-string its yarn clair
women stick them up their behinds go out and wear em
and if you swallow too much of the magic mushrooms
whoops did i say magic mushrooms i meant fungus

your tongue gets all swole up like a cows tongue how come
cause it comes from a cows dung
see drugs are bad its a common fact
but your mom and dad know thats all that im good at

but dont be me cause if you grow up and go and od
theyre gonna come for me and ima have to grow a goatee
and get a disguise and hide cause itll be my fault
so dont drugs and do exactly as i dont because im bad for you

mr mackey impersonation eminem
see children drugs are bad uh huh
and if you dont believe me ask your dad put that down
and if you dont believe him ask your mom you can ask
shell tell you how she does him all the time and she will
 
so kids say no to drugs say no
so you dont act like everyone else does like i do
and theres really nothing else to say thats right
drugs are just bad mkay

eminem impersonating mr mackey &amp; eric cartman 
come on children clap along shut up
sing along children suck my motherfuckin dick
drugs are just bad drugs are just bad south park is gonna sue me
so dont do drugs suck my motherfuckin penis
so therell be more for me hippie god damnit
mushrooms killed kennyewww ahhh
so fucked up right nowpsst hey listen

i love my job
it makes me feel like superman
can you fly i can wanna see

im only entertaining you my
goal is to stimulate making you high
and take you and i to a place that you cant see
but i believe you can fly

i dont mean nobody harm im just partyin
im not your dad not your mom not your guardian
just the man whos on the mic
so let me entertain you

my lyrical content is constantly under fire
no wonder why i constantly bomb back
to combat attacks with constant concepts
when lyrics constantly took out of context

failure to communicate with congress
has been a problem for the longest i guess
but maybe one day we can make some progress
food for thought see how long it takes to digest

feeling good when i should be ashamed
shit i really shouldve fell but i stood
see i came like a flame in the night
like a ghost in the dark

theres a ray
theres a light
theres a hope
theres a spark

but when planets collide
theyll never see eye to eye
until they decide
to set their differences aside

and this is why
only one of us will survive
so children follow my lead
and feel the vibe because

im only entertaining you my
goal is to stimulate making you high
and take you and i to a place that you cant see
but i believe you can fly

i dont mean nobody harm im just partyin
im not your dad not your mom not your guardian
just the man whos on the mic
so let me entertain you

my music can be slightly amusing
you shouldnt take lyrics so serious it might be confusing
trying to separate the truth from entertainment
its stupid aint it i get sick of trying to explain it

see i can sit and argue with you but it goes beyond
just being a snot pointy nosed bleached blonde
cause i came here to uplift let your woes be gone
tell em to get fucked and just mosey on

constantly movin constantly using the constitution
as a form of restitution
bless the children nothing less than brilliant
let me entertain you like robbie williams

ill be here when yall are gone rebuilding
world revolving still evolving still slim
how many kids will copy probably millions
but ima do this as a fuckin hobby till then cause

im only entertaining you my
goal is to stimulate making you high
and take you and i to a place that you cant see
but i believe you can fly

i dont mean nobody harm im just partyin
im not your dad not your mom not your guardian
just the man whos on the mic
so let me entertain you

my lyrical content contains subject matter
that sucks up all these fucked up young kids at an
alarmin rate common denominate
add it up and youll see thats why i dominate

i try to stimulate but kids emulate
and mimic every move you make slim youre great
but wait cant you see im only here to entertain
i gotta be the one to go against the grain

cause man i see it feel it live it but its inhumane
for me to see you be influenced and pretend you aint
but they dont understand that ive been through pain
if you get to know me i can be a friend you gain

but you cant just stand there and try to judge
it hurts but your jealousy probably tears you up inside as much
and its such a pleasure every button that i touch
i treasure every glutton that i punish in my lust but

im only entertaining you my
goal is to stimulate making you high
and take you and i to a place that you cant see
but i believe you can fly

i dont mean nobody harm im just partyin
im not your dad not your mom not your guardian
just the man whos on the mic
so let me entertain yougreen lantern

cause we move units uhha 
dont think we aint billin you for this motherfucking studio time 
a matter a fact keep call it a 50 well call it evenlook if you had one shot or one opportunity
to seize everything you ever wanted in one moment
would you capture it or just let it slip

yo his palms are sweaty knees weak arms are heavy
theres vomit on his sweater already moms spaghetti
hes nervous but on the surface he looks calm and ready
to drop bombs but he keeps on forgetting

what he wrote down the whole crowd goes so loud
he opens his mouth but the words wont come out
hes chokin how everybodys jokin now
the clocks runs out times up over blow

snap back to reality oh there goes gravity oh
there goes rabbit he choked hes so mad but he wont
give up that easy no he wont have it he knows
his whole backs to these ropes it dont matter hes dope
 
he knows that but hes broke hes so stagnant he knows
when he goes back to his mobile home thats when its
back to the lab again yo this whole rhapsody
he better go capture this moment and hope it dont pass him

you better lose yourself in the music the moment
you own it you better never let it go
you only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow
this opportunity comes once in a lifetime

you better lose yourself in the music the moment
you own it you better never let it go
you only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow
this opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better

his souls escaping through this hole that is gaping
this world is mine for the taking make me king
as we move toward a new world order
a normal life is boring but super-stardoms

close to postmortem it only grows harder
only grows hotter he blows us all over
these hoes is all on him coast to coast shows
hes known as the globetrotter lonely roads god only knows

hes grown farther from home hes no father
he goes home and barely knows his own daughter
but hold your nose cause here goes the cold water
these hoes dont want him no mo hes cold product

they moved on to the next schmoe who flows
he nose dove and sold nada so the soap opera
is told and unfolds i suppose its old partna
but the beat goes on da da dum da dum da da da dum

you better lose yourself in the music the moment 
you own it you better never let it go 
you only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow 
this opportunity comes once in a lifetime 

you better lose yourself in the music the moment 
you own it you better never let it go
you only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow 
this opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better

no more games imma change what you call rage
tear this motherfuckin roof off like two dogs caged
i was playin in the beginning the mood all changed
i been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage

but i kept rhymin and stepped right in the next cipher
best believe somebodys payin the pied piper
all the pain inside amplified by the
fact that i cant get by with my nine to five

and i cant provide the right type of
life for my family cause man these goddamn
food stamps dont buy diapers
and theres no movie theres no mekhi phifer this is my life

and these times are so hard and its getting even harder
tryin to feed and water my seed plus teeter-totter
caught up between bein a father and a prima donna
baby mama drama screamin on and too much for me to wanna

stay in one spot another day of monotony
has gotten me to the point im like a snail ive got
to formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
success is my only motherfuckin option failures not

mom i love you but this trailers got to go
i cannot grow old in salems lot
so here i go its my shot feet fail me not
this may be the only opportunity that i got

you better lose yourself in the music the moment
you own it you better never let it go
you only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow
this opportunity comes once in a lifetime

you better lose yourself in the music the moment
you own it you better never let it go
you only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow
this opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better

you can do anything you set your mind to manwheres my snare

and i dont wanna be responsible for that
so put the mic down and walk away
you can still have a little bit of dignity

verse 1

i would never claim to be no
ray benzino
an 83 year old fake pacino   
so how can he hold me over some balcony 
without throwing his lower back out
as soon as he goes to lift me
please dont youll probably fall with me
and our asses will both be history
but then again youll finally get your wish
cause youll be all over the street like 50 cent
fucking punk pussy fuck you chump
give me a one-on-one see if i dont fuck you up
tryna jump the ruff ryders and they cut you up
and you put jada on a track thats how much you suck
dick in the industry
swear that you in the streets hustling
you sit behind a fucking desk at the source butt kissing
and begging muthafuckas for guest appearances
and you cant even get the clearance
cause real lyricists dont even respect you or take you serious
its not that we dont like you
we hate you period
talk about a midlife crisis damn
last week you was shaking obie trices hand
now hes a busta what the fucks with that
get on a track dissing us kissing 50s ass
and asking me what i know about indictments bite me
bitch i got two cases and probation fight me
what do i know about standing in front of a judge like a man
ready to take whatever sentence he hands 
what you know about your wife slicing her wrists 
right in front of the only thing you have in this world
a little girl
and ill put that on her
when this is all over
i would never try to make her a star and eat off her
i dont shit about no shopping rocks 
but what you know about hip-hop shops rocking spots
when youre the only white boy up in that bitch just ripping
pressing up your own flyers and your stickers
sticking them bitches up after spending six hours at kinkos 
making copies of your covers of cassette singles
to sell them out of the trunk of your tracer
spending your whole pay check at disc makers
what you know about being bullied over half your life
oh thats right you should know what thats like youre half white
vanilla ice full of beans and rice im eating you alive inside jesus christ
if you that much of a gangsta put the mic down
you should be out killing muthafuckas right now
kill a muthafucka dead kill him dead bitch
shoot him in the fucking head go ahead bitch
slap my mom slap the fuck out of her
she cant sue you she wouldnt get a buck out of you
cause youre broke as fuck you suck 
youre a fucking joke if you was really selling coke 
well then what the fuck you stop for dummy
if you slew some crack
youd make a lot more money than you do from rap
youll never have no security youll never be famous
youll never know what its like to be rich lifes a bitch aint it
raymond here let me me break this shit down in laymans
terms for you just to make sure
that you can understand this and canibus aint using
too many complicated fucking words for you 
here let me slow it down for you so that you can understand if i say it slower
let it go dawg its over

i dont wanna be like this
i dont really wanna hurt no feelings
but im only being real when i say
nobody wants to hear this grandfather rap
and old men have heart attacks 
and i dont wanna be responsible for that
so put the mic down and walk away
you can still have a little bit of dignity

eminem talking
haha talkin about i have muthafuckas calling your crib
bitch you aint even got a fucking crib

fuck you little magazine to i dont need your little fucking magazine 
i got xxls number anyways 
and yall cant stand it cause they gettin bigger than yall

when you was watchin me from what ever fuckin tv you was watching me from
in boston the mean streets of boston
fucking sissy
and you gotta stand up you mutha fucka
suck my mutha fucking dick
oh and for those that dont know
dont get it twisted yall
the source has a white ownerlook if you had one shot or one opportunity
to seize everything you ever wanted in one moment
would you capture it or just let it slip

yo his palms are sweaty knees weak arms are heavy
theres vomit on his sweater already moms spaghetti
hes nervous but on the surface he looks calm and ready
to drop bombs but he keeps on forgetting

what he wrote down the whole crowd goes so loud
he opens his mouth but the words wont come out
hes chokin how everybodys jokin now
the clocks runs out times up over blow

snap back to reality oh there goes gravity oh
there goes rabbit he choked hes so mad but he wont
give up that easy no he wont have it he knows
his whole backs to these ropes it dont matter hes dope
 
he knows that but hes broke hes so stagnant he knows
when he goes back to his mobile home thats when its
back to the lab again yo this whole rhapsody
he better go capture this moment and hope it dont pass him

you better lose yourself in the music the moment
you own it you better never let it go
you only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow
this opportunity comes once in a lifetime

you better lose yourself in the music the moment
you own it you better never let it go
you only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow
this opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better

his souls escaping through this hole that is gaping
this world is mine for the taking make me king
as we move toward a new world order
a normal life is boring but super-stardoms

close to postmortem it only grows harder
only grows hotter he blows us all over
these hoes is all on him coast to coast shows
hes known as the globetrotter lonely roads god only knows

hes grown farther from home hes no father
he goes home and barely knows his own daughter
but hold your nose cause here goes the cold water
these hoes dont want him no mo hes cold product

they moved on to the next schmoe who flows
he nose dove and sold nada so the soap opera
is told and unfolds i suppose its old partna
but the beat goes on da da dum da dum da da da dum

you better lose yourself in the music the moment 
you own it you better never let it go 
you only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow 
this opportunity comes once in a lifetime 

you better lose yourself in the music the moment 
you own it you better never let it go
you only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow 
this opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better

no more games imma change what you call rage
tear this motherfuckin roof off like two dogs caged
i was playin in the beginning the mood all changed
i been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage

but i kept rhymin and stepped right in the next cipher
best believe somebodys payin the pied piper
all the pain inside amplified by the
fact that i cant get by with my nine to five

and i cant provide the right type of
life for my family cause man these goddamn
food stamps dont buy diapers
and theres no movie theres no mekhi phifer this is my life

and these times are so hard and its getting even harder
tryin to feed and water my seed plus teeter-totter
caught up between bein a father and a prima donna
baby mama drama screamin on and too much for me to wanna

stay in one spot another day of monotony
has gotten me to the point im like a snail ive got
to formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
success is my only motherfuckin option failures not

mom i love you but this trailers got to go
i cannot grow old in salems lot
so here i go its my shot feet fail me not
this may be the only opportunity that i got

you better lose yourself in the music the moment
you own it you better never let it go
you only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow
this opportunity comes once in a lifetime

you better lose yourself in the music the moment
you own it you better never let it go
you only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow

since im in a position to talk to these kids and they listen
i aint no politician but ill kick it wit em a minute
cause see they call me a menace; and if the shoe fits ill wear it
but if it dont then yall ll swallow the truth grin and bear it
now whos the king of these rude ludicrous lucrative lyrics
who could inherit the title put the youth in hysterics
usin his music to steer it sharin his views and his merits
but theres a huge interference — theyre sayin you shouldnt hear it
maybe its hatred i spew maybe its food for the spirit
maybe its beautiful music i made for you to just cherish
but im debated disputed hated and viewed in america
as a motherfuckin drug addict — like you didnt experiment
n—now thats when you start to stare at whos in the mirror
and see yourself as a kid again and you get embarrased
and i got nothin to do but make you look stupid as parents
you fuckin do-gooders too bad you couldnt do good at marriage ha ha
and do you have any clue what i had to do to get here i dont
think you do so stay tuned and keep your ears glued to the stereo
cause here we go hes royce hes the king of detroit
and im the sinister mr kiss-my-ass hes just a—

chew up your vest and turn your chest hair to taco-meat
the street continuous to pit quick to smash ya
or flash the clip or give you the picture developed it
click-clock six shots blows through another door
and it gets hot hip-hop quotable tug o war yeah

that shit was raspberry — i got harder two-way alerts

eminem

jesus christ the king of these latter day saints here
to shatter the picture in which of that as they paint me
as a monger of hate satanist scatter-brained athiest
but that aint the case see its a matter of taste
we as a people decide if shadys as bad as they say he is
or is he the latter — a gateway to escape
media scapegoat who they can be mad at today
see its easy as cake simple as whistlin dixie
while im wavin the pistol at sixty christians against me
go to war with the mormons take a bath with the catholics
in holy water — no wonder they try to hold me under longer
im a motherfuckin spiteful delightful eyeful
the new ice cube — motherfuckers hate to like you

its only fair to warn i was born with a set of horns
and metaphors attached to my dang umbilical cord
warlord of rap thatll bash you with a 2 by 4 board
and smash into your honda accord with a four door ford
but im more toward dropping an acapela
to chop a fella to mozerella
worse than a helicopter propeller
got you locked in a cellar with your skeleton showing
developing anorexia while im standing next to ya
eating a full course meal watching you starve to death
with an iv in your vein feeding you liquid darvocet
pumpin you full of drugs
pull the plugs on the gunshot victims full of slugs
so were picked up in an ambulance and driven
to recieving with their asses ripped out of their pants
and given a less than 20 percent chance of livin
have a possible placement as a hospital patient
storing the dead bodies in grandmas little basement
dr kevorkian has arrived to perform an autopsy on you while you scream im still alive
drivin a rusty scalpal in through the top of your scalp
and pullin your adams apple out through your mouth
better call the fire department ive hired an arsonist
to set fire to carpet and burn up your entire apartmentpsst hey listen

i love my job
it makes me feel like superman
can you fly i can wanna see

im only entertaining you my
goal is to stimulate making you high
and take you and i to a place that you cant see
but i believe you can fly

i dont mean nobody harm im just partyin
im not your dad not your mom not your guardian
just the man whos on the mic
so let me entertain you

my lyrical content is constantly under fire
no wonder why i constantly bomb back
to combat attacks with constant concepts
when lyrics constantly took out of context

failure to communicate with congress
has been a problem for the longest i guess
but maybe one day we can make some progress
food for thought see how long it takes to digest

feeling good when i should be ashamed
shit i really shouldve fell but i stood
see i came like a flame in the night
like a ghost in the dark

theres a ray
theres a light
theres a hope
theres a spark

but when planets collide
theyll never see eye to eye
until they decide
to set their differences aside

and this is why
only one of us will survive
so children follow my lead
and feel the vibe because

im only entertaining you my
goal is to stimulate making you high
and take you and i to a place that you cant see
but i believe you can fly

i dont mean nobody harm im just partyin
im not your dad not your mom not your guardian
just the man whos on the mic
so let me entertain you

my music can be slightly amusing
you shouldnt take lyrics so serious it might be confusing
trying to separate the truth from entertainment
its stupid aint it i get sick of trying to explain it

see i can sit and argue with you but it goes beyond
just being a snot pointy nosed bleached blonde
cause i came here to uplift let your woes be gone
tell em to get fucked and just mosey on

constantly movin constantly using the constitution
as a form of restitution
bless the children nothing less than brilliant
let me entertain you like robbie williams

ill be here when yall are gone rebuilding
world revolving still evolving still slim
how many kids will copy probably millions
but ima do this as a fuckin hobby till then cause

im only entertaining you my
goal is to stimulate making you high
and take you and i to a place that you cant see
but i believe you can fly

i dont mean nobody harm im just partyin
im not your dad not your mom not your guardian
just the man whos on the mic
so let me entertain you

my lyrical content contains subject matter
that sucks up all these fucked up young kids at an
alarmin rate common denominate
add it up and youll see thats why i dominate

i try to stimulate but kids emulate
and mimic every move you make slim youre great
but wait cant you see im only here to entertain
i gotta be the one to go against the grain

cause man i see it feel it live it but its inhumane
for me to see you be influenced and pretend you aint
but they dont understand that ive been through pain
if you get to know me i can be a friend you gain

but you cant just stand there and try to judge
it hurts but your jealousy probably tears you up inside as much
and its such a pleasure every button that i touch
i treasure every glutton that i punish in my lust but

im only entertaining you my
goal is to stimulate making you high
and take you and i to a place that you cant see
but i believe you can fly

i dont mean nobody harm im just partyin
im not your dad not your mom not your guardian
just the man whos on the mic
so let me entertain youannouncer 
welcome back to the stage of history 

eminem

im tryin to chop you into pieces and eat you 
wrap you in rope and plastic stab you with broken glass 
and have you with open gashes just strapped to a soakin mattress 
coke and acid black magic cloaks and daggers ahhh 
fuck the planet until it spins on a broken axis 
im so bananas im showin up to your open casket 
to fill it full of explosive gases 
and close it back with a lit match in it 
while i sit back and just hope it catches 
blow you to fragments 
laugh roll you and smoke the ashes 

chorus j-black repeat 2x

j-black

i run a red light then sideswipe a hearse

leave the er then hit a bar for a liquor shot fuck the liver spot 
one day we all gon die 
but when i die ima be so high 
that ima get up and walk leavin the concrete bare 
with the chalk outline still there 
i smoke til i choke and i sex a lot 
i got a cross on my chain but its just to rock 
now if i pray everynight night 
do i still have to hold my tray very tight 
you feel me god i done did so much shit while on earth 
i smoke i drink i curse and to make matters worse 
i bust my gun first and then i chat with your corpse 
since way back i was one to never like back-talk 
see me at the pearly gates in line wearin a northface 
nickle nine at my waist on the lords faith 
angels greet me but i dont reply back 
just show me to my quarters and oh yeah wheres thai at 

chorus 1/2

maxi was seriously wounded but the soul still burns

and of course yo yall know im no stranger to danger 
like christ in a manger feel a whole range of my anger 
i breathe down shit so hard you can see sound 
and beat down these rap clowns in like three rounds 
my pen bout as sharp as a dagger walk with a swagger 
tie your wife to the back of a black jag and i drag her 
ten blocks untie the bitch and i still bag her 
give her a smack in the ass and a six pack of lager 
my shit go as deep and as dark as a train tunnel 
my flows spill like usin the wrong end of a funnel 
everyday i grow more older and more colder 
fly you to colorado roll you over with a boulder 
i know you want to retaliate but you wont dare 
cause you fuckin with some niggaz like this who just dont care

cause when i drop the science motherfuckers tell me to stop the violence
start a fire and block the hydrants
im just a mean person you never seen worse than
so when slim gets this m-16 burstin
you gettin spun backwards like every word of obscene cursin 
on the b-side of my first single with the clean version
stoppin your short life when you still a teen virgin
unless you get a kidney speciman from a spleen surgeon
in the best hospital possible for emergancy surgery
to try to stop the blood from your rushin sternly eternally
ill take it back before we do each others name
run in a ultrasound and snatch you out your mothers frame
ill take it further back than that
back to lovers lane to the night you were started 
cock block your fathers game 
ill plead the fifth like my drawers were muzzled
so suck my dick while i take a shit and do this crossword puzzle
and when im down with ten seconds left then to hope out
ima throw a head-but so hard ill knock us both out

man if i only had half of it if you only knew the half of it

father please forgive me for i know not what i do
i just never had the chance to ever meet you
therefore i did not know that i would grow to be
my mothers evil seed and do these evil deeds

evil deeds while i plant these evil seeds please release me
from these demons i never had any of this shit planned ma please believe
i dont wanna be satans spawn never got the chance to say im sorry
now look at all the pain i caused this santa clause why you not comin this year again

what did i do that was so bad to deserve this everything could have been so perfect 
but life aint a fairytale im about to be hoist up in the air 
forty feet below me theres people everywhere
i dont even know what to feel like they know me cause im in this ferris wheel 

and all i wanna do is go to the mall and take hailie on the carousel 
without this crowd everywhere i go but life is like a merry-go-round 
here we go now do si do now curtains up the show must go now 
ring around the rosie the shows over you can all go home now 

but the curtain just dont close for me this aint how fame was supposed to be 
wheres the switch i could just turn off and on this aint what i chose to be 
so please god give me the strength to have what it takes to carry on 
till i pass 50 back the baton the cameras on my soul is gone 

father please forgive me for i know not what i do
i just never had the chance to ever meet you
therefore i did not know that i would grow to be
my mothers evil seed and do these evil deeds

i said father please forgive me for i know not what i do
i just never had the chance to ever meet you
therefore i did not know that i would grow to be
my mothers evil seed and do these evil deeds

oh

last one baby
let’s go
detroiteminem
theres not much you could do or say to phase me
people think im a little bit crazy
i get it from all angles even occasionally doc dre-ziell
have to step in every once in a while to save me

to make me stop and think about it fore i just say things
sometimes i forget what other people just may think
a lot of rappers probably wouldnt know how to take me
if they heard some shit id lay the tape fore they erase me

i maybe a little too fast paced and racy
sometimes the average listener rewinds and plays me twenty times
cuz i say so many rhymes it may seem
like im goin too fast cuz my mind is racing

and i could give a fuck what category you place me
long as when im pushing up daisies and gone
as long as you place me amongst one of them greats
when i hit the heavenly gates ill be cool beside jay-z

for every single die hard fan who embraced me
im thankful for the talent in which god gave me
and im thankful for the environment that he placed me
believe it or not i thank my mom for how she raised me

in the neighborhood daily they jumped and chased me
it only made me what i am today see
regardless of what anybody believes who hates me
you aint gonna make or break me

tryna strip me of my credibility and make me look fake g
youre only gonna be in for a rude awakening
cuz sooner or later you haters are all gonna face me
and when you face me with all the shit youve been saving to say to me

you had all this time to think about it
now dont pussy out and try to wimp out face me
cuz ive been patiently waiting for the day
that we finally meet in the same place to see

what we have to do is deal with it when these individuals are young enough
if you will to be saved not in a religious sense 
but not to constitute what this country at times calls we throw away children
we seem to be approaching an age of the gross burp
we all have this idea that we should move up a little bit from our parents station
and each generation should do a little bit better

alright come on lets cut this bullshittin and dub
lets get it started lets start addressin this issue
and open it up
lets take this shit back to the basement
and we can discuss statements thats made on this tape
and this whole origin of

the music that we all know and love the music we all enjoy
the music that you accuse me of tryin to destroy
lets rewind it to 89 when i was boy on the east side of detroit
crossin 8 mile and a war and they hit territory

id like to share a story this is my story
and cant nobody tell it for me
i am well aware that i dont belong here
you made that perfectly clear

i get my ass kicked damn theyre everywhere
from bel air shoppin centre just for stoppin in there
from the black side all the way to the white side
okay theres a bright side
a day that i might slide

you may call it a pass i call it haulin my ass
through that patch of grass over them railroad tracks
oh them railroad tracks them old railroad tracks
them good old notorious so well known tracks

so lets go back
follow the yellow brick road
as we go on another episode
journey with me as i take you through this nifty little place
that i once used to call home sweet home

come on lets go back
follow the yellow brick road
as we go on another episode
journey with me as i take you through this nifty little place
that i once used to call home sweet home

i roam the streets so much they call me a drifter
sometimes i stick up a thumb just to hitchhike
just to get picked up theyd give me a lift up
8 mile and van dyke id steal a goddamn bike

from somebodys backyard
and drop it off at the park
that was the halfway mark
to meet kim had to walk back to her mommas and charmers
after dark to sneak me in the house
when im kicked out my moms

thats about the time i first met proof wed goof
hed carry on the steps said i was bored handin out some flyers
he was doin some talent shows at center line high
i told him to stop by and check this out some time

he looked at me like im out my mind
shook his head like white boys dont know how to rhyme
i spit out a line and rhymed birthday with first place
and they both had the same rhymes that soundalike

we was on that same shit that big daddy kane shit
where compound syllables sound combined
from that day we was down to ride
somehow we knew wed meet again somewhere down the line

so lets go back
follow the yellow brick road
as we go on another episode
journey with me as i take you through this nifty little place
that i once used to call home sweet home

come on lets go back

that i once used to call home sweet home

my first year in 9th grade 
cant forget that day in school 
it was cool til your man mc sham came through
and said that pumas the brand cause the klan makes troops

it was rumors but man goddamn they flew
musta been true because man we done banned they shoes
i had the new ones the cool j ice-lambs suede too
but we just threw em in the trash like they was yesterdays news
guess who came through next x-clan debuted


with a key sissies now with this being a new trend
we dont fit in crackers is out with cactus albums
blackness is in african symbols and medallions
represents black power and we aint know what it meant
me and my man howard and butter would go to the mall with em
all over our necks like were showing em off
not knowing at all we was being laughed at you aint even half black
you aint supposed to have that homie let me grab that
and that flavor flave clock we gonna have to snatch that
all i remember is meeting back at

manixs basement saying how we hate this how racist but dope the x clans tape is
which reminds me back in 89 me and kim broke up for the first time
she was tryna two time me

and there was this black girl
at our school who thought i was cool cause i rapped so she was kinda eyeing me
and oh the irony guess what her name was aint even gonna say it plus
the same color hair as hers was and blue contacts and a pair of jugs
the bombest goddamn girl in our whole school if i could pull it
not only would i become more popular but i would be able to piss kim off at the same time

but it backfired i was supposed to dump her
but she dumped me for this black guy
and thats the last i ever seen or heard or spoke to
the oh foolish pride girl
but ive heard people say they heard the tape and it aint that bad
but it was i singled out a whole race and for that apologize i was wrong
cause no matter what color a girl is shes still a hoe

so lets go back
follow the yellow brick road
as we go on another episode
journey with me as i take you through this nifty little place
that i once used to call home sweet home

come on lets go back
follow the yellow brick road
as we go on another episode
journey with me as i take you through this nifty little place
that i once used to call home sweet homestep by step heart to heart left right left 
we all fall down 

step by step heart to heart left right left 
we all fall down like toy soldiers 
bit by bit torn apart we never win 
but the battle wages on for toy soldiers

im supposed to be the soldier who never blows his composure 
even though i hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders 
i aint never supposed to show it my crew aint supposed to know it 
even if it means goin toe to toe with a benzino it dont matter

id never drag them in battles that i can handle unless i absolutely have to 
im supposed to set an example 
i need to be the leader my crew looks for me to guide em 
if some shit ever just pop off im supposed to be beside em

now the ja shit i tried to squash it it was too late to stop it 
theres a certain line you just dont cross and he crossed it 
i heard him say hailies name on a song and i just lost it 
it was crazy this shit be way beyond some jay-z and nas shit 

and even though the battle was won i feel like we lost it
i spent too much energy on it honestly im exhausted 
and im so caught in it i almost feel im the one who caused it 
this aint what im in hip-hop for its not why i got in it 

that was never my object for someone to get killed 
why would i wanna destroy something i helped build
it wasnt my intentions my intentions was good 
i went through my whole career without ever mentionin it

now its just out of respect for not runnin my mouth 
and talkin about something that i knew nothing about
plus dre told me stay out this just wasnt my beef 
so i did i just fell back watched and gritted my teeth 

while hes all over tv down talkin a man
who literally saved my life like fuck it i understand
this is business and this shit just isnt none of my business
but still knowin this shit could pop off at any minute cause 

step by step heart to heart left right left 
we all fall down like toy soldiers 
bit by bit torn apart we never win 
but the battle wages on for toy soldiers

there used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme 
and wouldnt have to worry about one of your people dyin 
but now its elevated cause once you put someones kids in it 
the shit gets escalated it aint just words no more is it

its a different ball game callin names and you aint just rappin 
we actually tried to stop the 50 and ja beef from happenin 
me and dre had sat with him kicked it and had a chat with him
and asked him not to start it he wasnt gonna go after him

until ja started yappin in magazines how we stabbed him
fuck it 50 smash em mash em and let him have it 
meanwhile my attention is pulled in another direction
some receptionist at the source who answers phones at his desk

has an erection for me and thinks that ill be his resurrection
tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record 
but now hes fucked the game up cause one of the ways i came up 
was through that publication the same one that made me famous

now the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothin 
well fuck it that mutherfucker can get it too fuck him then
when im so busy being pissed off i dont stop to think 
that we just inherited 50s beef with murder inc 

and hes inherited mine which is fine aint like either of us mind 
we still have soldiers thats on the front line
thats willing to die for us as soon as we give the orders
never to extort us strictly to show they support us

well maybe shout em out in a rap or up in a chorus 
to show them we love em back and let em know how important it is 
to have runyon avenue soldiers up in our corners
their loyalty to us is worth more than any award is

but i aint tryna have none of my people hurt or murdered 
it aint worth it i cant think of a perfecter way to word it 
than to just say that i love yall too much to see the verdict
ill walk away from it all before i let it go any further 

but dont get it twisted its not a plea that im coppin 
im just willin to be the bigger man if yall can quit poppin
off at your jaws with the knockin cause frankly im sick of talkin
im not gonna let someone elses coffin rest on my conscience cause

step by step heart to heart left right left 
we all fall down like toy soldiers 
bit by bit torn apart we never win 
but the battle wages on for toy soldiersi pledge allegiance to the flag of the united states of america
and to the republic for which it stands
one nation under god
indivisible with liberty and justice for all

it feels so good to be back

i scrutinize every word memorize every line
i spit it once refuel re-energize and rewind
i give sight to the blind my insight through the mind
i exercise my right to express when i feel its time

its just all in your mind what you interpret it as
i say to fight you take it as imma whip someones ass
if you dont understand dont even bother to ask
a father who has grown up with a fatherless past

who has blown up now to rap phenomenon that has
or at least shows no difficulty multi-task
and in juggling both perhaps mastered his craft
slash entrepreneur who has helped launch a few more rap acts

whos had a few obstacles thrown his way through the last half
of his career typical manure moving past that
mr kisses ass crack hes a class act
rubber band man yea he just snaps back

come along follow me as i lead through the darkness
as i provide just enough spark that we need to proceed
carry on give me hope give me strength
come with me and i wont steer you wrong

put your faith and your trust as i guide us through the fog
to the light at the end of the tunnel
we gonna fight we gonna charge we gonna stomp we gonna march
through the swamp we gonna mosh through the marsh
take us right through the doors cmon

all the people up top on the side and the middle
come together lets all bomb and swamp just a little
just let it gradually build from the front to the back
all you can see is a sea of people some white and some black

dont matter what color all that matters we gathered together
to celebrate for the same cause dont matter the weather
if it rains let it rain yeah the wetter the better
they aint gonna stop us they cant we stronger now more than ever

they tell us no we say yea they tell us stop we say go
rebel with a rebel yell raise hell we gonna let em know
stomp push shove mush fuck bush
until they bring our troops home cmon

come along follow me as i lead through the darkness
as i provide just enough spark that we need to proceed
carry on give me hope give me strength
come with me and i wont steer you wrong

put your faith and your trust as i guide us through the fog
to the light at the end of the tunnel
we gonna fight we gonna charge we gonna stomp we gonna march
through the swamp we gonna mosh through the marsh
take us right through the doors cmon

imagine it pouring its raining down on us
mosh pits outside the oval office
someones tryina tell us something
maybe this is god just sayin were responsible
for this monster this coward that we have empowered

this is bin laden look at his head noddin
how could we allow something like this without pumping our fists
now this is our final hour

let me be the voice in your strength and your choice
let me simplify the rhyme just to amplify the noise
try to amplify the times it and multiply by six-
teen million people are equal at this high pitch

maybe we can reach al queda through my speech
let the president answer a higher anarchy
strap him with an ak-47 let him go fight his own war
let him impress daddy that way

no more blood for oil we got our own battles to fight
on our own soil no more psychological warfare
to trick us to thinking that we aint loyal
if we dont serve our own country were patronizing a hero

look in his eyes its all lies
the stars and stripes theyve been swiped washed out and wiped
and replaced with his own face mosh now or die
if i get sniped tonight you know why cause i told you to fight

come along follow me as i lead through the darkness
as i provide just enough spark that we need to proceed
carry on give me hope give me strength
come with me and i wont steer you wrong

put your faith and your trust as i guide us through the fog
to the light at the end of the tunnel
we gonna fight we gonna charge we gonna stomp we gonna march
through the swamp we gonna mosh through the marsh
take us right through the doors cmon

and as we proceed to mosh
through this desert storm
in these closing statements if they should argue
let us beg to differ

as we set aside our differences
and assemble our own army
to disarm this weapon of mass destruction
that we call our president for the present

and mosh for the future of our next generation
to speak and be heard
mr president mr senator
do you guys hear us*puking noises*

thinking of you again

every time i think of you i puke
you must just not know-oh-oh-oh-ho
you may not think you do but you do
every time i think of you

i was gonna take the time to sit down and write you a little poem
but off of the dome would probably be a little more
more suitable for this type of song whoa
i got a million reasons off the top of my head that i could think of
sixteen bars this aint enough to put some ink ta
so fuck it imma start right here by just be briefer
bout to rattle off some other reasons

i knew i shouldnt go and get another tattoo of you
on my arm but what do i go and do

every time i think of you i puke
you must just not know whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
you may not think you do but you do
every time i think of you

i was gonna take the time to sit down and write you a little letter
but i thought a song would probably be a little better
instead of a letter
that youd probably just shred up yeah

i stumbled on your picture yesterday and it made me stop and think of
how much of a waste itd be for me to put some ink ta
a stupid piece a paper id rather let you see how
much i fuckin hate you in a freestyle

youre a fuckin cokein slut i hope you fuckin die
i hope you get to hell and satan sticks a needle in your eye
i hate your fuckin guts you fuckin slut i hope you die

gimme a callspoken
yeah
definitely definitely definitely dope
definitely definitely k-mart
yeah yeah


eminem &amp; dr dre 

you find me offensive i find you offensive for finding me offensive
hence if i should draw out a line any fences if so to what extents if
any should i go cause its gettin expensive
being on the other side of the court room on the defensive

they say i cause extensive psychological nerve damage to the brain
when i go to lengths this far at other peoples expenses
i say youre all just too goddamn sensitive
its censorship and its downright blasphemous

lets end this shit now cause i wont stand for this
and christopher reeves wont sit for this neither
and lets clear this up too i aint got no beef with him either
he used to be like a hero to me i even believe

i had one of those twenty-five cent stickers on my refrigerator
right next to darth vader and darth must have put a hex on him for later
i feel like its my fault cause of the way that
i stuck him off in between him and lex luther

i killed superman i killed super-man and how ironic
that id be the bad guy kryptonite the green chronic

cause i aint got no legs or no brain
nice to meet you hi my name is i forgot my name
my name was not to become what i became with this level of fame
my soul is possessed by this devil my new name is rain man

now in the bible it says thou shall not watch two lesbians in bed
have homosexual sex unless of course you were given the consent to join in
then of course its intercourse and its bisexual sex
which isnt as bad as long as you show some remorse for your actions

either before during or after performing the act of that which
is normally referred to as such more commonly known phrases
that are more used by today kids in a more derogatory way
but whos to say whats fair to say and what not to say lets ask dr dre

dr dre what up i got a question if i may yeah
is it gay to play putt putt golf with a friend yeah
and watch his butt butt when he tees off yeah
but but i aint done yet

in football a quarterback yells out hut hut while he reaches in another grown mans ass
grabs on his nuts but just what if it was never meant it was just an accident
but he tripped fell slipped and his penis went in his teeny-tiny little round hiney
and he didnt mean it but his little weenie flinched just a little bit

and i dont need to go into any more details but
what if he pictured it as a females butt
is that gay i just need to clear things up
till then ill just walk around with a manly strut because

cause i aint got no legs or no brain
nice to meet you hi my name is i forgot my name
my name was not to become what i became with this level of fame
my soul is possessed by this devil my new name is rain man

you find me offensive i find you offensive
shit this is the same verse i just did this
when am i gonna come to my good senses
probably the day bush comes to my defenses

my spider sense is tellin me spider-man is nearby
and my plan is to get him next and open up a whoop ass canister
goddammit dre wheres the goddamn beat yeah anyway

anyway i dont know how else to put it
this is the only thing that im good at
i am the bad guy kryptonite the green chronic
demonic yep yep dont worry im on it

i got it high-fived nick lachey
stuck a pin in jessicas head and walked away
and as she flew around the room like a balloon i
grabbed the last can of chicken tuna out the trash can and zoom i

headed straight back to the neverland ranch
with a peanut butter jelly chicken tuna sandwich
and i aint even gotta make no goddamn sense
i just did a whole song and i didnt say shit

cause i aint got no legs or no brain
nice to meet you hi my name is i forgot my name
my name was not to become what i became with this level of fame
my soul is possessed by this devil my new name is rain man

cause i-ahh ahh-ahh-ahh

spoken
yo rain man
definitely definitely dr dre super-dope beat maker two thousand and
two thousand four hundred and eighty seven million nine hundred and seventy three thousand four hundred and sixty three
and seventy yeahi dont understand
why are you being so mean
youre a mean mean man

youre just jealous of me
cause you you just cant do what i do
so instead of just admitting it
you walk around and say
all kinds of really mean things
about me cause youre a meanie a meanie

but its only cause youre just really jealous of me
cause im what you want to be
so you just look like an idiot
when you say these mean things
cause its too easy to see
youre really just a big weenie big weenie

alright listen i need you to focus
i need you to go dig deep in your mind this is important
we are going to perform an experiment of the sorts
im going to have to ask you to bear with me for a moment

now i need you to open your mind; your eyes close them
you are now about to be placed under my hypnosis
for the next four and a half minutes
we are going to explore into your mind
to find out why youre so fucking jealous

now why did they make yoo-hoo hippity ga-ga boo-boo
psych im kidding i just wanted to see if youre still listenin 
okay now i need your undivided attention
sir i have a question
why do i always sense this undeniable tension

from the moment that i enter into the room
it gets all quiet and whispers
whenever theres conversation why am i always mentioned
ive been dying to ask; its been itchin at me
is it just because

youre just jealous of me cause you you just cant do what i do
so instead of just admitting it
you walk around and say all kinds of really mean things
about me cause youre a meanie a meanie

but its only cause youre just really jealous of me
cause im what you want to be
so you just look like an idiot
when you say these mean things
cause its too easy to see
youre really just a big weenie big weenie

alright now i i just flubbed a line
i was going to say something extremely important
but i forgot who or what it was; i fucked up
psych im kidding again you idiot; no i didnt

thats just what you wanted to hear from me
is that i fucked up aint it
but i can bust one take without lookin at no paper

it doesnt take a bunch of takes
or me to stand here in this booth all day
for me to say the truth okay
youre droolin you have tooth decay

your mouth is open youre disgusting
what the fuck dyou eat for lunch
a bunch of sweets or something what
you munch a bunch of crunch n munch

your tooth is rotten to the gum
your breath stinks; wanna chew some gum
yes i do sir; what am i on
you sir are on truth serum

marshall im so jealous of you
please say you wont tell nobody
id be so embarrassed; im just absolutely terrified
that someones gonna find out why im saying
all these terrible evil and awful mean things
its my own insecurity

youre just jealous of me cause you you just cant do what i do
so instead of just admitting it
you walk around and say all kinds of really mean things
about me cause youre a meanie a meanie

but its only cause youre just really jealous of me
cause im what you want to be
so you just look like an idiot
when you say these mean things
cause its too easy to see
youre really just a big weenie big weenie

alright now we were going to conduct
that experiment that we were talking about earlier
just to see what a frog looks like when it takes two hits of ecstasy
cause thats exactly what your eyes look like; want to check to see

heres a mirror; notice the resemblance here
wait let me put these sunglasses on
now look in this mirror; how about now
what do you have in common
youre both green with envy and look like idiots with sunglasses on em

you look like i sound like singing about weenies
now take my weenie out of your mouth
this is between me and you; i know youre not happy
i know youd much rather see me lying in the corner of a room somewhere crying
curled up in a ball tweaked out of my mind dying
there is no denying that my weenie is much bigger than yours is
mine is like sticking a banana between two oranges
whyre you even doing this to yourself its pointless
why do we have to keep on going through this this is tortuous
my point is this
that if you say mean things your weenie will shrink
now i forgot what the chorus is youre just a

youre just jealous of me cause you you just cant do what i do
so instead of just admitting it
you walk around and say all kinds of really mean things
about me cause youre a meanie a meanie

but its only cause youre just really jealous of me
cause im what you want to be
so you just look like an idiot
when you say these mean things
cause its too easy to see
youre really just a big weenie big weenie

dr dre fuck is wrong with you
haeminem
if theres any bitches in this room then theres something i gotta say 
for all the fools who fell for the first girl who comes their way 
ive been down that road and now im back sittin on square one 
tryna pick myself up where i started from 

obie trice 
i never woulda thought that id see you outta control 
even though my penis was deep down in your hole 
you should know between us we was like mates to soul 
nothing could intervene us especially no hoes

you was more or so the chalant type i chose 
to more shows haunted you nights i suppose 
thats how it go with time spent emotion grows 
in the beginning friends we decided to roll

so whos responsible when you get excited explode 
and obies grinning then you invite that obies cold 
but bitches the gon talk niggas they gon hate 
we established this way before we became mates 

so whats required is that you chill with all that fire 
get your desire when i retire 
spend some time with me say that youll be mine

i never thought id find someone to be mine 
lord knows i was right cuz you just crossed the line 
spend some time with me say that youll be mine

eminem
i used to say i never met a girl like you before 
still aint got a fuckin clue as to who you truly are
almost went as far as introducing you to my daughters
till you went as far as goin and snoopin through my drawers

now i just feel stupid for the loop that you threw me for 
cant believe i almost flew the coop for some stupid whore 
you used to say all you wanted was for me to be yours 
all i ever wanted from you was a few booty calls

if you recall i used to treat you like a groupie broad 
when we fucked i refused to even take my jewelry off 
but it threw me off the first time i called and you blew me off 
it was a shock it struck me as odd but it turned me on

you started getting moody on me pretty soon wed argue 
and the ruder you got the more beautiful you got to me 
and who woulda even knew that who woulda even thought possibly 
cupid could shoot another one of them goddamn darts at me

its true that i got shot in the heart 
but when someone seems too good to be true they usually are 
but see when youre in it its too hard to see 
till you pull up and see some other dudes car parked and reach

up under the seat as your heart starts to beat 
before you make a decision thats life altering 
and just as you halt and you turn and you start to leave 
you hear them words echoing almost haunting that taunting ring

spend some time with me say that youll be mine
i never thought id find someone to be mine 
lord knows i was right cause you just crossed the line 
spend some time with me say that youll be mine

stat quo 
yeah right bitch spend some time on my dick

in most cases stats attitude is fuck-a-bitch 
my only motive is to get head and fuck a bitch 
but you was different thought we shared a covenant 
even held your hand in public

we sufferin because of this 
shorty on some whole notha other shit 
tryna play sick thinkin imma trick off rick 
ill admit i was caught in the mix down to commit 
feed you the best of me i shoulda fed you piss

we started off closer than close 
but who coulda predicted to know your triflin ways woulda stopped our growth 
and the final result back in that same boat 
i ask myself do i love these hoes no 

50 cent
em introduced us 50 this is tanya tanya this is 50 
then slid off and left her to kick it with me 
i complimented her i said you have very nice lips 
with my imagination i could see her suckin my dick

we played the phone game a week later shit changed fast
had her comin over in a cab to give me some ass
downtown manhattan on the balcony stare at the skyline
penthouse full of imported shit you know how i grind

she got to talkin talkin like an opportunist too
why talk when suckin my dick is the real career move
said shes an inspiring actress she do videos for practice
yeah yeah now how many times have i heard that shit

spend some time with me say that youll be mine
i never thought id find someone to be mine 
lord knows i was right cuz you just crossed the line 
spend some time with me say that youll be minespoken
yeah i know sometimes things may not always make sense to you right now
but hey what daddy always tell you
straighten up little soldier stiffen up that upper lip
what you crying about
you got me

hailie i know you miss your mom and i know you miss your dad
when im gone but im trying to give you the life that i never had
i can see youre sad even when you smile even when you laugh
i can see it in your eyes deep inside you want to cry

cause youre scared i aint there daddys with you in your prayers
no more crying wipe them tears daddys here no more nightmares
we gon pull together through it we gon do it
laney uncles crazy aint he yeah but he loves you girl and you better know it

were all we got in this world when it spins when it swirls
when it whirls when it twirls two little beautiful girls
lookin puzzled in a daze i know its confusin you
daddys always on the move mamas always on the news

i try to keep you sheltered from it but somehow it seems
the harder that i try to do that the more it backfires on me
all the things growing up his daddy that he had to see
daddy dont want you to see but you see just as much as he did

we did not plan it to be this way your mother and me
but things have gotten so bad between us i dont see us ever being together
ever again like we used to be when we was teenagers
but then of course everything always happens for a reason

i guess it was never meant to be 
but its just something we have no control over and thats what destiny is
but no more worries rest your head and go to sleep
maybe one day well wake up and this will all just be a dream

now hush little baby dont you cry
everythings gonna be alright
stiffen that upper lip up little lady i told ya
daddys here to hold ya through the night

i know mommys not here right now and we dont know why
we fear how we feel inside
it may seem a little crazy pretty baby
but i promise mamas gon be alright

its funny i remember back one year when daddy had no money
mommy wrapped the christmas presents up and stuck em under the tree 
and said some of em were from me cause daddy couldnt buy em
ill never forget that christmas i sat up the whole night crying

cause daddy felt like a bum see daddy had a job
but his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom
and at the time every house that we lived in either kept getting broke into and robbed
or shot up on the block and your mom

was saving money for you in a jar
tryna start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
almost had a thousand dollars till someone broke in and stole it
and i know it hurt so bad it broke your mamas heart
and it seemed like everything was just startin to fall apart

mom and dad was arguin a lot so mama moved back
on the chalmers in the flat one bedroom apartment
and dad moved back to the other side of 8 mile on novara
and thats when daddy went to california with his cd
and met dr dre and flew you and mama out to see me

but daddy had to work you and momma had to leave me
then you started seeing daddy on the tv 
and mama didnt like it and you and laney were to young to understand it
papa was a rollin stone momma developed a habit
and it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
im just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand

cause all i ever wanted to do was just make you proud
now im sittin in this empty house
just reminiscing lookin at your baby pictures it just trips me out
to see how much you both have grown its almost like youre sisters now

wow guess you pretty much are and daddys still here
laney im talkin to you too daddys still here
i like the sound of that yeah its got a ring to it dont it
shh mamas only gone for the moment

now hush little baby dont you cry
everythings gonna be alright
stiffen that upper lip up little lady i told ya
daddys here to hold ya through the night

i know mommys not here right now and we dont know why
we fear how we feel inside
it may seem a little crazy pretty baby
but i promise mamas gon be alright

and if you ask me too daddys gonna buy you a mockingbird
imma give you the world
imma buy a diamond ring for you imma sing for you
ill do anything for you to see you smile

and if that mockingbird dont sing and that ring dont shine
imma break that birdies neck
id go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya
and make him eat every karat dont fuck with dad ha hai tell myself that i was doin all right 
theres nothin left to do tonight 
but go crazy on you 
crazy on you 
let me go crazy crazy on you ohhh 

cant you see what you do to me baby
you make me crazy you make me act like a maniac
im like a lunatic you make me sick
youre truly the only one who can do this to me
you just make me get so crazy

i go schizo i get so insane i just go schizophrenic
one minute i wanna slit your throat the next i wanna sex
you make me crazy
the way we act like two maniacs in the sack
we fuck like two jack rabbits and maybe thats a bad habit

cause the next day we right back at it 
in the same exact pattern 
what the fuck is the matter with us 
we cant figure out if its lust
or if its love which that is attractin us to each other 
they say that every man grows up to marry his own mother 

which would explain why youre such a motherfuckin bitch
but i stay and still stick it out with you
even though i just hit you today

but you deserved it 
you hit me first and provoked me to choke you 
just cause i came home late last night 
crawled in bed and i woke you 
but if theres one thing about you that i admire 
its baby because you stay with me 
maybe cause youre as crazy as i am 
cause when i look at you 
i can see an angel in your eyes but if i look deeper inside 
i see a freakish little side
like a devil in disguise 
youre always full of surprises 
always pullin devices out your personal vibrators and dildos 
youve fucked yourself so much you barely feel those anymore 
youre only 24 but youre plenty more mature 
then those other little hos who just act like little girls 
like theyre in middle school still youre crazy sexy cool 
chillin you play your position you never step out of line 
even though i stay in your buisness 
youve always kept out of mine 
i wonder whats on your mind 
sometimes they say love is blind 
maybe thats why the first time i dotted your eye 
you aint see the sign 
or maybe you did maybe you like me in charge 
baby cause were crazy in love 

i go crazy on you 
crazy on you 
let me go crazy crazy on you ohhh 

you are the ink to my paper 
what my pen is to my my pad 
the moral the very fiber 
the whole substance to my rap 
you are my reason for being the meaning of my existance 
if it wasnt for you i would never be able to spit this 
as intense as i do and the irony 
is you rely on me as much 
as i rely on you to inspire me like you do 
you provide me the lighter fluid to fuel in my fire 
youre my entire supply of gas the match and igniter 

the only way that im able to stay so stable 
is youre the legs to my table 
if you were to break id fall on my face 
but im always gonna make you feel 
i dont need you as much as i really need you 
so you dont use it to your advantage 

but youre essential to me 
youre the air i breathe 
i believe if you ever leave me 
id probaly have no reason to be 
you are the kim to my marshall 
youre the slim to my shady 
the dre to my eminem 
the alaina to my hailie 

you are the word that im lookin for 
when im tryin to describe how i feel inside 
and the right one just wont come to my mind 
youre like the pillow that props me up 
the beam that supports me 
the bitch who never took half 
the wife who never divorced me 

youre like the root to my evil 
you let my devil come out me 
you let me beat the shit out you before you beat the shit out me 
and no matter how much too much is never enough 
baby cause were crazy in love 

i go crazy on you 
crazy on you 
let me go crazy crazy on you ohhhi told yall mother fuckers i was comin back

we gon have this motherfucker hoppin in a second bump bump 
thats why we always save the best cut last 
to make you scratch and itch for it like fresh cut grass

eminem
cause we done swam with the sharks wrestle with alligators 
spoke to a generation of angry teenagers 
whom if it wasnt for rap to bridge the gap 
maybe raised to be racist

who may have never got to see our faces 
grace the cover of rolling stone pages 
broke down barriers of language and races 
just call on the cape crusaders
and leave it to me and dre to pass the mic 
and we can play the back and forth all day 
like the hot potato game thats why we came to 

first we came here to set this party off right

we better check ourselves look at how shit has been
take a look where you live this is america and we are americans

i make bookoo bucks wear bookoo vests
drama hangin over my head like a voodoo hex
i couldve been next to fly over the cuckoos nest
but you know who with an s tattooed to my chest

but ive finessed it now i got the industry pissy
ever since me and dre split it 50/50 on 50 its funny
we got a buzz spreadin quicker than making paper airplanes out of a 20
fuck money i dont rap for dead presidents

id rather see the president dead its never been said but i said precedents
in the standards and they cant stand it
my name shouldve been bastard
the shit shouldve been plastered

on my forehead with a stamp
i shouldve been blasted
i shouldve been had a cap put in my ass
but im too swift and fast for that one bastard
im too old to go an cruise gratiot fuck that shit

i done seen how fast this rap shit
can turn into some pap-pap shit that quick snap click
but this time they got the fuckin au-to-ma-tic
aint no one gon test this mon clack click

take a look where you live this is america and we are americans

shh i got a secret if you can keep it between us
i tuck 2 ninas under my jeans either side of my penis
under my long johns under my sean johns
when runnin with the long arm or the long long gone

imma do five years no less than that o questions asked
so it might be a good idea that i stop right here
and quit while im ahead already in the red

take a look where you live this is america and we are americansthe more you put me through
the more it makes me wanna come back to you
you say you hate me i just love you more
you dont want me i just want you more

i buy you flowers you throw em at me
i know its sad but its making me happy
the more that you slap me the more that it turns me on
because you love me and i love you more

its sick but who could ever predict wed be doin the same shit
we say that we do it for our baby but we dont we do it for us
its lust cause neither one of us trusts each other so we fuck
till we bust till cuss each other out we know what its about
shout till i throw you out the house you throw me out the house
i throw you on the couch punch you in the mouth
we fist fight till we turn this mother out and apologize after laughter
pain its insane were back in the same chapter again
and its sad but its true when im laying here with you
there aint nothing anyone could ever say or ever do

cause the more you put me through
the more it makes me wanna come back to you
you say you hate me i just love you more
you dont want me i just want you more

i buy you flowers you throw em at me
i know its sad but its making me happy
the more that you slap me the more that it turns me on
because you love me and i love you more

cause i hate you do you hate me 
good cause youre so fuckin beautiful when youre angry
it makes me wanna just take you and just throw you
on the bed and fuck you like i dont even know you

you fuck other people and i fuck other people
youre a slut but im equal im a mutt were both evilin our ways 
but neither one of us would ever admit it
cause one of us would have one up on the other so forget it

we can make accusations people spread rumours
but they aint got proof till they do its just the two of us
you and me cause any chick can say that shes screwin me
but you gotta believe it to a degree cuz true indeed
if you didnt i wouldnt be hittin yeah i would 
cuz the sex is too damn good if i ran who would i run to
that would be this soft and warm so its off and on
usually more off then on but at least we know that we
share this common bond youre the only one i can fuck
without a condom on i hope the only reason that i cope
is cuz of that fact and i can bust in that and thats why

the more you put me through
the more it makes me wanna come back to you
you say you hate me i just love you more
you dont want me i just want you more
i buy you flowers you throw em at me
i know its sad but its making me happy
the more that you slap me the more that it turns me on
because you love me and i love you more


i can never understand it thats why i dont try
from junior high until we both die you silly hoe why must we try
is it really so rough that we must always call each others billy goats gruff

try to pull each others legs until the other begs
were lying to ourself thats the beauty of it yeah
cause we truly love each other thats why we always fight
and all we do is shove each other every other fuckin night

and its clear it aint gonna change this pinned up rage
we both have we both feel like weve been upstaged
by someone else we both been someone elses someone else
the problem is neither one wants help

its an addiction
and it cant be fixed our familys mixed up
theres a baby sister in the mix and it hurts
cause the pieces to the puzzle dont fit
and anybody who thinks he knows us doesnt know shit

and theyre probably just tired of hearing it all the time on every song
every lyric and every rhyme all the hoopla all of the woopty woo
what you put me through fuckin woopty do

but i wont be made a fool of if this is true love
you wouldnt do what you did last time you wouldnt screw up
this time cause this time girl im tellin you what
you do it again and im fuckin you up 

no matter what you say what you do
ima hunt you down till i find you
no matter where you run ill be right there
right behind you in your nightmares

so much for them flowers and the candy
all the times that you threw it back at me
told me you hate me you gon hate me more
when you find out you cant escape me whore

the more you put me through
the more it makes me wanna come back to you
you say you hate me i just love you more
you dont want me i just want you more
i buy you flowers you throw em at me
i know its sad but its making me happy
the more that you slap me the more that it turns me on
because you love me and i love you moreonce you call my name out things will never be the same
they should have never let us get off foot in this game

ever since i was introduced to rap music
i been missin a screw like bishop and juice
i could lose it at any moment
those who know me know it
so they probaly told you go with the flow
just so that i dont explode
and have another episode where i let it go as far as
the one with benzino did

im waitin for that next beef
im cocked locked and loaded
im ready to go so bad im goin bananas
my dicks so hard anna nicole could use it
to fuckin pole vault with
oh shit i mean when she was still bloated 
before they cut her stomach open and lipoed it

anybody i throw flames at gets a name its a game
cause they know that they dont spit the same
its a shame what people do for 10 minutes of fame
everyday its the same thing
people in this game try to buddy buddy us
just to get close enough to study us
everybody just wants to have somethin to do with that
they all tryin to get that stamp
they after that shady/aftermath money

its like a monopoly
they probaly just now finally understand how to rob fully
50 cent was like a fuckin jackpot for me 
and dre its like we hit the fuckin lottery

and a damn slot machine at the same time as each other
why the fuck you think we rhyme like we brothers
when we rhyme with each other 
in time we discovered that we had more in common 
then we thought with each other

both robbed of our mothers
our fathers aint want us
what was wrong with us was it our fault
cause we started thinkin god doesnt love us
two hard motheruckers who just happened to meet at the right time
what a coincidence cause when 50 got shot up in jamaica queens
i still remember the call up in chunking cause

big l had just got popped just a month before
if 50 lives hes gettin dropped from columbia
two years later me and doc had to come and operate
thats when he popped up a number one
and we aint never gonna stop if you wonderin
even if im under the gun 

you aint gotta agree all the time with me
or see eye to eye therell always be animosity between you and i
but see the difference is if it is i could give a shit 
still gonna conduct motherfuckin buisness as usual

egos aside fore i bruise em all 
swallow your pride fore i step on it with shoes you call nikes
earth links how do you like these you gotta love them
look at the bottom of em theyre like cleats
stompin i been rompin since tim dogg was hollerin
fuck compton

i was whilin freestylin
back when they was still makin maxell cassettes
i wasnt even raps elvis yet 
that tells us that any doubts in your head that seals the shit

ricky-ticky-toc-ticky-ticky-toc
still with the diggy-diggy-doc-diggy-diggy-doc
and you dont stoproyce da 59
yo yo its several different levels to pickin up shovels
and dumpin you in ditches under sea-level front and you can witness
let me refreshen you niggas; tell you my position in this
beef — leave you under venice opposition finished
here it is we invaded created a pyramid
of a haven of names so blame dre and that ear o his

and i never heat you for respect unless you greet me wit less
i got a skunk in my trunk

eminem
since im in a position to talk to these kids and they listen
i aint no politician but ill kick it wit em a minute
cause see they call me a menace; and if the shoe fits ill wear it
but if it dont then yall ll swallow the truth grin and bear it
now whos the king of these rude ludicrous lucrative lyrics
who could inherit the title put the youth in hysterics
usin his music to steer it sharin his views and his merits
but theres a huge interference — theyre sayin you shouldnt hear it
maybe its hatred i spew maybe its food for the spirit
maybe its beautiful music i made for you to just cherish
but im debated disputed hated and viewed in america
as a motherfuckin drug addict — like you didnt experiment
n—now thats when you start to stare at whos in the mirror
and see yourself as a kid again and you get embarrased
and i got nothin to do but make you look stupid as parents
you fuckin do-gooders too bad you couldnt do good at marriage ha ha
and do you have any clue what i had to do to get here i dont
think you do so stay tuned and keep your ears glued to the stereo
cause here we go hes royce hes the king of detroit

click-clock six shots blows through another door
and it gets hot hip-hop quotable tug o war yeah

hes crazy deranged not media eaters we renegades

eminem
see im a poet to some — a regular modern day shakespeare
jesus christ the king of these latter day saints here
to shatter the picture in which of that as they paint me
as a monger of hate satanist scatter-brained athiest
but that aint the case see its a matter of taste
we as a people decide if shadys as bad as they say he is
or is he the latter — a gateway to escape
media scapegoat who they can be mad at today
see its easy as cake simple as whistlin dixie
while im wavin the pistol at sixty christians against me
go to war with the mormons take a bath with the catholics
in holy water — no wonder they try to hold me under longer
im a motherfuckin spiteful delightful eyeful

dre just let it run
hey yo turn the beat up a little bit
hey yo this song is for anyone fuck it just shut up and listen
hey yo

i sit back with this pack of zig zags and this bag
of this weed it gives me the shit needed to be
the most meanest mc on this on this earth
and since birth ive been cursed with this curse to just curse

and just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
and it sells and it helps in itself to relieve
all this tension dispensin these sentences gettin this stress
thats been eatin me recently off of this chest

and i rest again peacefully peacefully
but at least have the decency in you
to leave me alone when you freaks see me out
in the streets when im eatin or feedin my daughter

to not come and speak to me speak to me
i dont know you and no i dont owe you a mo-therfuck-ing thing
im not mr *nsync im not what your friends think
im not mr friendly i can be a prick

if you tempt me my tank is on empty is on empty
no patience is in me and if you offend me
im liftin you 10 feet 10 feet in the air
i dont care who was there and who saw me destroy you

go call you a lawyer file you a lawsuit
ill smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
im tired of arguin of arguin
i dont mean to be mean but thats all i can be its just me

and i am whatever you say i am
if i wasnt then why would i say i am
in the paper the news every day i am
radio wont even play my jam

cause i am whatever you say i am
if i wasnt then why would i say i am
in the paper the news every day i am
i dont know its just the way i am

sometimes i just feel like my father i hate to be bothered
with all of this nonsense its constant
and oh its his lyrical content
that song guilty conscience has gotten such rotten responses

and all of this controversy circles me
and it seems like the media immediately
points a finger at me finger at me
so i point one back at em but not the index or pinky

or the ring or the thumb its the one you put up
when you dont give a fuck when you wont just put up
with the bullshit they pull cause they full of shit too
when a dudes gettin bullied and shoots up his school

and they blame it on marilyn on marilyn and the heroin
where were the parents at and look where its at
middle america now its a tragedy
now its so sad to see an upper class city

havin this happenin this happenin
then attack eminem cause i rap this way rap this way
but im glad cause they feed me the fuel that i need for the fire
to burn and its burnin and i have returned

and i am whatever you say i am
if i wasnt then why would i say i am
in the paper the news every day i am
radio wont even play my jam

cause i am whatever you say i am
if i wasnt then why would i say i am
in the paper the news every day i am
i dont know its just the way i am

im so sick and tired of bein admired
that i wish that i would just die or get fired
and dropped from my label lets stop with the fables
im not gonna be able to top on my name is

and pigeonholed into some poppy sensation
that copped me rotation at rock n roll stations
and i just do not got the patience got the patience
to deal with these cocky caucasians

who think im some wigger who just tries to be black
cause i talk with an accent and grab on my balls
so they always keep askin the same fuckin questions fuckin questions
what school did i go to what hood i grew up in

the why the who what when the where and the how
till im grabbin my hair and im tearin it out ahhh
cause they drivin me crazy me crazy
i cant take it im racin im pacin i stand and i sit

and im thankful for every fan that i get
but i cant take a shit in the bathroom without someone standin by it
no i wont sign your autograph
you can call me an asshole im glad

cause i am whatever you say i am
if i wasnt then why would i say i am
in the paper the news every day i am
radio wont even play my jam

cause i am whatever you say i am
if i wasnt then why would i say i am
in the paper the news every day i am
i dont know its just the way i ami got a riddle
whats little and talks big
with midget arms and creamy white filling in the middle
thatll do anything to throw dirt on my name
if it means walking the whole mediterranean
is it an albanian armenian iranian tasmanian
no his names raymond and oh
oh sorry yo so sorry whoa
but that was a long time ago
when i was just joe schmo
rapping in joe blows basement
i apologized for it before so 
either accept it or you dont
and lets move on
if i aint shown that ive grown you get the bone*
keep lickin these nuts you industry mutts
keep walking around sniffing each others butts
or should i say asses
what would be the more politically correct term to use for the masses
the question i ask is how can i explain this
how can i swing this in english language
if i switched to slang and turned man to mane
do i do it in vain or simply to entertain
am i being real or am i being fake
am i just a fraud or am i truly genuine
or am i caught up in this hot water
word on my daughter
i told you that i love this culture
dont let em insult ya
ima tell you once more again
this is the environment i was brought up in
but every now and then
i use my pen to get rid of some frustration
or should i say âshunâ
is it just another one of my subliminal ways of racism*
your face is numb youre stunned
your look is cold like that of a man of 70 some years old*
and it only gets colder
which is why i understand
you cant be mad at a 44 year old fan with a chip on his shoulder
who only owns a half of a magazine
and the only way to have it seen is to put me on the front of it again
only thing that makes him grin is to see me frown*
papa cant stand me
papa needs to take his medication and sit the f**k down
in his new chair that goes round and round
that he bought from the money in his bank account
that i get him every issue when the thing comes out
sit back and let his puffy clown hair come out
and let his black side arm wrestle his white side
yell apartheid loud enough that he might slide
he might find someone dumb enough who might ride*
but aint nobody over here buying two white guys
disguised as pro-black
there is no slack for a harvard college grat in a fitted hat
and a hunchback standin by the clearance coat rack
in some old slacks and some rso throwbacks yeah*
shady in the place to bc
and it takes what i got to rock the mike right*
still not gonna cater these punks 
f**kin cock-suckin pussy-lips hated dicks cunts*<del>[intro]

i sit back with this pack of zig zags and this bag
of this weed it gives me the shit needed to be
the most meanest mc on this on this earth
and since birth ive been cursed with this curse to just curse

and just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
and it sells and it helps in itself to relieve
all this tension dispensin these sentences gettin this stress
thats been eatin me recently off of this chest

and i rest again peacefully peacefully
but at least have the decency in you
to leave me alone when you freaks see me out
in the streets when im eatin or feedin my daughter

to not come and speak to me speak to me
i dont know you and no i dont owe you a mo-therfuck-ing thing
im not mr *nsync im not what your friends think
im not mr friendly i can be a prick

if you tempt me my tank is on empty is on empty
no patience is in me and if you offend me
im liftin you 10 feet 10 feet in the air
i dont care who was there and who saw me destroy you

go call you a lawyer file you a lawsuit
ill smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
im tired of arguin of arguin
i dont mean to be mean but thats all i can be its just me

and i am whatever you say i am
if i wasnt then why would i say i am
in the paper the news every day i am
radio wont even play my jam

cause i am whatever you say i am
if i wasnt then why would i say i am
in the paper the news every day i am
i dont know its just the way i am

sometimes i just feel like my father i hate to be bothered
with all of this nonsense its constant
and oh its his lyrical content
that song guilty conscience has gotten such rotten responses

and all of this controversy circles me
and it seems like the media immediately
points a finger at me finger at me
so i point one back at em but not the index or pinky

or the ring or the thumb its the one you put up
when you dont give a fuck when you wont just put up
with the bullshit they pull cause they full of shit too
when a dudes gettin bullied and shoots up his school

and they blame it on marilyn on marilyn and the heroin
where were the parents at and look where its at
middle america now its a tragedy
now its so sad to see an upper class city

havin this happenin this happenin
then attack eminem cause i rap this way rap this way
but im glad cause they feed me the fuel that i need for the fire
to burn and its burnin and i have returned

and i am whatever you say i am
if i wasnt then why would i say i am
in the paper the news every day i am
radio wont even play my jam

cause i am whatever you say i am
if i wasnt then why would i say i am
in the paper the news every day i am
i dont know its just the way i am

im so sick and tired of bein admired
that i wish that i would just die or get fired
and dropped from my label lets stop with the fables
im not gonna be able to top on my name is

and pigeonholed into some poppy sensation
that copped me rotation at rock n roll stations
and i just do not got the patience got the patience
to deal with these cocky caucasians

who think im some wigger who just tries to be black
cause i talk with an accent and grab on my balls
so they always keep askin the same fuckin questions fuckin questions
what school did i go to what hood i grew up in

the why the who what when the where and the how
till im grabbin my hair and im tearin it out ahhh
cause they drivin me crazy me crazy

extra-terrestrial running over pedestrians

to seize everything you ever wanted in one moment
would you capture it or just let it slip

yo his palms are sweaty knees weak arms are heavy
theres vomit on his sweater already moms spaghetti
hes nervous but on the surface he looks calm and ready
to drop bombs but he keeps on forgetting

what he wrote down the whole crowd goes so loud
he opens his mouth but the words wont come out
hes chokin how everybodys jokin now
the clocks runs out times up over blow

snap back to reality oh there goes gravity oh
there goes rabbit he choked hes so mad but he wont
give up that easy no he wont have it he knows
his whole backs to these ropes it dont matter hes dope
 
he knows that but hes broke hes so stagnant he knows
when he goes back to his mobile home thats when its
back to the lab again yo this whole rhapsody
he better go capture this moment and hope it dont pass him

you better lose yourself in the music the moment
you own it you better never let it go
you only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow
this opportunity comes once in a lifetime

you better lose yourself in the music the moment
you own it you better never let it go
you only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow
this opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better

his souls escaping through this hole that is gaping
this world is mine for the taking make me king
as we move toward a new world order
a normal life is boring but super-stardoms

close to postmortem it only grows harder
only grows hotter he blows us all over
these hoes is all on him coast to coast shows
hes known as the globetrotter lonely roads god only knows

hes grown farther from home hes no father
he goes home and barely knows his own daughter
but hold your nose cause here goes the cold water
these hoes dont want him no mo hes cold product

they moved on to the next schmoe who flows
he nose dove and sold nada so the soap opera
is told and unfolds i suppose its old partna
but the beat goes on da da dum da dum da da da dum

you better lose yourself in the music the moment 
you own it you better never let it go 
you only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow 
this opportunity comes once in a lifetime 

you better lose yourself in the music the moment 
you own it you better never let it go
you only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow 
this opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better

no more games imma change what you call rage
tear this motherfuckin roof off like two dogs caged
i was playin in the beginning the mood all changed
i been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage

but i kept rhymin and stepped right in the next cipher
best believe somebodys payin the pied piper
all the pain inside amplified by the
fact that i cant get by with my nine to five

and i cant provide the right type of
life for my family cause man these goddamn
food stamps dont buy diapers
and theres no movie theres no mekhi phifer this is my life

and these times are so hard and its getting even harder
tryin to feed and water my seed plus teeter-totter
caught up between bein a father and a prima donna
baby mama drama screamin on and too much for me to wanna

stay in one spot another day of monotony
has gotten me to the point im like a snail ive got
to formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
success is my only motherfuckin option failures not

mom i love you but this trailers got to go
i cannot grow old in salems lot
so here i go its my shot feet fail me not
this may be the only opportunity that i got

you better lose yourself in the music the moment
you own it you better never let it go
you only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow
this opportunity comes once in a lifetime

you better lose yourself in the music the moment
you own it you better never let it go
you only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow
this opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better

come on i ain’t leavin’ without you bitch come on with me
and my boy and this boy and this boy and his girl nate doggthese ideas are nightmares to white parents
whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings
like whatever they say has no bearing
its so scary in a house that allows no swearing

to see him walking around with his headphones blaring
alone in his own zone cold and he dont care
hes a problem child and what bothers him all comes out
when he talks about his fuckin dad walkin out

cause he hates him so bad that he blocks him out
but if he ever saw him again hed probably knock him out
his thoughts are whacked hes mad so hes talkin back
talkin black brainwashed from rock and rap

he sags his pants do-rags and a stocking cap
his stepfather hit him so he socked him back
and broke his nose his house is a broken home
theres no control he just lets his emotions go

chorus from aerosmiths dream on
come on sing with me sing for the year sing it
for the laughter sing for the tear come on
sing it with me if its just for today
maybe tomorrow the good lord will take you away

entertainment is changin intertwinin with gangstas
in the land of the killers a sinners mind is a sanctum
holy or unholy only have one homie
only this gun lonely cause dont anyone know me

yet everybody just feels like they can relate
i guess words are a motherfucker they can be great
or they can degrade or even worse they can teach hate
its like these kids hang on every single statement we make

like they worship us plus all the stores ship us platinum
now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen
from standin on corners and porches just rappin
to havin a fortune no more kissin ass

but then these critics crucify you journalists try to burn you
fans turn on you attorneys all want a turn at you
to get they hands on every dime you have
they want you to lose your mind every time you mad

so they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon
any dispute wont hesitate to produce handguns
thats why these prosecutors wanna convict me
strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly

but all they kids be listenin to me religiously
so im signin cds while police fingerprint me
theyre for the judges daughter but his grudge is against me
if im such a fuckin menace this shit doesnt make sense b

its all political if my music is literal
and im a criminal how the fuck can i raise a little girl
i couldnt i wouldnt be fit to
youre full of shit too guerrera that was a fist that hit you

come on sing with me sing for the year sing that shit
for the laughter sing for the tears sing with me
sing it with me if its just for today
maybe tomorrow the good lord will take you away

they say music can alter moods and talk to you
well can it load a gun up for you and cock it too
well if it can then the next time you assault a dude
just tell the judge it was my fault and ill get sued

see what these kids do is hear about us totin pistols
and they want to get one cause they think the shits cool
not knowin we really just protectin ourselves we entertainers
of course the shits affectin our sales you ignoramus

but music is reflection of self we just explain it
and then we get our checks in the mail its fucked up aint it
how we can come from practically nothing
to being able to have any fuckin thing that we wanted

thats why we sing for these kids who dont have a thing
except for a dream and a fuckin rap magazine
who post pin-up pictures on their walls all day long
idolize they favorite rappers and know all they songs

or for anyone whos ever been through shit in they lives
till they sit and they cry at night wishin theyd die
till they throw on a rap record and they sit and they vibe
were nothin to you but were the fuckin shit in they eyes

thats why we seize the moment try to freeze it and own it
squeeze it and hold it cause we consider these minutes golden
and maybe theyll admit it when were gone just let our spirits live on
through our lyrics that you hear in our songs and we can

sing with me sing for the year sing it
for the laughter sing for the tears come on
sing it with me if its just for today
maybe tomorrow the good lord will take you away

sing with me sing for the year sing it
for the laughter sing for the tears come on
sing it with me if its just for today
maybe tomorrow the good lord will take you awayobie trice
obie trice - real name no gimmicks

kidsstep by step heart to heart left right left 
we all fall down 

step by step heart to heart left right left 
we all fall down like toy soldiers 
bit by bit torn apart we never win 
but the battle wages on for toy soldiers

im supposed to be the soldier who never blows his composure 
even though i hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders 
i aint never supposed to show it my crew aint supposed to know it 
even if it means goin toe to toe with a benzino it dont matter

id never drag them in battles that i can handle unless i absolutely have to 
im supposed to set an example 
i need to be the leader my crew looks for me to guide em 
if some shit ever just pop off im supposed to be beside em

now the ja shit i tried to squash it it was too late to stop it 
theres a certain line you just dont cross and he crossed it 
i heard him say hailies name on a song and i just lost it 
it was crazy this shit be way beyond some jay-z and nas shit 

and even though the battle was won i feel like we lost it
i spent too much energy on it honestly im exhausted 
and im so caught in it i almost feel im the one who caused it 
this aint what im in hip-hop for its not why i got in it 

that was never my object for someone to get killed 
why would i wanna destroy something i helped build
it wasnt my intentions my intentions was good 
i went through my whole career without ever mentionin it

now its just out of respect for not runnin my mouth 
and talkin about something that i knew nothing about
plus dre told me stay out this just wasnt my beef 
so i did i just fell back watched and gritted my teeth 

while hes all over tv down talkin a man
who literally saved my life like fuck it i understand
this is business and this shit just isnt none of my business
but still knowin this shit could pop off at any minute cause 

step by step heart to heart left right left 
we all fall down like toy soldiers 
bit by bit torn apart we never win 
but the battle wages on for toy soldiers

there used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme 
and wouldnt have to worry about one of your people dyin 
but now its elevated cause once you put someones kids in it 
the shit gets escalated it aint just words no more is it

its a different ball game callin names and you aint just rappin 
we actually tried to stop the 50 and ja beef from happenin 
me and dre had sat with him kicked it and had a chat with him
and asked him not to start it he wasnt gonna go after him

until ja started yappin in magazines how we stabbed him
fuck it 50 smash em mash em and let him have it 
meanwhile my attention is pulled in another direction
some receptionist at the source who answers phones at his desk

has an erection for me and thinks that ill be his resurrection
tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record 
but now hes fucked the game up cause one of the ways i came up 
was through that publication the same one that made me famous

now the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothin 
well fuck it that mutherfucker can get it too fuck him then
when im so busy being pissed off i dont stop to think 
that we just inherited 50s beef with murder inc 

and hes inherited mine which is fine aint like either of us mind 
we still have soldiers thats on the front line
thats willing to die for us as soon as we give the orders
never to extort us strictly to show they support us

well maybe shout em out in a rap or up in a chorus 
to show them we love em back and let em know how important it is 
to have runyon avenue soldiers up in our corners
their loyalty to us is worth more than any award is

but i aint tryna have none of my people hurt or murdered 
it aint worth it i cant think of a perfecter way to word it 
than to just say that i love yall too much to see the verdict
ill walk away from it all before i let it go any further 

but dont get it twisted its not a plea that im coppin 
im just willin to be the bigger man if yall can quit poppin
off at your jaws with the knockin cause frankly im sick of talkin
im not gonna let someone elses coffin rest on my conscience cause

step by step heart to heart left right left 
we all fall down like toy soldiers 
bit by bit torn apart we never win 
but the battle wages on for toy soldiersspoken

sometimes i wanna get on tv and just let loose but cant
but its cool for tom green to hump a dead moose

my bum is on your lips my bum is on your lips
and if im lucky you might just give it a little kiss
and thats the message that we deliver to little kids
and expect them not to know what a womans clitoris is

of course theyre gonna know what intercourse is
by the time they hit 4th grade they got the discovery channel dont they
we aint nothing but mammals well some of us are cannibals
who cut other people open like cantaloupes

but if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
then theres no reason that a man and another man cant elope eww
but if you feel like i feel i got the antidote
women wave your pantyhose sing the chorus and it goes

and i dont gotta be false or sugar-coat it at all

daddys always on the move mamas always on the news

i try to keep you sheltered from it but somehow it seems
the harder that i try to do that the more it backfires on me
all the things growing up his daddy that he had to see
daddy dont want you to see but you see just as much as he did

we did not plan it to be this way your mother and me
but things have gotten so bad between us i dont see us ever being together
ever again like we used to be when we was teenagers
but then of course everything always happens for a reason

i guess it was never meant to be 
but its just something we have no control over and thats what destiny is
but no more worries rest your head and go to sleep
maybe one day well wake up and this will all just be a dream

its funny i remember back one year when daddy had no money
mommy wrapped the christmas presents up and stuck em under the tree 
and said some of em were from me cause daddy couldnt buy em
ill never forget that christmas i sat up the whole night crying

cause daddy felt like a bum see daddy had a job
but his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom
and at the time every house that we lived in either kept getting broke into and robbed
or shot up on the block and your mom

was saving money for you in a jar
tryna start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
almost had a thousand dollars till someone broke in and stole it
and i know it hurt so bad it broke your mamas heart
and it seemed like everything was just startin to fall apart

mom and dad was arguin a lot so mama moved back
on the chalmers in the flat one bedroom apartment
and dad moved back to the other side of 8 mile on novara
and thats when daddy went to california with his cd
and met dr dre and flew you and mama out to see me

but daddy had to work you and momma had to leave me
then you started seeing daddy on the tv 
and mama didnt like it and you and laney were to young to understand it
papa was a rollin stone momma developed a habit
and it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
im just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand

cause all i ever wanted to do was just make you proud
now im sittin in this empty house
just reminiscing lookin at your baby pictures it just trips me out
to see how much you both have grown its almost like youre sisters now

wow guess you pretty much are and daddys still here
laney im talkin to you too daddys still here
i like the sound of that yeah its got a ring to it dont it
shh mamas only gone for the moment

now hush little baby dont you cry

stiffen that upper lip up little lady i told ya
daddys here to hold ya through the night

i know mommys not here right now and we dont know why
we fear how we feel inside

have you ever loved someone so much youd give an arm for
not the expression no literally give an arm for
when they know theyre your heart
and you know you were their armor

and you will destroy anyone who would try to harm em
but what happens when karma turns right around and bites you
and everything you stand for turns on you to spite you
what happens when you become the main source of a pain

i aint mad - i just think its messed up you dont answer fans 
if you didnt wanna talk to me outside your concert 
you didnt have to but you coulda signed an autograph for matthew 
thats my little brother man hes only six years old 
we waited in the blistering cold for you 
for four hours and you just said no 
thats pretty crummy man - youre like his favorite idol 
he wants to be just like you man he likes you more than i do 
i aint that mad though i just dont like bein lied to 
remember when we met in denver - you said if id write you 
you would write back - see im just like you in a way 
i never knew my father neither; 
he used to always cheat on my mom and beat her 
i can relate to what youre sayin in your songs 
so when i have a crummy day i drift away and put em on 
cause i dont really got shit else so that shit and helps when im depressed 
i even got a tattoo of your name across the chest 
sometimes i even cut myself to see how much it bleeds 
its like adrenaline the pain is such a sudden rush for me 
see everything you say is real and i respect you cause you tell it 
my girlfriends jealous cause i talk about you 24/7

and heres an autograph for your brother i wrote it on a starter cap

you got some issues stan i think you need some counselin 
to help your ass from bouncin off the walls when you get down some 
and whats this junk about us meant to be together

i really think you and your girlfriend need each other 
or maybe you just need to treat her better

before you hurt yourself i think that youll be doin just fine 
if you relax a little im glad i inspire you but stan 
why are you so mad try to understand that i do want you as a fan 
i just dont want you to do some crazy bit 
i seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick 
some dude was drunk and drove this car over a bridge 
and had his girlfriend in the trunk and she was pregnant with his kid 
and in the car they found a tape but they didnt say who it was to

i get too blunted off of funny home grown
cause when i smoke out i hit the trees harder than sonny bono oh no
so if i said i never did drugs
that would mean i lie and get fucked more that the president does
hillary clinton tried to slap me and call me a pervert
i ripped her fucking tonsils out and fed her sherbet bitch
my nerves hurt and lately im on edge
grabbed vanilla ice and ripped out his blonde dreads cmere motherfucker
every girl i ever went out with is goin les
follow me and do exactly what the song says
smoke weed take pills drop outta school kill people and drink
jump behind the wheel like it was still legal
im dumb enough to walk in a store and steal
so im dumb enough to ask a for date with lauryn hill
some people only see that im white ignoring skill
cause i stand out like a green hat with an orange bill
but i dont get pissed yall dont even see through the mist
how the fuck can i be white i dont even exist
i get a clean shave bathe go to a rave
die from an overdose and dig myself up out of my grave
my middle finger wont go down how do i wave
and this is how im supposed to teach kids how to behave

now follow me and do exactly what you see
dont you wanna grow up to be just like me
i slap women and eat shrooms then od
now dont you wanna grow up to be just like me

me and marcus allen went over to see nicole
when we heard a knock on the door knock mustve been ron gold

my mind wont work
if my spine dont jerk
i slapped garth brooks out of his rhinestone shirt
im not a player just an ill rhyme-sayer
thatll spray an aerosol can up at the ozone layer *psssssssh*
my rap styles warped
im runnin out the morgue
with your dead grandmothers corpse to throw it on your porch *scream*
jumped in a chickenhawk cartoon with a cape on
and beat up foghorn leghorn
with an acorn

with deformative traits
a premature birth that was four minutes late
mother are you there i love you
i never meant to hit you over the head with that shovel *evil laugh*

out the corner of his cornea
he just saw you run
all you want is to rest
cause you cant run anymore youre done
all he wants is to kill you in front of an audience
while everybody is watching in the party applauding it

here i sit while im caught up in deep thought again
contemplating my next plot again
swallowing a klonopin while im noddin
in and out on the ottoman at the ramada inn
holding onto the pill bottle then

lick my finger and swirl it round the bottom
and make sure i got all of it
wake up naked at mcdonalds with
blood all over me dead bodies behind the counter shit
guess i must have just blacked out again
not again

its 3 am in the mornin
put my key in the door an
bodies laying all over the floor an
i dont remember how they got there but i guess i must have killed em
killed em

i said its 3 am in the mornin
put my key in the door an
bodies laying all over the floor an
i dont remember how they got there but i guess i must have killed em
killed em

sitting nude in my living room its almost noon
i wonder whats on the tube
maybe theyll show some boobs
surfing every channel
until i find hannah montana
then i reach for the aloe and lanolin

bust all over the wall panel and dismantling
every candle on top of the fireplace mantle and
grab my flannel and my bandanna then
kiss the naked mannequin man again
you can see him standing in my front window if you look in

im just a hooligan
whos used to using hallucinogens
causing illusions again
brain contusions again
cutting and bruising the skin
razors scissors and pins
jesus when does it end

phases that i go through
dazed and im so confused
days that i dont know who
gave these molecules to
me what am i gon do
hey the prodigal son
the diabolical one
very methodical when i slaughter dem

its 3 am in the mornin
put my key in the door an
bodies laying all over the floor an
i dont remember how they got there but i guess i must have killed em
killed em

i said its 3 am in the mornin
put my key in the door an
bodies laying all over the floor an
i dont remember how they got there but i guess i must have killed em

she puts the lotion in the bucket
it puts the lotion on the skin
or else it gets the hose again
she puts the lotion in the bucket
it puts the lotion on the skin
or else it gets the hose again

i duck and i slash slice and gash
last night was a blast
i cant quite remember when i had that
much fun off a half pint of the jack
my last vic and a half
a flashlight up kim kardashians ass

i remember the first time i dismembered a family member
december i think it was i was having drinks with my cousin
i wrapped him in christmas lights
pushed him into the stinking tub
cut him up into pieces then just when i went to drink his blood
i thought i aught to drink his bath water that aught to be fun
thats when my days of serial murder manslaughter begun

the sight of blood excites me that might be an artery son
your blood curdling screams just dont seem to bother me none
its 3 am and here i come so you should probably run
a secret passage way around here man theres got to be one
oh no theres probably none he can scream all that he wants
top of his lungs
it aint no stopping me from chopping him up up

cause its 3 am in the mornin
put my key in the door an
bodies laying all over the floor an
i dont remember how they got there but i guess i must have killed em
killed em

i said its 3 am in the mornin

or satan gee what a site to see im dancing in my red panties
im crazy but its alright with me man life can be so empty
stay away from me cause im dancing to quite a different drum beat

soon as my flow starts i compose art like the ghost of mozart
even though they all say that theyre real i know that most arent
boy you think youre clever dont ya girl you think youre so smart
come with me to another side in a world so cold and so dark

stay wide awake a world so dark a world so cold
a world where only some will go
stay wide awake but none return when will they learn
where do they go god only knows
stay wide awake

better try ta stay wide awake or you might end up found dead by the lake
soon as you lay me down to sleep bitch your soul ima try to take
pray for light of day right away why do they try to fight today
i must make them pay twice as much might as well put the knife away

now i use power tools how bout now are you in the shower
scour you for six hours till outage of power outlets
how did ya figure out i was down in your basement now ya
must have just heard the sound of my stomach growlin from down there

prowler theres no one fouler bound ya thats how they found ya
face down in the tub i drown ya with piles of downers around ya
such nostalgia and power such prowess look how ya cower
jump out on you now like i was a jawa from fuckin star wars

jabba the hutt beddy bye-bye beddy bye-bye its time to die-die
oughta not even bother to scream it dont even matta
amazing when grazing skin with these razor blades he waves at ya
not yer everyday damien bathe me in holy water

nothing like son of sam so please understand theres no gun in hand
wheres the thrill in the hunt theres no fun in that here i come with axe
fun ta act like lumberjack when im hackin em up with that
what was that dial 9-1-1 someones comin in from the back

soon as my flow starts i compose art like the ghost of mozart
even though they all say that theyre real i know that most arent
boy you think youre clever dont ya girl you think youre so smart
come with me to another side in a world so cold and so dark

stay wide awake a world so dark a world so cold
a world where only some will go
stay wide awake but none return when will they learn
where do they go god only knows
stay wide awakeeminem

hu-lets movelately ive been hard to reach ive been too long on my own
everybody has a private world where they can be alone
are you calling me are you trying to get through
are you reaching out for me im reaching out for you

im just so fuckin depressed i just cant seem to get out this slump
if i could just get over this hump but i need something to pull me out this dump
i took my bruises took my lumps fell down and i got right back up
but i need that spark to get psyched back up in order for me to pick the mic back up

i dont know how or why or when i ended up in this position im in
im startin to feel distant again so i decided just to pick this pen
up and try to make an attempt to vent but i just cant admit
or come to grips with the fact that i may be done with rap i need a new outlet

and i know some shits so hard to swallow but i just cant sit back and wallow
in my own sorrow but i know one fact ill be one tough act to follow
one tough act to follow ill be one tough act to follow
here today gone tomorrow but youd have to walk a thousand miles

in my shoes just to see what its like to be me
ill be you lets trade shoes just to see what itd be like to
feel your pain you feel mine go inside each others minds
just to see what wed find look at shit through each others eyes

but dont let em say you aint beautiful oh
they can all get fucked just stay true to you
so dont let em say you aint beautiful oh
they can all get fucked just stay true to you so

i think im startin to lose my sense of humor everythings so tense and gloom i
almost feel like i gotta check the temperature of the room just as soon as i
walk in its like all eyes on me and so i try to avoid any eye contact
cause if i do that then it opens the door for conversation like i want that

im not lookin for extra attention i just wanna be just like you
blend in with the rest of the room maybe just point me to the closest restroom
i dont need no fuckin man servant tryin to follow me around and wipe my ass
laugh at every single joke i crack and half of em aint even funny like hah

marshall youre so funny man you should be a comedian goddamn
unfortunately i am i just hide behind the tears of a clown
so why dont you all sit down listen to the tale im about to tell
hell we dont gotta trade our shoes and you aint gotta walk no thousand miles

in my shoes just to see what its like to be me
ill be you lets trade shoes just to see what itd be like to

but dont let em say you aint beautiful oh
they can all get fucked just stay true to you
so dont let em say you aint beautiful oh

nobody asked for life to deal us with these bullshit hands were dealt
we gotta take these cards ourselves and flip em dont expect no help
now i could have either just sat on my ass and pissed an moaned
or take this situation in which im placed in and get up and get my own

i was never the type of kid to wait by the door and pack his bags
or sat on the porch and hoped and prayed for a dad to show up who never did
i just wanted to fit in in every single place every school i went
i dreamed of being that cool kid even if it meant actin stupid

aunt edna always told me keep makin that face itll get stuck like that
meanwhile im just standin there holdin my tongue tryin to talk like this
till i stuck my tongue on that frozen stop sign pole at 8 years old
i learned my lesson then cause i wasnt tryin to impress my friends no more

but i already told you my whole life story not just based on my description
cause where you see it from where your sittin its probably 110% different
i guess we would have to walk a mile in each others shoes at least
what size you wear i wear 10s lets see if you can fit your feet

in my shoes just to see what its like to be me
ill be you lets trade shoes just to see what itd be like to
feel your pain you feel mine go inside each others minds
just to see what wed find look at shit through each others eyes

but dont let em say you aint beautiful oh

{*yawns*} yeah look

if i wouldve rap about the crap thats out thats the route
you probably want me to take cause youre just dyin to know what i think
here my take on some other rappers
if i was to say somethin about paul wall youd probably crap in your pants
cause im white and hes white so hes like
my competition i mean right nope
paul wall is dope and so is bubba so
{*blblblbl pbbbbt*} b-b-b-b-b-b but
i dont compete with nobody
i just go hard do the rope-a-dope ali shuffle
and dance around my opponents do donuts
sometimes i play possum like im asleep its awesome
im like a sleepin giant and when i awake im like dre
i just jump from outta nowhere and bite break
and sink my teeth in em and fill em full of poison
and make a noise like a snake before i kill em
and let em know that i just dont feel em
and smack him with the backward e the eminem emblem
always thought if you was gonna murder somebody you should face em
tell em why look em dead in the eye then waste em
and the dark shall emerge from the fiery depths of hell
then swallow the shell all the hollow who dwell
in the shadows of all who are willing to sell their souls
for this rap game and it g–g-goes
one-two-three chk-chk one-two-three
chk-chk one-two-three that aint the hook now follow me
theres nothing else for me to say my public adores me
everybody bores me theyre just so corny
so at night before i sleep i look in the mirror
the mirror grows lips and it whispers come nearer

 a random drive-by shooting meanwhile eminem is rumored to be

is it a sabbatical or the end the rumors and speculation
 continue to swirl around eminem he insists hes just taking a break
 but doubters believe hes retiring leaving us all to ask
 will the real slim shady please stand up

so this is it this is what i wished for
just isnt how i envisioned it fame to the point of imprisonment
i just thought the shitd be different
theres somethin changed the minute that i got a whiff of it
i started to inhale it smell it started sniffin it
and it became my cocaine i just couldnt quit
i just wanted a little bit
then it turned me to a monster i became a hypocrite
concert after concert i was rakin in the dough rollin in green
had the game hemmed up like a sewing machine
but i was losin my freedom there was nowhere for me
to not go and be seen and just go and be me
and there was no in-between
you either loved it or hate it every cd critics gave it a 3
then three years later they go back and re-rate it
then called the slim shady lp the greatest
the marshall mathers was a classic the eminem show was fantastic
but encore just didnt have the caliber to match it
i guess enough time just aint passed yet
a couple more years that shitll be illmatic
and eight years later im still at it
divorced re-married a felon a father sleepin pill addict
and this is real talk i feel like the incredible hulk
my back has been broke and i can still walk

so be careful what you wish forrrr
cause you just might get it and if you get it
then you just might not knowwww what to do wit it
cause it might just come back on you ten-folllld

cause you just might get it and if you get it
then you just might not knowwww what to do wit it
cause it might just come back on you ten-folllld

i got a letter from a fan that said hes been prayin for me
every day and for some reason its been weighin on my mind heavy
cause i dont read every letter i get
but somethin told me to go ahead and open it
but why would someone pray for you when they dont know you
you didnt pray for me when i was local
and as i lay these vocals i think of all the shit i had to go through
just to get to where im at ive already told you
at least a thousand times in these rhymes
i appreciate the prayer but ive already got god on my side
and its been one hell of a ride hasnt it
just watchin it from a opposite standpoint man boy its got to look
nuts and thats the only word i can think of
right now on how to describe the shit
this is like a vibe you get go ahead and bop to it
just watch what you wish for cause i got the shit

so be careful what you wish forrrr
cause you just might get it and if you get it
then you just might not knowwww what to do wit it
cause it might just come back on you ten-folllld
i said be careful what you wish forrrr
cause you just might get it and if you get it
then you just might not knowwww what to do wit it
cause it might just come back on you ten-folllldguess who

[verse 1 eminem]
you hear the beat as it makes ya not want to go to sleep
i knock on dakotas door its locked so i go to creep
round the back with binoculars not cause i want to peep
but because im hungry she smells like tacos i wanna eat
visions of hot chocolatey marshmallows all so sweet
with sugar plums oh look here comes marshall hes on your street
hes placin hot smolderin charcoals beneath your feet
now walk on em hes dancin with carcasses cheek to cheek
like a thanksgiving turkey a holiday ham
cinnamon sprinkled on toast strawberry marmalade jam
flavor my favorite graham crackers with jon benet rams
i guess a modern day jack the ripper is all that i am

[hook]
cause when the lights are off i see the girls asleep my music box
but i can hear you my love you keep callin me my music box
and when were worlds apart you mean the world to me my music box
if you call ill come i will answer my music box
cause when the lights are off i see the girl’s asleep my music box
i hear my music box playing a song for me my music box
so won’t you twirl around and do a whirl for me my music box
and will you be my private little dancer my music box

[verse 2 eminem]
i almost look comatose who wants to be sober gross
i foam like a doberman mouth open i overdose
put coke up my nostrils in both my holes then i plug my nose
my pupils quadruple in size eyes are so bugged i know
i put on my mothers makeup get naked and run around
wavin the gun around i think im down to a hundred pounds
theres thunder i wonder how come it rains but the sun is out
the devils upset with his wife they must be sluggin it out
i must be buggin the fuck out but what the fuck about
voices are leading me up to the attic i love my house
they pull and they tug my blouse the sound of a music box
comes from inside a toy chest but what do i do its locked
i pick it and open it but its stuffed full of human parts
i dig till i find it i wind it up and the tune it starts
its playin a song so beautiful and the room is dark
the moon is full i smell a funeral guess ill loom in the park

[refrain]

[verse 3 eminem]
im fixated on asphyxiatin
and breakin this little chicks neck like a pixie stick
the sick satan worshippin bitches get horse whippins
im in the back through the back door slippin
through the crack leavin the corpse drippin
the mortician of love sent from above
forced entry to maul when she no more stingy ive become
been doin this for more than a quarter century im just numb
am i dreamin is it real someone pinch me on the buns
the time has come to tie her up
gotta roll me the ladder ive had enough of the chatter
climb up to the window look at her
then climb in slow to shatter her brain matter and batter her
with a bat a matter of fact that will splatter her
but before i do that ill have a chat to flatter her
give her two compliments back to back like tabitha
im your secret admirer im back to ravish ya
so strong is your fight but youre no match for dracula
prolonging her plight as i go back to stabbin her
dismember her limbs simple as that cadaver her

you can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before i lay em
but you wont take the sting out these words before i say em
cause aint no way ima let you stop me from causin mayhem
when i say ima do somethin i do it i dont give a damn

what you think im doin this for me so fuck the world feed it beans
its gassed up if it thinks its stoppin me
ima be what i set out to be without a doubt undoubtedly
and all those who looked down on me im tearin down your balcony

no if ands or buts dont try to ask him why or how can he
from infinite down to the last relapse album hes still shittin
whether hes on salary paid hourly
until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him

whichever comes first for better or worse
hes married to the game like a fuck you for christmas
his gift is a curse forget the earth hes got the urge
to pull his dick from the dirt and fuck the whole universe

im not afraid im not afraid to take a stand to take a stand
everybody everybody come take my hand come take my hand
well walk this road together through the storm
whatever weather cold or warm
just lettin you know that youre not alone
holla if you feel like youve been down the same road

you said you was king you lied through your teeth for that
fuck your feelins instead of gettin crowned youre gettin capped

and to the fans ill never let you down again im back
i promise to never go back on that promise in fact
lets be honest that last relapse cd was eh
perhaps i ran them accents into the ground

relax i aint goin back to that now
all im tryna say is get back click-clack-bloww
cause i aint playin around theres a game called circle
and i dont know how im way too up to back down

but i think im still tryin to figure this crap out
thought i had it mapped out but i guess i didnt this fuckin black cloud
still follows me around but its time to exorcise these demons
these motherfuckers are doin jumpin jacks now

im not afraid im not afraid to take a stand to take a stand
everybody everybody come take my hand come take my hand
well walk this road together through the storm
whatever weather cold or warm
just lettin you know that youre not alone
holla if you feel like youve been down the same road

and i just cant keep livin this way
so startin today im breakin out of this cage
im standin up ima face my demons
im mannin up ima hold my ground
ive had enough now im so fed up
time to put my life back together right now

it was my decision to get clean i did it for me
admittedly i probably did it subliminally for you
so i could come back a brand new me you helped see me through
and dont even realize what you did believe me you

i been through the ringer but they can do little to the middle finger
i think i got a tear in my eye i feel like the king of
my world haters can make like bees with no stingers
and drop dead no more beef flingers

no more drama from now on i promise
to focus solely on handlin my responsibilities as a father
so i solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters and raise it
you couldnt lift a single shingle on it

cause the way i feel im strong enough to go to the club
or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up
cause im raisin the bar i shoot for the moon
but im too busy gazin at stars i feel amazin and im not

im not afraid im not afraid to take a stand to take a stand
everybody everybody come take my hand come take my hand
well walk this road together through the storm
whatever weather cold or warm
just lettin you know that youre not alone
holla if you feel like youve been down the same roadspoken

my body aches when i aint with you i have zero strength
theres no limit on how far i would go no boundaries no lengths
why do we say that until we get that person that we thinks

gonna be that one and then once we get em its never the same
you want em when they dont want you soon as they do feelings change
its not a contest and i aint on no conquest for no mate
i wasnt looking when i stumbled on to you must have been fate

but so much is at stake what the fuck does it take

i poured my heart out to you let down my guard swear to god
ill blow my brains in your lap lay here and die in your arms

drop to my knees and im pleading im trying to stop you from leaving
you wont even listen so fuck it im trying to stop you from breathing
i put both hands on your throat i sit on top of you squeezing
till i snap your neck like a popsicle stick

and tell that psycho to pass the torch to the wacko

 aw man yea
 you ever be in the club man you get in a fight
 and people that you dont even know jump in

  [verse 1]
 you feel like you wanna hit something your fist clenches your pissed
 you just wanna get someone with shit jump on this
 youre bout to get your shit pushed in im just inches away 
im splitting your shit wide open no stitches could save
 so die with your eyes open you hope this isnt the way 
you end up going out but i guess it just is im afraid
 razors scissors and blades make jason say isnt this great
 on-lookers participate in this ass-kicking debate
 theyre starting to take place in the middle of the street
 little did you know thered be an all-out brawl soon as you heard this beat 
emergency personnel rush to the murder scene but its too late its absolute pandemonium whisked away
 in a ambulance is your fate nothing nobody told you when you- left your house today coulda made you anticipate 
such an ass whooping okay til the anger dissipates 
you get punched in the face reciprocate  

[chorus x2] so what the deal ridaz 
would you excuse me while i feel my nuts
 my balls are feeling a-mighty big now 
i might just have to dig down and pull em through my britches
 i said

  [verse 2]
 you step in the place with enough misplaced anger to catch a case
 anxious to get in some shit got your gangstas all with your ladies
 you better go get your mace cuz shady said so you may wanna pick up the radio and bang it against your face 
thats how fucking rowdy you feel now do you still wanna grill
 if you dont wanna get the shit beat outta you chill
 cuz if you doubt me you will yea got me a pill found me a thrill
 i got a couple of drinks here and im bound to refill 
girl howdy how do you feel ma
 this cocksucker did not spill my drink oh hell no he must be tryna kill my buzz i will not budge
 and what the deal ridaz
 now here they all come and they got your back in like 2 seconds flat 
thats probably a record yea you wasnt expecting that 
cuz they want in on the act theres a cognac- bottle we snuck it in cuz the beer that they were serving here was only tap
 im biting i fight dirty you might get kicked in the nuts 
youre frightened like this guy might hurt me youre quite certain hes nuts ive hit myself in the face harder 
play smarter you may start a rumble you need a chainsaw to 
dig your way out of go powder your nose- pussy the harder you yell the harder i slap the shit out of you hoes
you set it off faggot so now how do you spose- we settle it hit me in the nose well see how it goes  

[chorus x2]  

its shear hustle i bob weave deflate your beer muscles
 were tussling the crowds starting to cheer us
 and adrenalines rushing through us just like a geyser gushing 
too much budweiser in my blood im strangling your windpipe for nothing my signatures ligature marks
look at you all big with your remarks and i swing an icepick at your heart
 at least thats what it feels like when i pick you apart
and dig at you and break you down like the bitch that you are
 the predicament starts when i throw a brick at your car
 the pain inflicted upon you its so sick its bizarre 
shit this is almost ridiculous addictive as far
as having me wanna rip out your frickin ligaments argh
 you hit like a bitch you scratch me with your nails for that- you catch an open-hand slap like a female like bap
in fact ill have the crowd smacking you themselves wheres d12 i dont feel like doing this by myself

  [chorus x2]ladies and gentlemen make some noise
aww shit yeah
yall ready to get this shit started or what
aiight well i brought some friends with me too

millions of questions arose after they did an inspection

slaughterhouse cuz to us its so easy wheres jump-off joe beezyits like im in this dirt digging up old hurt
tried everything to get my mind off you it wont work
all it takes is one song on the radio youre right back on it
reminding me all over again how you fucking just brushed me off
and left me so burnt spent a lot of time trying to soul search
maybe i needed to grow up a little first
well looks like i hit a growth spurt
but im coming for closure
dont suppose an explanation im owed for
the way that you turned your back on me
just when i may have needed you most
oh you thought it was over
you could just close the chapter
and go about your life like it was nothing
you ruined mine but you seem to be doing fine
well ive never recovered but tonight betcha that whatcha
bout to go throughs tougher than anything i ever have suffered
cant think of a better way to define poetic justice
can i hold grudges mind saying let it go fuck this
hearts saying i will once i bury this bitch alive
hide the shovel and then drive off in the sunset

i flee the scene like it was my last ride
you see right through oh you had me pegged the first time
you can see the truth but its easier to justify
whats bad is good and i hate to be the bad guy
i just hate to be the bad guy
follow me i run i run follow me follow me
i just hate to be the bad guy

and to think i used to think you was the shit bitch
to think it was you at one time i worshiped shit
think you can hurt people and just keep getting away with it
not this time you better go and get sewing kit bitch
finish this stitch so you can reap what you sew knit wit
thought some time would pass and id forget it forgit it
you left our family in shambles
and you expect me to just get over him pretend he never existed
maybe gone but hes not forgotten
and dont think cause hes been out the picture so long
that ive stopped the plotting and still aint coming to get ya
youre wrong and that shit was rotten
and the way you played hims same shit you did to me cold
have you any idea the shit that ive gone through
feelings i harbor all this pent-up resentment i hold on to
not once you call to ask me how im doing
letters you dont respond to em
fuck it im coming to see you
and gee who better to talk to than you
the cause of my problems
my life is garbage and im bout to take it out on you
poof then im gone voosh

i flee the scene like it was my last ride
you see right through oh you had me pegged the first time
you can see the truth but its easier to justify
whats bad is good and i hate to be the bad guy
i just hate to be the bad guy
follow me i run i run follow me follow me
i just hate to be the bad guy

ive been driving around your side of this town
like nine fricking hours and forty-five minutes now
finally i found your new address park in your drive
feel like ive been waiting on this moment all of my life
and its now arrived and my mouth is fulla saliva
my knife is out and im ducking on the side of your house
see its sad it came to this point
such a disappointment i had to make this appointment to come and see ya
but i aint here for your empathy i dont need your apology
or your friendship or sympathy its revenge that i seek
so i sneak vengefully and treat your bedroom window
like i reach my full potential i peeked
continue to peep still bent low then
keep tapping the glass lightly then start to crescendo
sneak all the way round to the back porch
man door handles unlocked shouldnt be that easy to do this
you dont plan for intruders beforehand
surprised to see me cat got your tongue
gag chloroform rag dag almost hack-up a lung
like you picked an axe up and swung
stick to the core plan dragged to the back of a trunk
by one of your fans ironys spectacular huh
now whos a faggot you punk
and heres your bronco hat you can have that shit back cause they suck
its just me you and the music now slim
i hope you hear it were in a car right now
wait here comes my favorite lyric
im the bad guy who makes fun of people that die
and hey heres the sequel to my mathers lp
just to try to get people to buy
well hows this for publicity stunt this should be fun
last album now cause after this youll be officially done
eminem killed by m and m
matthew mitchell bitch i even have your initials
i initially was gonna bury you next to my brother but fuck it
since youre in love with your city so much
i figured what the fuck the best place you could be buried alive is right here
two more exits time is quite near
hope we dont get stopped no license i fear
that sirens i hear guess ninety on the freeway wasnt the brightest idea
as cops appear in my drivers side mirror
oh god police ah
hope fox trot gets an aerial shot of your burial plot
new plan stan
slim chauvinist pig drove in this big lincoln town car
well gotta go almost at the bridge ha ha big bro its for you
slim this is for him and frank ocean oh hope you can swim good
now say you hate homos again

i also represent anyone on the receiving end of those jokes you offend
im the nightmare you fell asleep and then woke up still in
im your karma closing in with each stroke of a pen
perfect time to have some remorse to show for your sin
nope its hopeless im the denial that youre hopelessly in
when they say all of this is approaching its end
but you refuse to believe that its over here we go all over again
backs to the wall im stacking up all them odds toilets clogged
yeah cause im talking a lotta shit but im backing it all up
but in my head theres a voice in the back and it hollers
after the track is demolished i am your lack of a conscience
im the ringing in your ears im the polyps on the back of your tonsils
eating your vocal chords after your concerts
im your time thats almost up that you havent acknowledged
grab for some water but im that pill thats too jagged to swallow
im the bullies you hate that you became
with every faggot you slaughtered
coming back on ya every woman you insult
batter but the double standard you have when it comes to your daughters
i represent everything you take for granted
cause marshall mathers the rappers personas half a facade and 
matthew and stans just symbolic of you not knowing what you have til its gone
cause after all the glitz and the glam no more fans that are calling your name
cameras are off sad but it happens to all of them
im the hindsight to say i told you so
foreshadows of all the things that are to follow
im the future thats here to show you what happens tomorrow
if you dont stop after they call ya
biggest laughing stock of rap who can’t call it quits
when its time to walk away
im every guilt trip the baggage you have
but as you gather up all your possessions
if theres anything you have left to say
less it makes an impact then dont bother
so fore you rest your case
better make sure youre packing a wallop
so one last time im back
fore it fades into black and its all over
behold the final chapter in a saga
trying to recapture that lightning trapped in a bottle
twice the magic that started it all
tragic portrait of an artist tortured
trapped in his own drawings
tap into thoughts
blacker and darker than anything imaginable
here goes a wild stab in the dark
uh as we pick up where the last mathers left offdont kill me
thank you
go go go what the fuck
what the fuck are you doing
mothafucker bail on me fuck you
aw you gotta be fucking kidding me
are you fucking kidding me
shit
get off
haha
the parking lot
shit ah
let me see your hands pranks over
fuck itwhats your name marshall
whos your daddy i dont have one
my mother reproduced like a komodo dragon
and had me on the back of a motorcycle
then crashed in the side of loco-motive with rap im loco
its like handing a psycho a loaded handgun
michelangelo with a paint gun in a tantrum
about to explode all over the canvas
back with the yoda of rap in a spasm
your music usually has them
but waned for the game your enthusiasm it hasnt
follow you must rick rubin my little padawan
a jedi in training colossal brain and thoughts of entertaining
but docile and impossible to explain and im also vain and
probably find a way to complain about a picasso painting
puke skywalker but sound like chewbacca when i talk
full of such blind rage i need a seeing eye dog
cant even find the page i was writing this rhyme on oh
its on a rampage couldnt see what i wrote i write small
it says ever since i drove a 79 lincoln with white walls
had a fire in my heart and a dire desire to aspire to die hard
so as long as im on the clock punching this time card
hip hop aint dying on my watch

but sometimes when i’m sleeping she comes to me in my dreams
is she taken is she mine don’t got don’t care don’t have two shits to give
let me take you by the hand to promise land and threaten everyone
cause there’s no rhyme or no reason for nothing

nah whats your name marshall
who’s your daddy i don’t know him but i wonder
is he rich like me haha
has he taken any time to show you what you need to live
no

if he had he wouldn’t have ended up in these rhymes on my pad
i wouldn’t be so mad my attitude wouldn’t be so bad yeah dad
im the epitome and the prime example of what happens
when the power of the rhyme falls into the wrong hands and
makes you want to get up and start dancing
even if it is charles manson who just happens to be rapping
blue lights flashing laughing all the way to the bank
lamping in my k-mart mansion i’m in the style department
with a pile in my car ripping the aisle apart
with great power comes absolutely no responsiblity for content
completely despondent and condescending
the king of nonsense and controversy is on a
beat killing spree your honor i must plead
guilty cause i sparked a revolution
rebel without a cause who caused the evolution of rap
to take it to the next level boost it
but several rebuked it and whoever produced it
hip hop is the devils music is that me it belongs to me
cuz i just happen to be a white honky devil with two horns
that dont honk but every time i speak you hear a beep
but lyrically i never hear a peep not even a whisper
rappers better stay clear of me bitch
cause its the…

time of the season when hate runs high
and this time wont give it to you easy when i take back whats mine with pleasured hands and torture everyone that is my plan my job here isnt done
cause there’s no rhyme or no reason for nothing

whats your name shady
who’s your daddy i don’t give a fuck but i wonder
is he rich like me doubt it ha
has he taken any time to show you what you need to live

so yeah dad lets walk
lets have us a father and son talk
but i bet we wouldnt probably  get one block
without me knocking your block off
this is all your fault
maybe thats why im so bananas
i appeal to all those walks of life
whoever had strife

ten year old degenerate grabbing on my genitals

this is survival of the fittest
this is do or die
this is the winner takes it all
so take it all

[verse 1]
wasnt ready to be no millionaire i was ill-prepared
i was prepared to be ill though the skill was there
in the beginning it wasnt bout the ends
it was bout busting raps and standing for something fuck an acronym
cut the fucking act like youre happy im fucking back again
with another anthem why stop when it doesnt have to end
it aint over til i say its over – enough when i say enough
throw me to them wolves and close the gate up
im afraid of whatll happen to them wolves
when the thought of being thrown into an alligator pit i salivated it
raise your hands up like its 12 noon nah homie
hold them bitches straighter up wave em til you dislocate a rotator cuff
came up rough came to ruffle feathers nah egos
i aint deflate enough last chance to make this whole stadium erupt

[hook]

[verse 2]
i can see the finish line with each line that i finish
im so close to my goals i can almost pole vault over the goal post
and if i dont got enough in the tank maybe i can just siphon enough
to fill up this last can man will i survive in this climate or what
they said i was washed up and got a blood bath
im not a rapper im an adapter i can adjust
plus i can just walk up to a mic and just bust
so floors open if youd like to discuss
top 5 in this mothafucka and if i dont make the cut
what like i give a fuck i will light this bitch up like im driving a truck
into the side of a pump 0 to 60 hop in and gun it
like g-unit without the hyphen im hyping em up
and if there should ever come a time where my lifes in a rut
and i look like i might just give up eh you mightve mistook
me for bowing out i aint taking a bow im stabbing myself
with a fucking knife in the gut while im wiping my butt
cause i just shitted on the mic and i like getting cut
i get excited at the sight of my blood youre in a fight with a nut
cause imma fight til i die or win
biting the dust itll just make me angrier wait
let me remind you of what got me this far picture me quitting
now draw a circle around it and put a line through it slut
its survival of what

[hook]

[verse 3]
so get your ideas stack your ammo
but dont come unless you come to battle im mad now jump in the saddle
this is it its what you eat sleep piss and shit
live breathe your whole existence just consists of this
refuse to quit fuse is lit cant diffuse the wick
i dont do this music shit i lose my shit
aint got shit to lose its the moment of truth
its all i know how to do as soon as i get thrown in the booth i spit
but my respect is overdue im showing you the flow no one do
cause i dont own no diploma for school i quit
so theres nothing for me to fall back on i know no other trades
so youd better trade your fucking mics in for some tool-box-es
cause youll never take my pride from me
itll have to be pried from me so pull out your pliers and your screwdrivers
but i want you to doubt me i dont want you to buh-lieve
cause this is something that i must use to suc-ceed
and if you dont like me then fuck you
self es-teem must be fucking shooting through-the-roof cause trust me
my skin is too thick and bul-let proof to touch me
i can see why the fuck i disgust you

i just sneeze but i just go atchoo then achieve

[hook]eminem with polina 
tell me where to go tell me what to do
ill be right there for you
tell me what to say no matter if its true
ill say it all for you

i used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky is falling
why am i so differently wired am i a martian
what kind of twisted experiment am i involved in
cause i dont belong in this world that’s why im scoffing

at authority defiant often flying off at
the handle at my mom no dad so i’m non-com-
-pliant at home at school i’m just shy and awkward
and no i don’t need no goddamn psychologist

tryna diagnose why i have all these underlying problems
thinking he can try and solve them
i’m outside chalking up drawings on the sidewalk
and in the front drive talking to myself

either that or inside hiding off in the corner somewhere quiet
trying not to be noticed cause im crying and sobbing
i had a bad day at school so i aint talking
some cocksucker shoved me into a fucking locker cause he said that i eyeballed him

and if you fall ill get you there
ill be your savior from all the wars that are fought
inside your world please have faith in my words

cause this is my legacy legacy eh
this is my legacy legacy eh
there’s no guarantee it’s not up to me you can only see
this is my legacy legacy
legacy legacy

i used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky is falling
why am i so differently wired in my noggin
cause sporadic as my thoughts come its mind boggling
cause i obsess on everything in my mind is small shit

bothers me but now my father he said sayonara
and then split but i don’t give a shit im fine long as
theres batteries in my walkman nothing is the matter with me
shit look at the bright side at least i aint walking

i bike ride through the neighborhood of my apartment
complex on a ten speed which ive acquired parts that i
find in the garbage a frame then put tires on it
headphones on straight ahead kids tryna start shit

but if this is all there is for me life offers
why bother even try and put up a fight its nonsense
but i think a light bulb just lit up in my conscience
what about them rhymes ive been jottin theyre kinda giving me confidence

instead of tryna escape through my comics
why dont i just blast a little something like onyx
to put me in the mood to wanna fight and write songs that
say what i wanna say to the kid that said that i eyeballed him

grab hold of my balls like thats right fights on bitch
who wouldve knew from the moment i turned the mic on that
i could be iconic in my conquest is
thats word to phife dawg from a tribe called quest

this is my legacy legacy eh
this is my legacy legacy eh
there’s no guarantee it’s not up to me you can only see
this is my legacy legacy
legacy legacy

i used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky is falling
now i think the fact that im differently wireds awesome
cause if i wasnt i wouldnt be able to work
words like this and connect lines like crosswords

and use my enemys words as strength
to try and draw from and get inspired off em
cause all my life i was told and taught i am not shit
by you whack fucking giant sacks of lying dog shit

now you shut up bitch i am talking
thought i was full of horseshit and now you fucking worship the ground on which i am walking
me against the world so what im brian dawkins
versus the whole 0 and 16 lions offense

so bring on the giants falcons and miami dolphins
its the body bag game bitch im supplying coffins
cause you dicks butt-kiss a bunch of brian baldingers
you gon die a ball-licker

ive been diabolical with this dialogue since 99 rawkus
you dont respect the legacy i leave behind yall can
suck a dick the day you beat me pigsll fly out my ass
and a flying saucer full of italian sausage

the most high exalting and i aint halting
till i die of exhaustion inhale my exhaust fumes
the best part about me is i am not you
im me and im the fire marshal and

this is my legacy legacy eh
this is my legacy legacy eh
there’s no guarantee it’s not up to me you can only see
this is my legacy legacy

i came to the world at a time when it was in need of a villain
an asshole that role i think i succeed in fulfilling
but dont think i ever stopped
to think i was speaking to children
everything was happening so fast
it was like i blinked sold three million
then it all went blank all i remember
is feeling ridiculous cause i was getting sick of this feeling
like i am always under attack man
i could have stacked my shit list to the ceiling
women dish him but really thinking
if anyone ever talks to one of my little girls like this i would kill him
guess im a little bit of a hypocrite
when im ripping shit but since when did this many
people ever give a shit but i had to say
its just my opinion
if it contradicts how im living
put a dick in your rear end and guess what
every time you mention a lyric i thank you for it
for drawing more attention toward it
cause it gave me an enormous platform of platitude
thought i was that important
but you cant ignore the fact that i fought for the respect
and battle for it mad awards act paranoid
attaboy they told me to slow down and i just zone out
good luck trying to convince a blonde
thats like telling gwen stefan that she sold out
cause i was tryna leave no doubt
in anyones mind one day id go down
in history think they know now
because everybody knows

skylar
everybody knows that youre just an asshole
everywhere that you go people wanna go home everyone knows
everybody knows so dont pretend to be nice
theres no place you can hide

everyone knows everyone knows

eminem
thanks for the support asshole thanks for the support asshole
quit acting salty i was counting on you to count me out as asher roth
when he round-a-bout dissed me to shout me out
thought i was history
but goddamn honkey that compliments like backhanding a donkey
good way to get your ass socked in the mouth
layem off it
but what the fuck is all this thrash talking about
the fight was fixed im back and you cant stop me
you knock me down i went down for the count
i fell but the fans caught me and now
youre gonna have to beat the fuckin pants off me
to take my belt word to pacquiao
momma said there aint nothing else to talk about
gotta go in that ring and knock them out
or you better not come out
its poetry in motion like freddie roach when hes quoting shakespeare
so what if the insults are revolting
even helen keller knows life stinks
you think its a joke til youre bullet riddled
but you should give little shit what i think
this whole world is a mess
gotta have a goddamn vest on your chest and a glock
just to go out watch batman
who needs a test to test the testicles not that man
half of you dont got the guts and intestinal blockage
rest of you got lap bands stuck to this model
before they put bathsalts and all those water bottles in colorado
so get lost waldo
my souls escaping through this asshole that is gaping
a black hole that im swallowing this track whole
with a pack torn of paper
but im not taking no crap ho
here i go down the back pole
and im changing back into that old maniac in fact there it go
trying to dip through the back door retreating cause everybody knows

skylar
everybody knows that youre just an asshole
everywhere that you go people wanna go home everyone knows
everybody knows so dont pretend to be nice
theres no place you can hide

you are just what the doctor ordered

im beginning to feel like a rap god rap god
all my people from the front to the back nod back nod
now who thinks their arms are long enough to slapbox slapbox
they said i rap like a robot so call me rapbot

but for me to rap like a computer must be in my genes
i got a laptop in my back pocket
my penll go off when i half-cock it
got a fat knot from that rap profit
made a living and a killing off it
ever since bill clinton was still in office
with monica lewinsky feeling on his nut-sack
im an mc still as honest
but as rude and indecent as all hell
syllables skill-a-holic kill em all with
this slickety-gippety-hippity-hip-hop
you dont really wanna get into a pissing match with this rappity-rap
packing a mack in the back of the ac backpack rap yap-yap yacketty-yack
and now at the exact same time
i attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while im practicing that
ill still be able to break a motherfuckin table
over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
only realized it was ironic i was signed to aftermath after the fact
how could i not blow all i do is drop f-bombs feel my wrath of attack
rappers are having a rough time period heres a maxi-pad
its actually disastrously bad for the wack
while im masterfully constructing this masterpiece yeah

cause im beginning to feel like a rap god rap god
all my people from the front to the back nod back nod
now who thinks their arms are long enough to slapbox slapbox
let me show you maintaining this shit aint that hard that hard

everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like i have got
well to be truthful the blueprints simply rage and youthful exuberance
everybody loves to root for a nuisance
hit the earth like an asteroid i did nothing but shoot for the moon since
*pew*
mcs get taken to school with this music
cause i use it as a vehicle to bus the rhyme
now i lead a new school full of students
me im a product of rakim lakim shabazz 2pac n-
-wa cube hey doc ren yella eazy thank you they got slim
inspired enough to one day grow up blow up and be in a position
to meet run-dmc and induct them into the motherfuckin rock n
roll hall of fame
even though ill walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
only hall of fame i be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
on the wall of shame
you fags think its all a game til i walk a flock of flames
off a plank and tell me what in the fuck are you thinking
little gay looking boy
so gay i can barely say it with a straight face looking boy
you witnessing a massacre
like you watching a church gathering take place looking boy
oy vey that boys gay thats all they say looking boy
you get a thumbs up pat on the back
and a way to go from your label everyday looking boy
hey looking boy what you say looking boy
i get a hell yeah from dre looking boy
imma work for everything i have
never asked nobody for that shit get outta my face looking boy
basically boy youre never gonna be capable
of keeping up with the same pace looking boy

cause im beginning to feel like a rap god rap god
all my people from the front to the back nod back nod
the way im racing around the track call me nascar nascar
dale earnhardt of the trailer park the white trash god
kneel before general zod this planets krypton no asgard asgard

so you be thor and ill be odin
you rodent im omnipotent
let off then im reloading immediately with these bombs im totin
and i should not be woken
im the walking dead but im just a talking head a zombie floating
but i got your mom deep throating
im out my ramen noodle
we have nothing in common poodle
im a doberman pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage pupil
its me my honestys brutal
but its honestly futile if i dont utilize what i do though
for good at least once in a while
so i wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch i scribble and doodle
enough rhymes to maybe try to help get some people through tough times
but i gotta keep a few punchlines just in case cause even you unsigned
rappers are hungry looking at me like its lunchtime
i know there was a time where once i
was king of the underground but i still rap like im on my pharoahe monch grind
so i crunch rhymes but sometimes when you combine
appeal with the skin color of mine
you get too big and here they come trying to censor you
like that one line i said on im back from the mathers lp
one where i tried to say id take seven kids from columbine
put em all in a line add an ak-47 a revolver and a nine
see if i get away with it now that i aint as big as i was but im
morphin into an immortal coming through the portal
youre stuck in a timewarp from 2004 though
and i dont know what the fuck that you rhyme for
youre pointless as rapunzel with fucking cornrows
you write normal fuck being normal
and i just bought a new raygun from the future
to just come and shoot ya like when fabolous made ray j mad
cause fab said he looked like a fag at maywhether’s pad
singin to a man while he played piano
man oh man that was the 24/7 special on the cable channel
so ray j went straight to the radio station the very next day
hey fab imma kill you
lyrics coming at you at supersonic speed jj fad
uh sama lamaa duma lamaa you assuming im a human
what i gotta do to get it through to you im superhuman
innovative and im made of rubber
so that anything you say is ricocheting off of me and itll glue to you
im devastating more than never demonstrating
how to give a motherfuckin audience a feeling like its levitating
never fading and i know the haters are forever waiting
for the day that they can say i fell off theyll be celebrating
cause i know the way to get em motivated
i make elevating music you make elevator music
oh hes too mainstream
well thats what they do when they get jealous they confuse it
its not hip-hop its pop cause i found a hella way to fuse it
with rock shock rap with doc
throw on lose yourself and make em lose it
i dont know how to make songs like that
i dont know what words to use
let me know when it occurs to you
while i’m ripping any one of these verses diverse as you
it’s curtains i’m inadvertently hurtin you
how many verses i gotta murder to prove
that if you were half as nice your songs and you could sacrifice virgins too
school flunky pill junky
but look at the accolades these skills brung me
full of myself but still hungry
i bully myself cause i make me do what i put my mind to
and im a million leagues above you ill when i speak in tongues
but its still tongue and cheek fuck you
im drunk so satan take the fucking wheel im asleep in the front seat
bumping heavy d &amp; the boys still chunky but funky
but in my head theres something i can feel tugging and struggling
angels fight with devils and heres what they want from me
they asking me to eliminate some of the women hate
but if you take into consideration the bitter hatred that i had
then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation
and understand the discrimination
but fuck it lifes handing you lemons make lemonade then
but if i cant batter the women how the fuck am i supposed to bake them a cake then
dont mistake it for satan
its a fatal mistake if you think i need to be overseas
and take a vacation to trip a broad
and make her fall on her face and dont be a retard
be a king think not - why be a king when you can be a godeminem has a line full of chainsaws

who can say fore sure
perhaps a frontal lobotomy would be the answer
if science can operate on this distorted brain and put it to good use
society will reap a great benefit

i walk around like a space cadet place your bets
on whos likely to become a serial killer case of tourettes
fuck fuck fuck cant take the stress
i make a mess as the day progresses
angry and take it out on the neighbors hedges
like this is how ill cut your face up bitches
with these hedge trimming scissors with razor edges
imaginations dangerous its the only way to escape this
mess and make the best of this situation i guess
cuz i feel like a little bitch this predicaments  despicable
im sick of just getting pushed its ridiculous
i look like a freaking wuss a pussy
this kid just took my stick of liquorice
and threw my sticker books in a picker bush
i wanna kick his tush but i was six and shook
this fucker was 12 and was 6 foot with a vicious hook
he hit me i fell i got back up all i did was book now theres using your head

mama always said if you had a brain youd be dangerous
a brain youd be dangerous mama could be wrong
mama ima grow a name and be famous
and imma be a pain in the anus
mama could be wrong
imma use my head as a weapon
find a way to escape this insaneness
mama always said son if you had a brain youd be dangerous
guess it pays to be brainless

fast forward some years later
a teenager this is a fun sweet
i just got jumped twice in one week its complete
its usually once a month this is some feat ive accomplished
theyve stomped me into the mud for what reason you stumped me
but how do you get the shit beat out of you be down and be upbeat
when you dont have no-thing no valid shot at life
chance to make it or succeed
cuz youre doomed from the start
its like you grew up on drug street from jump street
but if i had just get my head out my ass
i could accomplish any task
practicing trash talking in a trance
locked in my room yeah but i got some plans mama
these damn rhymes are falling
out of my pants pocket i cant stop it
and im starting to blend in more school this shit helps for sure
im getting more self assured than ive ever been before
plus no one picks on me anymore i done put a stop to that
threw my first punch end of story
still in my skulls a vacant empty void
been using it more as a bin for storage
take some inventory and as gorge as a ford engine door hinge syringe an orange an extension cord and a ninja sword
not to mention four lynch pins and a stringent stored ironing board a bench a wrench or winch and a tangent whore
everything but a brain but domes off the fucking chain
like an independent store somethings wrong with my head
just think if i had a brain in it thank god that i dont
cause id probably be dahmer cause mama always said

mama always said if you had a brain youd be dangerous
a brain youd be dangerous mama could be wrong
mama ima grow a name and be famous
and imma be a pain in the anus
mama could be wrong
imma use my head as a weapon
find a way to escape this insaneness
mama always said son if you had a brain youd be dangerous
guess it pays to be brainless

now my mum goes “womp womp womp”
cause im not that smart but im not dumb
i was on a bottom of the pile getting stomped
but somehow i came out on top

i told you one day i said theyd have that red carpet rolled out yo
im nice yo fuck it im out cold
now everywhere i go they scream out go
im bout to clean house yo
im lysol now im just household
outsold the sell outs freak the hell out
middle america hear them yell out
until they were so scared and those kids
just about belted out
whatever spout that it fell out
of my smart aleck mouth it was so weird
inappropriate so be it i dont see it
maybe one day when the smoke clears it wont be as
motherfuckin difficult ye till then
hopefully you little homos get over your fears and grow beards
its okay to be scared straight they said i provoke queers
till emotions evoke tears my whole careers a stroke of sheer genius
smoke and mirrors tactical practical jokes yeah
you motherfuckin insert insult here
who the fuck wouldve thought that one little lone mc would be able to take the whole culture and re-upholstery it
and boy did they flock
cant believe this little hick locked
this hip hop shit in his hip pocket
and still the shit got that
white trash traffic and gridlock
shit hopping like a six blocks from a kid rock
insane clown posse concert in mid-october
and god forbid i see a wizard and get a brain in my titanium cranium dog
cause i turn into the unabomber mama always said

oh well guess beggars cant be choosey
wanted to receive attention for my music
wanted to be left alone public excuse me

been wanting my cake and eat it too wanting it both ways
fame made me a balloon cause my ego inflated
when i blew seep it was confusing
cause all i wanted to do is be the bruce lee of loose leaf

abused ink used it as a tool when i blew steam
ooh hit the lottery oh wee
with what i gave up to get was bittersweet
it was like winning a huge meet

ironic cause i think im getting so huge i need a shrink

you trying to save me stop holding your breath
and you think im crazy yeah you think im crazy

now i aint much of a poet
but i know somebody once told me to seize the moment
and dont squander it
cause you never know when it could all be over

tomorrow so i keep conjuring
sometimes i wonder where these thoughts spawn from
yeah ponder it do you want this
no wonder youre losing your mind the way it wanders

yodel-odel-ay-hee-hoo

down yonder and stumbled upon jeff vanvonderen

cause i needed an intervention in this

without someone passing through my sub harassing
id count my blessings but i suck at math

maybe thats why i cant leave detroit
its the motivation that keeps me going
this is the inspiration i need
i can never turn my back on a city that made me
lifes been good to me so far

id rather be an encyclopedia britannica hell with a playstation
im still on my first manual from zelda
nintendo bitch run jump punch stab and i melt the
mozzarella on my spaghetti put in on bread
make a sandwich with welchs and belch
they say this spray butter is bad for my health but
i think theres more white trash from the trailer
jed clampett redd sanford welfare mentality helps to
keep me grounded thats why i never take full advantage of wealth i
managed to dwell within these parameters
still cramming the shelves full of hamburger helper
i cant even help it this is the hand i was dealt to
creature of habit feel like im trapped in an animal shelter
with all these pet peeves
god dammit to hell i cant stand all these kids with their camera cellphones
i cant go anywhere i get so mad i can yell the
other day someone got little elaborate and stuck a fucking dead cat in my mailbox
went to burger king they spit on my onion rings
i think my karma is catching up with me

maybe thats why i feel so strange
got it all but i still wont change
maybe thats why i cant leave detroit
its the motivation that keeps me going
this is the inspiration i need
i can never turn my back on a city that made me
lifes been good to me so far

got friends on facebook all over the world
not sure what that means they tell me its good
so im artist of the decade i even got a plaque
id hang it up but the frame is all cracked

im trying to be low key hopefully nobody notices me
in produce hunched over giant nosebleed

by the frozen yogurt this guy approached me
embarrassed i just did comerica with hova

they want me to flip at the label but i wont succumb to it
the pressure they want me to follow up with another one after recovery
was so highly coveted but what good is a fucking recovery if i fumble it
cause imma drop the ball if i dont get a grip
hopping on shrubbery on you sons of bitches
wrong subdivison to fuck with bitch

i love my titty but you push me to my limit what a pity
the shit i complain about
its like there aint a cloud in the sky and its raining out
kool aid stain on the couch id never get it out
bitch i got an elevator in my house
ants and a mouse im living the dream

maybe thats why i feel so strange
got it all but i still wont change
maybe thats why i cant leave detroit
its the motivation that keeps me going
this is the inspiration i need
i can never turn my back on a city that made me
lifes been good to me so fareminem
somethins burnin i cant figure out what out what
its either lust or a cloud of dust
judgement is clouded must just be the powder from the power of love
but im in somethin i dont know how to get out of
left my girl in the house alone
is that my soon to be spouse’s moan
and the further i walked allowed her
i paused for a minute to make something thats what i heard
cuz after all this is her place
so i gave her the benefit of the doubt-a
think i might be about busta busta
the thoughts so scary yo that it hurts brace
hope it aint there we go yo
cause my head already goes to worst case scenario though in the first place
but you confirmed my low end theory though
shouldve known when i made it all the way to third base
and that was only the first date coulda made it to home plate
but you slid straight for the dome and dove face first
no you dont under stand i dont do this for anyone ever

game of love love love love

she screamed she loves me like she never did before
and i told her

and i told her
go where you want and go do what you want to do; i dont care

eminem
so needless to say im feeling betrayed
snatched my housekey off my keychain
she jumped off wee-bey from the wire escape
now shes chasin me with a cheese grater
here goes that broken record cliche its all my fault anyway
shes turnin the tables im a beat-break
treats my face like seratos she cuts and scratches like a dj
each day is an instant replay
they sayin we display cinethematic abatic behavior
back together but forgot today was her b-day cut me off on the freeway
simple misunderstandin but just as i went to slam on the brakes
then i realized that she may be as crazy as me wait
bitch cut my fuckin brakeline stepped on them fuckers 8 times

but them other f-u-c-ks all would of hit the off ramp
so i coast into a gosh damned aww hit a fuckin tree

snatch the bitch out her car through the window she screamin
i body slam her onto the cement until the concrete gave and created a sinkhole

guess i eventually caved though cause shes layin next to me in bed
directly aimin a gat at my head
woke up again and jumped up like fuck it ive had it im checkin into rehab
i confess im a static addict i guess thats why im so clingy
every girl ive ever had either says i got to much baggage
or im just too dramatic
man what the fuck is the matter im just a fucking romantic
i fucking love you you fucking bitch
combative possessive in fact last time i was mad at an ex
i actually set off a chain reaction a tragic event
i said hit the road and after she left
i sent that bitch a text
i said be careful driving dont read this and have a accident
she glanced to look at it and write too bad
thought we had a connect
no sense dwelling makes never been a more compelling case
than a model covered in loreal and mace who fell from grace
eleven stories for story telling but the whore was yelling rape
so the vocal cords were swelling and her voice were more hoarser than tori spellings face
still they swarm the gates and my fans making stakes to greet norman bates with a warm embrace
unless youre andrea yates dont ask me for a date dont be late
well the sentiments great but wait then theres been a mistake
you want an intimate date i wanna intimidate
i have infinite hate in my blood its mainly because of the game of--
[message sound] wait dinner at eight
i have infinite hate in my blood its mainly because of the

game of love love love love
la-la la-la-la-lovenate
mom i know i let you down
and though you say the days are happy
whys the power off and im fucked up

and mom i know hes not around
but dont you place the blame on me
as you pour yourself another drink

i guess we are who we are
headlights shining in the dark night i drive on
maybe we took this too far

eminem
i went in headfirst never thinking about who what i said hurt
in what verse my mom probably got it the worst the brunt of it
but as stubborn as we are did i take it too far
cleaning out my closet and all them other songs but regardless i dont hate you cause ma

youre still beautiful to me cause youre my mom
though far be it from you to be calm our house was vietnam
desert storm and both of us put together can form an atomic bomb
equivalent to chemical warfare and forever we can drag this on and on

but agree to disagree that gift for me up under the christmas tree dont mean shit to me
youre kicking me out its 15 degrees and its christmas eve little prick just leave
ma let me grab my fucking coat anything to have each others goats
why are we always at each others throats especially when dad he fucked us both

were in the same fucking boat youd think that itd make us close nope
further away that drove us but together headlights shine and car full of belongings
still got a ways to go back to grandmas house its straight up the road
and i was the man of the house the oldest so my shoulders carried the weight of the load

then nate got taken away by the state at 8 years old and
thats when i realized you were sick and it wasnt fixable or changeable
and to this day we remained estranged and i hate it though but

nate
i guess we are who we are
headlights shining in the dark night i drive on
maybe we took this too far

eminem
cause to this day we remain estranged and i hate it though
cause you aint even get to witness your grandbabies grow
but im sorry mama for cleaning out my closet at the time i was angry
rightfully maybe so never meant that far to take it though cause

now i know its not your fault and im not making jokes
that song i no longer play at shows and i cringe every time its on the radio
and i think of nathan being placed in a home and all the medicine you fed us
and how i just wanted you to taste your own but

now the medications taken over and your mental states deteriorating slow
and im way too old to cry that shits painful though
but ma i forgive you so does nathan yo
all you did all you said you did your best to raise us both

foster care that cross you bare few may be as heavy as yours
but i love you debbie mathers oh what a tangled web we have cause
one thing i never asked was where the fuck my deadbeat dad was
fuck it i guess he had trouble keeping up with every address

but idve flipped every mattress every rock and desert cactus
owned a collection of maps and followed my kids to the edge of the atlas
someone ever moved them from me that you could bet your asses
if i had to come down the chimney dressed as santa kidnap em

and although one has only met their grandma
once you pulled up in our drive one night as we were leaving to get some hamburgers
me her and nate we introduced you hugged you
and as you left i had this overwhelming sadness come over me

as we pulled off to go our separate paths and
i saw your headlights as i looked back
and im mad i didnt get the chance to
thank you for being my mom and my dad

so mom please accept this as a tribute i wrote this on the jet
i guess i had to get this off my chest i hope i get the chance to lay it fore im dead
the stewardess said to fasten my seat belt i guess were crashing
so if im not dreaming i hope you this message that i will always love you from afar

cause youre my mama

nate
i guess we are who we are
headlights shining in the dark night i drive on
maybe we took this too far

i want a new life
one without a cause
so im coming home tonight
well no matter what the cost

and if the plane goes down
or if the crew cant wake me up
well just know that im alright
i was not afraid to die

oh even if theres songs to sing
well my children will carry me
just know that im alright
i was not afraid to die

because i put my faith in my new girl
so i never say goodbye cruel world
just know that im alright
i am not afraid to die

i guess we are who we are
headlights shining in the dark night i drive on
maybe we took this too far
i want a new lifeyeah trying to figure out the difference
but i think i think the lines are starting to get blurry

im in a strange place
i feel like mase when he gave up the game for his faith
i feel like im caged in these chains and restraints
grinning every stranger in the place while i gaze into space
cause im mentally rearranging his face
i need a change of pace cause the pace im working at is dangerous
theres nowhere to dump this anger and thanks to this angst
i done quit chicken heads in cold turkey and started slowly roasting em
cause thats where most of my anger is based
fuck your feelings i feel like i play for the saints
i just want to hurt you aim for the skanks
then aim for all these fake kanyes jays waynes and the drakes
im frustrated cause aint no more nsync now im all out of wack
im all out of backstreet boys to call out and attack
im going all out in this rap shit and whatever the fallout is
im strapped for battles suck a duck crawl out the back bar fight
prepare your arsenal and beware of bar stools flying through the air
and bottles breaking mirrors also
and i aint stopping til the swear jars full
you done called every woman a slut but you forgetting sarah marshall
oh my bad slut
and next time i show up in court ill be naked and square a lawsuit
judge be like thats sharp how much that motherfucker cost you
smart ass you lucky i dont tear it off you
and jump your bones you sexy motherfucker
you so fucking gravy marshall i should start calling you au jus
cause all you do is spit them lyrics out the wazoo
evil twin take this beat now its on you
i believe people can change but only for the worse
i couldve changed the world if it wasnt for this verse
so satanic kmart chains panic
cause they cant even spin back the curse words
cause it works when theyre reversed motherfucker

and these kids are like parrots
they run around the house just like terrorists
screaming fuck shit fuck
adult with a child is like arrogance
wild ever since the day i came out i was like merits fuck that
id rather be loud and i like swearing
from the first album even the gals were like tight lyrics dreamy eyes
but my fucking mouth was nightmare-ish
and from the start of it you felt like you were a part of this
and the opposition felt the opposite
sometimes i listen and revisit them old albums
often as i can and skim through all them bitches
to make sure i keep up with my competition
hogger of beats hoarder of rhymes
borderline genius whos bored of his lines
and that sort of defines where im at and the way i feel now
feel like i might just strike first and ignore the replies

this darkness comes in me
evil twin
and comes again

that aint me hes my evil twin
i step out and see my evil twin he gives me an evil grin
hes just a friend who pops up now and again
so dont blame me blame him
my evil twin

my destiny went on the steps i met deshaun at osborn
id never make it to sophomore
i just wanted to skip school and rap used to mop floors
flip burgers and wash dishes but i wrote rhymes trying to get props for em
cause i took book-smarts and swapped for em
they was sleeping i made them stop snorin
made them break out the popcorn
now ive been hip hop in its tip top form
since nwa was blaring through my car windows leaning on the horn
screaming fuck the police like cop porn
flipped rap on its ear like i dropped coin

and that includes biggie and pac whore
and i got an evil twin so who the fuck do you think thats 3rd and that 4th spots for

in a dumb gown black hood
with a scythe
shit i laughed in his face spit
bitch gave me an extra life like take this

bitch dont take shit for granted
and dont take shit give it
only bull you should take is by the horns
a mixture of whitey ford and mighty thor
i everlast pen is mightier than sword
finish writing then record

nothings riding on it but your privates are youre fighting for
so you fight scratch you claw

you grab your balls like theyre gargantuan and
ask yourself how fucking bad you want it
pull out your pants whoop your ass and flash it on em
nobodies gonna back you in the corner
throw a hornet
no ones more ig-norant then you fuckin four in the morning youre at the laboratory storming
like theres nothing thats more important

besides static pain and big daddy kane
break beats and words
an erratic train of thought
like splatter paint
scatter brain
yeah maybe why that explains
why youre back but you dont rap the same
and youre looking way thinner
because your hunger got you looking like
they took away dinner
sugar ray leonard wouldnt sugar coat a fucking booger though
just to wipe that bitch on a hookers coat

rockys back wheres my adrian
nobodies crazy as shady in an eighty million mile radius
im what tom brady is to the patriots of rap
not a man im a weapon
who just happened to be a rapper
who just happen to be on the crapper
when it happened i had an epiphany
in the bathroom id never be the same after
now im back with an apper-tite
for destruction the fucking recipe for disaster
so lets eat cos im famished
every deed is a dastardly one
evil its past it
even you asking for me to be pulled

nobody puts baby in the corner
im only trying to warn ya
cus that baby gets mad
and gets to throwing a tantrum
hell fucking flip on ya

so step inside of dimension
the demented side of a mind
thats like the inside of an engine
while i multiply your undivided attention
but be reminded that if i didnt mention
i lose my mind and my temper
youll be the first one
who finds him offensive
got him climbing the fences
lost some time to addiction
but look up rhyme in the dictio-nary

eminem is the synonym for it
im an enigma
fuck it lets get to the meat balls
im gonna skip the veg and potatoes
edgamacater they are
shit legends are madea
spit treachreous data
shit that you would say to your worst enemy
this wretchedness is
what you get when you mix treach with a jada
and combine em with method man and redman
whit meth-amphetamines in his left hand
and in his right theres a sledge-hammer
and pajamas standing in front of a webcam
beating himself in the head til russell lets him off dead jam
maybe i need my head examined
hannibal lecter with a dead lamb
hanging from his ceiling dripping with a bed pan
i need meds
swear to god cus if i go off the edge
ti aint talking me off a ledge man
heart throb at a fart ah nah
more like a smart slob part blob
thatll stab you with a sharp ob-ject
to the heart and leave claw marks
all over the wal-mart walls
little baby with large balls
fuck mud slinging im blood flinging
theres nothing on this fucking earth better then being
king of the playground
i hate the swings but i love being the underdog
cos when im pushed
i end up swinging upgirl you gimme writers block
im at a loss for words
my minds as lost as yours
i rack my brain but still no thoughts emerge
never seen no ass as large as yours how much that cost
thats what i call a roethlisberger
you drive me bonkers i’m about to get my swerve on for sure
thought i was pimpin until i felt like nas the first date
because i think i gave you power when i gave you flowers
and i bought us a box of chocolates no lozenges or cough drops or syrups
probably should of never let me call that job of yours
to talk to your boss and ask him if you can take off from work
should of been one of the first signs to cause to learn
man we jumped in too fast cause since then i cant be apart from her
cause nobodies bodys awesomer - i lust it and she loves me cause im popular but

you know this aint love
oh no you know this aint love
you know this aint love

its desperation
i cant even put up a fight cause i give in at the sight of her
and here i go again

well obviously oblivious to me i swore i was just invisible to you til i went to the lengths i did to meet you
cause you played so hard to get with me from the beginning
now im in disbelief i never knew that this could be such misery
cause now you see nothin but me and i dont see nothin but you
and im about to flip cause we are super glued in
we stuck to each others hips and we cant do anything individually
which is to cling on scared to be alone cant specifically to describe it i just cant seem to give a reason this definitive just need you
talkin bout i live and breathe you
and you pretend to be as mentally and physically addicted to me
as wiz khalifa is to reefer
dont wanna be without you dont wanna be with you neither bitch
put me in a situation in which its both i wish to seek cause this aint

you know this aint love
oh no you know this aint love
you know this aint love
no this aint love
what is it then its desperation

just want you to myself dont wanna share you with no one else
what the fuck you whispering for you get on my nerves you make me sick
i think our relationship it seems to be on the fritz
i mean its time that we just split and leave the games behind
your frame of mind aint the same as mine i think
you need to finish developing a little more mentally too get the picture
thats a negative alicia i will never give the keys up
to the crib ever again no reason not even a gift certificate from tiffanys
you better have an epiphany slut guess what what delicia

you been using me for loot like i used you for looks
thought you was too good for me huh yeah used to be my carrie underwood i was your lumberjack but i cant stomach this
im leavin you not comin back she said the fuck with that
wheres my louisville slugger at
she grabbed that fuckin bat and swung it at my head
i barely ducked and thats right when she came up with a kick to the nuts twice
steel toe girl probably coulda put a 100 yard field goal through the uprights

you know this aint love
oh no you know this aint love
you know this aint love
no this aint love
what is it then its desperationwhat is a nightmare
the dictionary tells us it is a terrifying dream a nightmare

i used to think i had bad luck but i wasnt superstitious
til one day i grew suspicious when i stepped on a crack
on aunt ednas stoop and got pooped on by a group of stupid pigeons
then we flew the coop to michigan to start a new be-ditching
missouri from michigan didnt work so we moved
back to missouri from michigan from missouri back to michigan
someone put me out my misery i cant do this again
mom please stick to a decision discipline last thing i wanna do
is listen shes like lex luthor bitch and rules are krypton-
-ite so the walls i done lost my power to see through them bitches
but i run into em running through the kitchen
pretending to be blind superman cause i had no supervision
but i did have a super power though i could turn into invisible kid
disappear out of sight like a true magician
then one day uncle ronnie brought over this new but different
music into the picture and it become my new religion

i remember it clearly even today

move back to michigan again to live with my grandma nan
always itching for something to do was flipping
through the radio stations one day and discovered
this dj who was mixing i say it to this day if you aint listened
to the wizard you aint have a fucking clue what you was missing
id zone out with my headphones all i remember doings wishing for shoes
fuck them stupid pumas bitch its all about them new edition troops
you get them ll cool j cooling systems
think i finally maneuvered to 8 mile and hoover
and somehow i saw my future is in this thats how i know my mission
little boom box booming spitting practicing numerous written
when i sit in my room envisioning my dreams come to fruition
i remember proof would visit couldnt wait to play him my new shit
hed go complete ballistic go through the roof for his shit
its like we knew the instant we touched a mic that both of us
two existed to do this shit never quit too persistent

we are the underground empire

started a group of misfits proof had a proposition
if we all band together there aint no stopping this shit
come up with aliases bipolar opposites and
be ready to come off the top as sharp precision
if you got dissed at the shop cause if they caught you slipping
theyd take your spot if someone got to ripping you
and you forgot your written opportunity knocks once it aint knocking again
it tried ding-dong ditching shit i fucking got that bitch
in a headlock cut off his oxygen slim its not cordial
like cocksucking cynderblocks in the wind now i got my pot to piss in
spot in that top position hopping over that opposition
looking like a dog is pissing leg up on the competition
promising complete dominance sugar ray robinson
im in a league muhammads in alis my colleague bombing em
probably end up on top of em like stomping em like ndamukong
im russian like a ukrainian ladainian tomlinson
flow vomits in your face competitors fall at my waist
you spit a rhyme i spit in a rhymes face
so name the time place to battle bitch im still in that mind state
dont make me step on you and make you wine grapes
cry babies maybe my way that i use words is loose
but you turds better be careful how you choose yours
cause feelings scar but egos bruise worse
and the truth hurts shit no wonder youre sore losers
now wheres your bluebirds ooh
no more tripping in bird shit this songs a self empowerment surgeon
words of encouragement but this discouraging
the rap games god but the names not james todd im just a wordsmith
so let these words lift cause all i got is bars
for you dumbbells and doors aint working out
each verse is more merciless than the first and you aint got to wear
no shoes and shirt in this bitch to get served bloodthirst revenge of a nerds

they will not escape my vengeance

and im the kid with them ears like dumbos gone
with the uncle ron im turning into an unhumble don
you blind dumb hoes all i got is dick for you to come blow on
so stop the show but i need a drum roll fore i go on
better back away from the front row get launched up your arm
bigger than dikembe mutumbo on the fucking jumbotron
im a juggernaut you do not wanna crumble you bambacluts
ill leave you stretched out like a fucking yarn
so mow the fucking lawn your asses are blades of grass
and im fucking up this whole landscape of rap
the goat just ate eight acres and ate the vet
who just make a path and take you straight to your favorite rapper
oh look my notebook with smoke cook
like the flow stood a foot over the flame on the stove
soot charred debris floating like oakwood
was burning return of the no good and i wont quit

and the next thing i know something came crawling up from below
something that made godzilla look like a plane

and i dont quit wont change its like a groundhogs day
so crowd around yall cause you may so you cant pop your head

im not so sure i want to know from once it came
but the white flesh creatures trail is easily followed
there before that shimmering veil of light the ivory skin slug thingi can feel the heat rising
everything is on fire
todays a painful reminder of why
we can only get brighter
the further you put it behind ya
and right now im on the inside
lookin out cause

i found her in the flames
theres a beautiful kind of pain
setting fire to yesterday
find the light find the light find the light

i found her in the flames
theres a beautiful kind of pain
setting fire to yesterday
find the light find the light find the light

yesterday was the tornado warning today is like the morning after
your world is torn in half you wake and lets wait to start the morning process
rebuilding and youre still a work in progress
today is a whole new chapter its like an enormous ass
the thunderstorm has passed ya your weather didnt poke his eyes out with the thorn bush that you
used to smell the roses stopped to inhale cant even tell your nose is stuffed
so focused on the brightside then you floor the gas pedal and hit the corner fast the more asserted never looking back may hit the curb but everyday is a new learning curve as you steer through life sometimes you might not wanna swerve but you have to to avert a disaster lucky no permanent damage cause they hurt you so bad its like they murdered your ass and threw dirt on your casket but you returned from the ashes and that hurt that you have you just converted to gasoline and while youre burning the past standing at inferno and chant

i found her in the flames
theres a beautiful kind of pain
setting fire to yesterday
find the light find the light find the light

i found her in the flames
theres a beautiful kind of pain
setting fire to yesterday
find the light find the light find the light

so familiarize what having to swallow this pill is like
it happens all the time they take your heart and steal your life
and its as though you feel youve died because youve been killed inside
but yet youre still alive which means you must survive
although today you may weep because youre weak and
everything seems so bleek and hopeless
the light that youre seeking it begins to seep in
thats the only thing keeping you from leaping off the motherfreaking deep end
and im pulling for you to push through this feeling
and with a little time that should do the healing
and by tomorrow you may even feel so good that youre willing
to forgive them even after all that shit you been put through
this feeling of resilience is building and the flames are burning
quick as fire would through this building youre sealed in
but youre fireproof and flame retardant you withstood it
and as you climb up to the roof youre just chillin and you look down
cause youre so over them you could put the heel of your foot through the ceiling

as time passes things change everyday
but wounds wounds heal
but scars still remaining the same
but tomorrow todays gone down in flames
throw the match at the past up place

so feel the fire beneath your feet
as you barely even perspire from the heat
exhale deep and breathe a sigh of relief
and as you say goodbye to the grief
its like watching the walls melt in your prison cell
but youve extinguished this living hell
still a little piece of you dies you scream

i found her in the flames
theres a beautiful kind of pain
setting fire to yesterday
find the light find the light find the light

i found her in the flames
theres a beautiful kind of pain
setting fire to yesterday
find the light find the light find the light

feel the burn watch the smoke as i turn
rising a phoenix from the flames
flame of love were going to fight the word fight
now it feels with these wings that i will fly

i found her in the flames
theres a beautiful kind of pain
setting fire to yesterday
find the light find the light find the light

i found her in the flames
theres a beautiful kind of pain
setting fire to yesterday
find the light find the light find the lightim getting by with my wicked ways
im loading up and im taking names
i wanna dig my way to hell
i wanna dig my way to hell

guess i got a way with words i could get away with murder
ever heard of aspergers its a rare condition
its what youre suffering from when you simply dont care if its an
80 degree day and theres no fricken air conditioning
and you cant see the bitch’s hair is frizzing
cause you got the windows up blaring the system in your chevrolet prism
the devil aint on the level same as him
picture someone who revels in straight masochism
and imagine him giving him an adjective an ass whooping
so bad they should put his ass in prison
a word bully i verbally abuse verbs like they did something to me personally
used to get bullied so i cut class and ditched it
now i bully rap im the shit faggot sniff it
cadillac from a k car
my ass from a hole in the ground still can’t tell em apart
came straight out the trailer park screaming im proud
to shop at k-mart and it became art
and im still fed up and as pissed off as they are
to this day i still get in fights with the same broad
at the same walmart arguing over the same cart
in the middle of the aisle whilin i dont give a fuck i dont play
bitch you think you saw this basket first
your ass backwards like motherfucking bob and silent jay
illest shit you could think i would say
minds like a pile of clay
whens the last time you saw a villain with a cape
ripped a gaping hole in it
flipped out ripped down the drapes
tied them around my neck went down the fire escape of the empire state
slipped fell straight down to the ground splattered all over the entire state
and straight to hell got an impaled by the gates
so satan stuck his face in an ashtray
while i sacheted around flames with a match and i gave him the gas face gibberish
and this aint got nothing to do with a scale of being gay ya
little faggot by the way thoughts are getting darker by the day
im a combination of skylar grey tyler the creator and violent jay
its a fucking miracle to be this lyrical
paint my face with clown make up and a smiley face im insane
every rhyme i say sons you like an ultra violet ray
i’m selling hatred buffet style all the shit you can eat
$1199 so come on and pile a plate
i’m throwin down the gauntlet to see what hell i can raise
with the rhyme i’m spittin while i’m shittin on the competition
in the meantime it’s always mean time

im getting by with my wicked ways
im loading up and im taking names

i wanna dig my way to hell

i’ve been a career asshole

but im leaving on this jet plane
you aint fly youre an airhead
im sick of pounding a square peg in a round hole sorry another catchphrase
but your baggage aint gonna fit in my storage over headspace
cause you just aint big enough to fit your damaged goods
other words dont try to put the heart in a headcase
cause baby stable mentally i aint i need my meds i peed my bed
im going blind i dont see my legs i keep on falling down
no wonder you cant stand me i need my cane
someone help me i think my face is melting
if you felt these migraines and see these maggots eat my brain

and im the definition of what a concrete chin is

and knock me to the canvas even the boxing critics

but i hope i offended you when i told ya how dope i am at this
and put emphasis on the dope so when names come up
in that conversation of whos the dopest better throw mine in it
and dont mind me while i remind you of the flow
you wont find anywhere where it fires and i unload my pen explodes
til theres no rhymes in it reload in no time
let insults fly even sixty seconds that go by so you know i meant it
in school i was so shy timid
two pairs of jeans id alternate bummy clothes i member
begging my mom for k-mart macgregors cause they were new
st vincent de paul those ponys were used and no size fitted
