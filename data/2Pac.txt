verse one

young black male
i try to effect by kicking the facts
and stacking much mail
im packing a gat cuz guys wanna jack
and fuck goin to jail
cuz i aint equipped to stop how i look
i dont sell ya-yo
they teachin a brother like i was in books
follow me into a flow
im sure you know which way to go
im hittin em out of the dopes
so slip on the slope lets skip on the flow
im fuckin the sluts and hoes
the bigger the butts the tighter the clothes
the gimminy jimminy grows
then whaddya know its off with some clothes
rowd when the crowd says hoe
that lets me know they know i can flow
love when they come to my shows
i get up and go with skins before
when im collecting my dough
i never respect the one that i back
the quicker the nigga can rap
the bigger the check now watch how they sweat
what kind of style is that
the style of a mack and ready to jack
i rendered up piles of black
the wacker the pack the fatter the smack
i hate it when real nigga bust
they hate when i cuss they threaten to bust
i had enough of the fuss
i bust what i bust and cuss when i must
they gave me a charge for sales
for selling the tales of young black males

yes nigga n-i-g-g-a niggaz

fuck you capo  you aint in baby

i tell you what  you guys are not gonna be talking
all that shit when i come back ok
we gonna say who the big mouth when i come back

young black maleyou know they got me trapped in this prison of seclusion
happiness living on tha streets is a delusion
even a smooth criminal one day must get caught
shot up or shot down with tha bullet that he bought
nine millimeter kickin thinking about what tha streets do to me
cause they never talk peace in tha black community
all we know is violence do tha job in silence
walk tha city streets like a rat pack of tyrants
too many brothers daily heading for tha big penn
niggas commin out worse off than when they went in
over tha years i done alot of growin up
getten drunk thrown up
cuffed up
then i said i had enough
there must be another route way out
to money and fame i changed my name
and played a different game
tired of being trapped in this vicious cycle
if one more cop harrasses me i just might go psycho
and when i gettem
ill hittem with tha bum rush
only a lunatic would like to see his skull crushed
yo if your smart youll really let me go g
but keep me cooped up in this ghetto and catch tha uzi
they got me trapped

chorus
uh uh they cant keep tha black man down
they got me trapped
naw they cant keep tha black man down
trapped
uh uh they cant keep tha black man down
trapped
naw they cant keep tha black man down

they got me trapped
can barely walk tha city streets
without a cop harrassing me searching me
then asking my identity
hands up throw me up against tha wall
didnt do a thing at all
im tellen you one day these suckers gotta fall
cuffed up throw me on tha concrete
coppers try to kill me
but they didnt know this was tha wrong street
bang bang down another casualty
but its a cop whos shot theres brutality
who do you blame
its a shame because tha mans slain
he got caught in tha chains of his own game
how can i feel guilty after all tha things they did to me
sweated me hunted me
trapped in my own community
one day im gonna bust
blow up on this society
why did ya lie to me 
i couldnt find a trace of equality
work me like a slave while they laid back
homie dont play that
its time i lettem suffer tha payback
im tryin to avoid physical contact
i cant hold back its time to attack jack
they got me trapped

chorus
uh uh they cant keep tha black man down
you know they got me trapped
naw they cant keep tha black man down
trapped
uh uh they cant keep tha black man down
you know they got me trapped
naw they cant keep tha black man down

now im trapped and want to find a getaway
all i need is a g and somewhere safe to stay
cant use tha phone
cause im sure someone is tappin in
did it before
aint scared to use my gat again
i look back at hindsite the fight was irrelevant
but now hes tha devils friend
too late to be tellin him
he shot first and ill be damned if i run away
homie is done away i should of put my gun away
i wasnt thinkin all i heard was tha ridicule
girlies was laughin tup sayin damn homies is dissin you
i fired my weapon
started steppin in tha hurricane
i got shot so i dropped
feelin a burst of pain
got to my feet
couldnt see nothin but bloody blood
now im a fugitive to be hunted like a murderer
ran through an alley
still lookin for my getaway
coppers said freeze or youll be dead today
trapped in a corner
dark and i couldnt see tha light
thoughts in my mind was tha nine and a better life
what do i do 
live my life in a prison cell
id rather die than be trapped in a living hell
they got me trapped

chorus
uh uh they cant keep tha black man down
they got me trapped
naw they cant keep tha black man down
trapped
uh uh they cant keep tha black man down
you know they got me trapped
naw they cant keep tha black man down
trappedtupac talking

in one way or another
american will find a way to eliminate the problem
one by one
the problem is
the troubles in the black youth of the ghettos
and one by one
we are being wiped off the face of this earth
at an extremly alarming rate
and even more alarming is the fact
that we are not fighting back
brothers sistas niggas
when i say niggas it is not the nigga we are grown to fear
it is not the nigga we say as if it has no meaning
but to me
it means never ignorant getting goals acomplishes nigga
niggas what are we going to do
walk blind into a line or fight
fight and die if we must like niggas

this is for the masses the lower classes
the ones you left out jobs were givin better livin
but we were kept out
made to feel inferior but were the superior
break the chains in our brains that made us fear yah
pledge allegiance to a flag that neglects us
honour a man that who refuses to respect us
emancipation proclamation please
lincoln just said that to save the nation
these are lies that we all accepted
say no to drugs but the governments keep it
running through our community killing the unity
the war on drugs is a war on you and me
and yet they say this is the home of the free
but if you ask me its all about hyprocracy
the constitution yo it dont apply to me
lady liberty still the bitch lied to me
steady strong nobodys gonna like what i pumpin
but its wrong to keeping someone from learning something
so get up its time to start nation building
im fed up we gotta start teaching childern
that they can be all that they wanna to be
theres much more to life than just poverty

this is defaintly ahhh words of wisdom
amerika amerika amerikkka
i charge you with the crime of rape murder and assault
for suppressing and punishing my people
i charge you with robery for robbing me of my history
i charge you with false imprisonment for keeping me
trapped in the projects
and the jury finds you guilty on all accounts
and you are to serve the consequences of your evil schemes
prosecutor do you have any more evidience

words of wisdom
they shine upon the strength of an nation
conquer the enemy on with education
protect thy self reach with what you wanna do
know thy self teach what we been through
on with the knowledge of the place then
no one will ever oppress this race again
no malcolm x in my history text
why is that
cause he tried to educate and liberate all blacks
why is martin luther king in my book each week
he told blacks if they get smacked turn the other cheek
i dont get it so many questions went through my mind
i get sweated they act as if asking questions is a crime
but forget it one day im gonna prove them wrong
now every brother had to smother on the welfare line
the american dream though it seems it attainable
theyre pulling your sleave dont believe
cause it will strangle yah
pulling the life of your brain i cant explain
beg as you can obtain from which you came
swear that your mother is living in equality
forgeting your brother thats living her apology
thought they had us beat when they took our kids
but the battle aint over till the black man sings
words of wisdom
but the battle aint over till the black man sings

i am what you made me
the hate and evil that you gave me

ever since you was a pee-wee down by my knee with a wee-wee
we been coochie-coo all through school you and me g
back in the days we played practical jokes on
everybody smoked with they locs and the yolks on
all through high school girls by the dozens
sayin we cousins knowin that we wasnt
but like the old saying goes
times goes on and everybody grows
grew apart had to part went our own ways
you chose the dope gaaaane my microphone pays
in many ways we were paid in the old days
so far away from the crazies with aks
and though i been around clowning with the underground
im still down with my homies from the hometown
and if you need need anything at all
i drop it all for yall if my homies call

verse two

its a shame you chose the dope game
now you slang cane on the streets with no name
it was plain that your aim was mo cane
you got game now you run with no shame
i chose rappin tracks to make stacks
in fact i travel the map with raps that spray cats
but now i dont wanna down my homie
no matter how low you go youre not lowly
and i hear that you made a few enemies
but when you need a friend you can depend on me call
if you need my assistance therell be no resistance
ill be there in an instant
who am i to judge another brother only on his cover
id be no different than the other
h-to-the-o-to-the-m-to-the-i-to-the-e
im down to the e-n-d
cause its a fall in no time at all
im down for yall when my homies call
word if my homies call

verse three

well its ninety-one and im livin kinda swell now
but i hear that youre going through some hell pal
but life makin records aint easy
it aint what i expected its hectic its sleazy
but i guess that the streets is harder
trying to survive in the life of a young godfather
my homies is making it elsewhere
striving working nine to five with no health care
we both had dreams of being great
but his deferred and blurred and changed in shaped
its fate it wasnt my choice to make
to be great im giving it all it takes
trying to shake the crates and fakes and snakes
i gotta take my place or fall from grace
the foolish way the pace is quick and great
smiling face to hide the trace of hate
but my homie would never do me wrong
thats why i wrote this song if you ever need me its on
no matter who the foe they must fall
us against them all im down to brawl if my homies callbrendas got a baby
brendas got a baby

i hear brendas got a baby
but brendas barely got a brain
a damn shame
the girl can hardly spell her name
thats not our problem thats up ta brendas family
well let me show ya how it affects tha whole community
now brenda never really knew her moms 
and her dad was a junky
went in debt to his arms its sad
cause i bet brenda doesnt even know
just cause your in tha ghetto doesnt mean ya cant grow
but oh thats a thought my own revelation
do whatever it takes ta resist tha temptation
brenda got herself a boyfriend
her boyfriend was her cousin now lets watch tha joy end
she tried to hide her pregnancy from her family
who didnt really care to see or give a damn if she

young black maleyou know they got me trapped in this prison of seclusion
happiness living on tha streets is a delusion
even a smooth criminal one day must get caught
shot up or shot down with tha bullet that he bought
nine millimeter kickin thinking about what tha streets do to me
cause they never talk peace in tha black community
all we know is violence do tha job in silence
walk tha city streets like a rat pack of tyrants
too many brothers daily heading for tha big penn
niggas commin out worse off than when they went in
over tha years i done alot of growin up
getten drunk thrown up
cuffed up
then i said i had enough
there must be another route way out
to money and fame i changed my name
and played a different game
tired of being trapped in this vicious cycle
if one more cop harrasses me i just might go psycho
and when i gettem
ill hittem with tha bum rush
only a lunatic would like to see his skull crushed
yo if your smart youll really let me go g
but keep me cooped up in this ghetto and catch tha uzi
they got me trapped

chorus
uh uh they cant keep tha black man down
they got me trapped
naw they cant keep tha black man down

they got me trapped
can barely walk tha city streets
without a cop harrassing me searching me
then asking my identity
hands up throw me up against tha wall
didnt do a thing at all
im tellen you one day these suckers gotta fall
cuffed up throw me on tha concrete
coppers try to kill me
but they didnt know this was tha wrong street
bang bang down another casualty
but its a cop whos shot theres brutality
who do you blame
its a shame because tha mans slain
he got caught in tha chains of his own game
how can i feel guilty after all tha things they did to me
sweated me hunted me
trapped in my own community
one day im gonna bust
blow up on this society
why did ya lie to me 
i couldnt find a trace of equality
work me like a slave while they laid back
homie dont play that
its time i lettem suffer tha payback
im tryin to avoid physical contact
i cant hold back its time to attack jack
they got me trapped

chorus
uh uh they cant keep tha black man down
you know they got me trapped
naw they cant keep tha black man down
trapped
uh uh they cant keep tha black man down
you know they got me trapped
naw they cant keep tha black man down

now im trapped and want to find a getaway
all i need is a g and somewhere safe to stay
cant use tha phone
cause im sure someone is tappin in
did it before
aint scared to use my gat again
i look back at hindsite the fight was irrelevant
but now hes tha devils friend
too late to be tellin him
he shot first and ill be damned if i run away
homie is done away i should of put my gun away
i wasnt thinkin all i heard was tha ridicule
girlies was laughin tup sayin damn homies is dissin you
i fired my weapon
started steppin in tha hurricane
i got shot so i dropped
feelin a burst of pain
got to my feet
couldnt see nothin but bloody blood
now im a fugitive to be hunted like a murderer
ran through an alley
still lookin for my getaway
coppers said freeze or youll be dead today
trapped in a corner
dark and i couldnt see tha light
thoughts in my mind was tha nine and a better life
what do i do 
live my life in a prison cell
id rather die than be trapped in a living hell
they got me trapped

chorus
uh uh they cant keep tha black man down

but to me
it means never ignorant getting goals acomplishes nigga
niggas what are we going to do
walk blind into a line or fight
fight and die if we must like niggas

this is for the masses the lower classes
the ones you left out jobs were givin better livin
but we were kept out
made to feel inferior but were the superior
break the chains in our brains that made us fear yah
pledge allegiance to a flag that neglects us
honour a man that who refuses to respect us
emancipation proclamation please
lincoln just said that to save the nation
these are lies that we all accepted
say no to drugs but the governments keep it
running through our community killing the unity
the war on drugs is a war on you and me
and yet they say this is the home of the free
but if you ask me its all about hyprocracy
the constitution yo it dont apply to me
lady liberty still the bitch lied to me
steady strong nobodys gonna like what i pumpin
but its wrong to keeping someone from learning something
so get up its time to start nation building
im fed up we gotta start teaching childern
that they can be all that they wanna to be
theres much more to life than just poverty

this is defaintly ahhh words of wisdom
amerika amerika amerikkka
i charge you with the crime of rape murder and assault
for suppressing and punishing my people
i charge you with robery for robbing me of my history
i charge you with false imprisonment for keeping me
trapped in the projects
and the jury finds you guilty on all accounts
and you are to serve the consequences of your evil schemes
prosecutor do you have any more evidience

words of wisdom
they shine upon the strength of an nation
conquer the enemy on with education
protect thy self reach with what you wanna do
know thy self teach what we been through
on with the knowledge of the place then
no one will ever oppress this race again
no malcolm x in my history text
why is that
cause he tried to educate and liberate all blacks
why is martin luther king in my book each week
he told blacks if they get smacked turn the other cheek
i dont get it so many questions went through my mind
i get sweated they act as if asking questions is a crime
but forget it one day im gonna prove them wrong
now every brother had to smother on the welfare line
the american dream though it seems it attainable
theyre pulling your sleave dont believe
cause it will strangle yah
pulling the life of your brain i cant explain
beg as you can obtain from which you came
swear that your mother is living in equality
forgeting your brother thats living her apology
thought they had us beat when they took our kids
but the battle aint over till the black man sings
words of wisdom
but the battle aint over till the black man sings

nightmare thats what i am
americas nightmare
i am what you made me
the hate and evil that you gave me
i shine of a reminder of what you have done to my people

ever since you was a pee-wee down by my knee with a wee-wee
we been coochie-coo all through school you and me g
back in the days we played practical jokes on
everybody smoked with they locs and the yolks on
all through high school girls by the dozens
sayin we cousins knowin that we wasnt
but like the old saying goes
times goes on and everybody grows
grew apart had to part went our own ways
you chose the dope gaaaane my microphone pays
in many ways we were paid in the old days
so far away from the crazies with aks
and though i been around clowning with the underground
im still down with my homies from the hometown
and if you need need anything at all
i drop it all for yall if my homies call

verse two

its a shame you chose the dope game
now you slang cane on the streets with no name
it was plain that your aim was mo cane
you got game now you run with no shame
i chose rappin tracks to make stacks
in fact i travel the map with raps that spray cats
but now i dont wanna down my homie
no matter how low you go youre not lowly
and i hear that you made a few enemies
but when you need a friend you can depend on me call
if you need my assistance therell be no resistance
ill be there in an instant
who am i to judge another brother only on his cover
id be no different than the other
h-to-the-o-to-the-m-to-the-i-to-the-e
im down to the e-n-d
cause its a fall in no time at all
im down for yall when my homies call
word if my homies call

verse three

well its ninety-one and im livin kinda swell now
but i hear that youre going through some hell pal
but life makin records aint easy
it aint what i expected its hectic its sleazy
but i guess that the streets is harder
trying to survive in the life of a young godfather
my homies is making it elsewhere
striving working nine to five with no health care
we both had dreams of being great
but his deferred and blurred and changed in shaped
its fate it wasnt my choice to make
to be great im giving it all it takes
trying to shake the crates and fakes and snakes
i gotta take my place or fall from grace
the foolish way the pace is quick and great
smiling face to hide the trace of hate
but my homie would never do me wrong
thats why i wrote this song if you ever need me its on
no matter who the foe they must fall
us against them all im down to brawl if my homies callbrendas got a baby
brendas got a baby

i hear brendas got a baby
but brendas barely got a brain
a damn shame
the girl can hardly spell her name
thats not our problem thats up ta brendas family
well let me show ya how it affects tha whole community
now brenda never really knew her moms 
and her dad was a junky
went in debt to his arms its sad
cause i bet brenda doesnt even know
just cause your in tha ghetto doesnt mean ya cant grow
but oh thats a thought my own revelation
do whatever it takes ta resist tha temptation
brenda got herself a boyfriend
her boyfriend was her cousin now lets watch tha joy end
she tried to hide her pregnancy from her family
who didnt really care to see or give a damn if she
went out and had a church of kids
as long as when tha check came they got first dibs
now brendas bellys gettin bigger
but no one seems ta notice any change in her figure
shes 12 years old and shes having a baby
in love with tha molester whos sexin her crazy
and yet through all she thinks that hell be with her forever
and dreams of a world with tha two of them are together
whatever
he left her and she had tha baby solo she had it on tha
bathroom floor
and didnt know so she didnt know what ta throw away and
what ta keep
she wrapped tha baby up and threw him in tha trash heep
i guess she thought shed get away
wouldnt hear tha cries
she didnt realize
how much tha little baby had her eyes
now tha babys in tha trash heep balling
momma cant help her but it hurts ta hear her calling
brenda wants ta run away
momma say you makin me lose pay and social workers here
everyday
now brendas gotta make her own way
cant go to her family they wont let her stay
no money no babysitter she couldnt keep a job
she tried ta sell crack but end up getting robbed
so now whats next there aint nothin left ta sell
so she sees sex as a way of leavin hell
its payin tha rent so she really cant complain
prostitute found slain and brendas her name shes got a
baby

so they all know me the lyrical lunatic the maniac mc
i give a shout out to your homies
maybe then the criticsll leave your boy alone g
on the streets or on tv it just dont pay the be a truth tellin mc
they wont be happy till im banned

east side brothers dont hear me though
theyd rather get shit twisted and gather like hoes
bitch make ass niggas when i caught em
couldnt bust a drape if they wanted
theyre soft like charmin 
but i dont sweat varmits
i suffer with my black group 
just a one-day murderer

my enemies scatter in suicidal situations
never to witness the wicked shit that they was facing
pockets is packed with presidents pursue your riches
evading the player hating tricks while hitting switches
bitches is bad-mouth cause brawling motherfuckers is bold
but yall some hoes the game should be sewed
im sick of psychotic society somebody save me
addicted to drama so even mama couldnt raise me
even the preacher and all my teachers couldnt reach me
i run in the streets and puffin weed wit my peeps
im ducking the cop i hit the weed as im clutching my glock
niggas is hot when i hit the block what if i die tonight

[chorus]
if i die tonight
if i die tonight
if i die tonight
tonights the night i get in some shit

polishing pistols prepare for battle pass the pump
when i get to popping niggas is dropping then they done
calling the coroner come collect the fucking corpse
he got it by killer preoccupied with being boss
revenge is the method whenever stepping keep a weapon close
adversaries are overdosed over deadly notes
jealous niggas and broke bitches equal packed jails
hit the block and fill your pockets making crack sales
picture perfection pursuing paper with a passion
visions of prisons for all the pussies that i blasted
running with criminals individuals with no remorse
try to stop me my pistol posses using deadly force
in my brain all i can think about is fame
the police know my name a different game aint a thing changed
im seeing cemetery photos of my peers
conversatin like they still here if i die tonight

[chorus]

pussy and paper is poetry power and pistols
plotting on murdering motherfuckers fore they get you
pray to the heavens three-fifty-sevens to the sky
and i hope im forgiven for thug living when i die
i wonder if heaven got a ghetto for thug niggas
a stress free life and a spot for drug dealers
pissing while practicing how to pimp and be a player
overdose of a dick while drinking liquor when i lay her
pistol whipping these simps for being petrified and lame
disrespecting the game praying for punishment and pain
going insane never die live eternal who shall i fear
dont shed a tear for me nigga i aint happy here
i hope they bury me and send me to my rest
headlines reading murdered to death my last breath
take a look picture a crook on his last stand
motherfuckers dont understand if i die tonight

[chorus]

without feelin but will they last or be blasted
hard headed bastard

more bodies being buried -- im losing my homies in a hurry
theyre relocating to the cemetary
got me worried stressin my visions blurried
the question is will i live  no one in the world loves me
im headed for danger dont trust strangers
put one in the chamber whenever im feelin this anger

verse three 2pac

with all this extra stressin
the question i wonder is after death after my last breath
when will i finally get to rest  through this supression
they punish the people thats askin questions
and those that possess steal from the ones without possesions
the message i stress to make it stop study your lessons
dont settle for less - even the genius asks-es questions
be grateful for blessings
dont ever change keep your essence
the power is in the people and politics we address
always do your best dont let the pressure make you panic
and when you get stranded
and things dont go the way you planned it
dreamin of riches in a position of makin a difference
politicians and hypocrites they dont wanna listen
if im insane its the fame made a brother change
it wasnt nuttin like the game
its just me against the world

girl	me against the world
2pac	nuttin to lose
	its just me against the world baby
girl	me against the world
2pac	got me stuck in the game
	its just me against the world
girl	oahahhhh
2pac	id be ashamed to lose
	its just me against the world baby
girl	me against the world

outro 2pac

chorus

now that im strugglin in this business
by any means label me greedy gettin green
but seldom seen
and fuck tha world cuz im cursed
im havin visions of leaven here in a hurse
god can ya feel me
take me away from all tha pressure and all tha pain
show me some happiness again

i know my destiny is hell where did i fail 
my life is in denial
and when i die babtised in eternal fire
shed so many tears

chorus

lord
i suffer through tha years
and shed so many tears
lord
i lost so many peers and shed so many tears

now im lost and im weary
so many tears im suicidal so dont stand near me
my every move is a compilated step
ta bring me closer
to embrace an early death now theres nothing left
there was no mercy on tha streets
i couldnt rest
im barely standing bout to go to pieces screaming peace
and though my soul was deleted i couldnt see it
i had my mind full of demons tryin ta break free
they planted seeds and they hatched sparking tha flame
inside my brain like a match such a dirty game
no memories just misery
painting a picture of my enemies killing me in my sleep
will i survive till tha morning ta see tha sun
please lord forgive me for my sins
cause here i come

chorus

lord
i suffer through tha years
and shed so many tears
god
i lost so many peers and

lord knows ive tried been a witness ta homicide
drive-bys taken lives little kids die

broken hearted as i glance at tha chaulk line gettin high
this aint tha life for me
i wanna change
but aint no future right for me
im stuck in tha game
im trapped inside a maze
see this tangaray influenced me ta gettin crazy
disillusioned lately
ive been really wanting babies
so i could see a part of me that wasnt always shady
dont trust my lady
cause shes a product of this poison im hearen noises

im fallin to tha floor
beggin for tha lord ta let me in heavens door

and all other lil young niggaz thats in a rush to be gangstas

as a young nigga im almost swellin in the wind
give anythang to be that innocent again when i was ten
i didnt bang but i was hangin with the homies
tell them niggaz started slangin that they dont know me
i got my hustle on learned to ignore what couldnt pay me
lately ive been tryin to make a bill-ion can you play me
with that jealousy they need to miss me dont sweat me
if them cowards really want me come get me and even i
someday will die but im cautious im fin to ride
put down the top now we flossin
hit the freeway let the wind blow drop the window
workin with a twenty sack of indo feelin good
stop through the hood grab the young thugs
and i cant help but reminisce back when we slung drugs know its bad
but all we had was our hopes and dreams
couldnt see unless we learned to slang dope to fiends
as young niggaz

hes the kind of g like everybody knows
as a young nigga
hes always gd up from head to toe
my memories as a young nigga
always got it blown like al capone
young nigga
hes the downest g ive ever known

back in junior high when we was barely gettin by when daddy died
thats when my momma started gettin high
my neighborhood was full of drivebys couldnt survive
all our homies livin short lives i couldnt cry
told my momma if i did die just put a blunt in my casket
let me get my dead homies high
come follow me throughout my history its just
me against the world stuck in misery; as a young nigga
my only thing was to be paid
life full of riches avoid snitched cause they shady back in the days
we always found the time to play
but thats before they taught them gangbangers how to spray
not just la but in the bay and in chicago and even st louis
every stadium that i go when will they change
stuck in the game like a dumb nigga
remember how it was to be a young nigga

hes the kind of g like everybody knows
as a young nigga
hes always gd up from head to toe
my memories as a young nigga
always got it blown like al capone
young nigga
hes the downest g ive ever known

im tellin you

now that im grown i got my mind on bein somethin
dont wanna be another statistic out here doin nuttin
tryin to maintain in this dirty game keep it real
and i will even if it kills me my young niggaz
break away from these dumb niggaz
put down the guns and have some fun nigga the restll come nigga
fame is a fast thang that gangbangin
puttin niggaz in a casket murdered for hangin
at the wrong place at the wrong time no longer livin
cause he threw up the wrong sign and every day
i watch the murder rate increases and even worse
the epidemic and diseases what is the future
the projects lookin hopeless where
more and more brothers givin up and dont care
sometimes i hate when brothers act up i hit the weed
and i proceed to blow the track up for young niggaz

hes the kind of g like everybody knows
for these young niggaz
hes always gd up from head to toe
my memories as a young nigga
he always got it blown like al capone
take it slow nigga its for the young niggaz
hes the downest g ive ever known
as a young nigga

hes the kind of g like everybody knows
hes always gd up from head to toe

when i was young me and my mama had beef
17 years old kicked out on the streets
though back at the time i never thought id see her face
aint a woman alive that could take my mamas place
suspended from school scared to go home
i was a fool with the big boys breakin all the rules
shed tears with my baby sister
over the years we was poorer than the other little kids
and even though we had different daddies
the same drama when things went wrong we blamed mama
i reminisce on the stress i caused it was hell
huggin on my mama from a jail cell
and whod think in elementary hey id see the penitentiary
one day runnin from the police thats right
mama catch me put a whoopin to my backside
and even as a crack fiend mama 
you always was a black queen mama 
i finally understand for a woman it aint easy tryin to raise a man
you always was committed a poor single mother on welfare
tell me how you did it theres no way i can pay you back
but the plan is to show you that i understand

you are appreciated

lady dont ya know we love ya dear mama
sweet lady place no one above ya you are appreciated
sweet lady dont ya know we love ya

now aint nobody tell us it was fair
no love for my daddy cause the coward wasnt there
he passed away and i didnt cry
cause my anger wouldnt let me feel for a stranger
they say im wrong and im heartless
but all along i was lookin for a father he was gone
i hung around with the thugs and even though they sold drugs
they showed a young brother love
i moved out and started really hangin 
i needed money of my own so i started slangin
i aint guilty cause even though i sell rocks
it feels good puttin money in your mailbox
i love payin rent when the rents due
i hope you got the diamond necklace that i sent to you
cause when i was low you was there for me
you never left me alone because you cared for me
and i can see you comin home after work late
your in the kitchen tryin to fix us a hot plate
just workin with the scraps you was given
and mama made miracles every thanksgiving
but now the road got rough your alone
tryin to raise 2 bad kids on your own
and theres no way i can pay you back
but my plan is to show you that i understand

you are appreciated

lady dont ya know we love ya and dear mama
sweet lady place no one above ya you are appreciated
sweet lady dont ya know we love ya

pour out some liquor and i reminisce
cause through the drama i can always depend on my mama
and when it seems that im hopeless
you say the words that can get me back in focus
when i was sick as a little kid
to keep me happy theres no limit to the things you did
and all my childhood memories
are full of all the sweet things you did for me
and even though i act crazy
i got to thank the lord that you made me
there are no words that can express how i feel
you never kept a secret always stayed real
and i appreciate how you raised me
and all the extra love that you gave me
i wish i could take the pain away
if you can make it through the night theres a brighter day
everything will be alright if you hold on
its a struggle everyday gotta roll on
and theres no way i can pay you back
but my plan is to show you that i understand

you are appreciated

lady dont ya know we love ya dear mama
sweet lady place no one above ya you are appreciated
sweet lady dont ya know we love ya dear mama

sweet lady lady lady ladykeepin it real

i can see youre cautious and im careful not to scare you
but anticipation of love makin 
got you shakin when im standin near you
news of precision will prepare ya
in case you get scared just ask the man in the mirror
now the pictures getten clearer all he does is hit you hard
i tell you to leave and you tell me keep my faith in god

wanna take you there but you scared to follow come see tomorrow
hoping i can take you through the pain and sorrow

you find an mc like me whos strong
leavin motherfuckers aborted with no verbal support
and when i command the microphone i gets deadly as kahn though
with a bear and a snake and a panda im on those 
who can withstand the mo power i gain
and make it possible for me to drop a few to wreck ya brain
imagine and keep on wishin upon a star
finally realizing who the fuck we are
when i penetrate its been withstandin faded
would it be the greatest mc of all time
when i created rhyme for the simple fact
when i attack i crush your pride
my intention to ride every time all night
im faced with the scars beyond this one bar
for me to put down my guard im faced witha mirage
breakin in gas with the six-eight all day
in and out with my pay
im soon to count the bodies

verse two tupac

so mandatory my elevation my lyrics like orientation
so you can be more familiar with tha nigga you facin
we must be based on nothin better than communication
known to damage and highly flamable like gas stations
sorry i left that ass waitin
no more procrastination give up to fate and get that ass shakin
im bustin and makin motherfuckers panic
dont take ya life for granted put that ass in the dirt
you swear the bitches planned it
my lyrics motivate the planet
its similar to rhythm nation
but thugged out forgive me janet
whos in control im acvtivatin your soul
you know the way the games gettin sold
yo two years ago a friend of mine
told me alize and cristal blows your mind
bear witness to the dopest fuckin rhyme i wrote
takin off my coat clearing my throat

chorus method man

i got my mind made up come on come on
get in get in too get on it
let it ride get wit it tonights tha night
i got my mind made up come on
get in get in too
let it ride tonights tha night

verse three kurupt

well i comes through with two packs
of the bomb prophalaks for protection
so my fuckin sac wont collapse
cause nowadays shits evading the x-rays
sending young motherfuckers to an early grave
i wonder if my terrifying tactics of torturing mcs
shows my hearts as cold as the tundra
electryfing like thunder im just too much
rough and raw with that motherfuckin poisonous touch
im an mc with lyrics thats tha fuckin bom-bay
ya got dissed thats before its ingest like balmay
my rhymes i leave a mark on ya mind
as the deadly vibes spread through ya head like sam time
theres no escape nah i aint blastin
i use my mental to assassinate assassins for those askin
opposed to laughin raw maniacal villain
laughter enhances the chances of tha killin
why is that  cuz smilin faces decieve
you best believe to mcs im the deadliest disease
my thoughts rip ya throat and make it hard to breathe
ya whole camps under seige and im jason vorhees
in the heat of the night is when i defeat and ignite mikes
my verbal snipe your vocab on site
im out tha cut uncut and raw with no clause for all
so all my rhymes hit and split tha bricks on the wall
ya already have an idea about tha superior sphere
the greater rhyme creator on both sides of tha equator
i rock from here to there to philly and back
to la on the spot where i rock and bust like straps
as your views get overshadowed when you come in contact
beware set and prepare to enter verbal combat

verse four method man

fuck you losers while you fake jacks i makes maneuvers
like hitler stickin up jews wit german lugers
the mr meth-tical from staten isle
will be back after this mess-age dont touch tha dial
rarely do you see an mc out for justice
got my gun powder and my musket -- blaooow
melons get swellings i paint mental pictures like magellen
half of my clans three deep felons
niggaz best protect they joints for nine-nickel
man i stay on point like icicles
now who wanna test tical then touch tical
all up in your motherfuckin mouth
head banger boogie
catch me on tour with al doogie
method man roll too tight you can pull me
better take one and pass or thats that ass
your vital statistics are low and fallin fast
johnny blaze out to get loot like johnny cash
play a game of russian roulette and have a blast

verse five redman

aiyyo lyrical gas spittin tha criminal tactics
non-believers get my dick and genitals backwards
lets face it theres no replacement
taste this mad underground basement shit im laced with
avalanche on ya whole camp when im splifted
funk doctor who spock bitch dont get it twisted
i got connects like federal express
to get the fresh package of bless tha dogs cant fetch
got the clear spot from tha rear block
to bust til every nigga here drop men i fear not
hold ya nose and blow out til ya ears pop
since ya crew suit you to shift now you claim that you gets lot
with this underground cannabis
im dangerous like john the bomb analyst
then proceeds like keys
my degrees freeze consecutively like epmd lps
lick off a shot and hit ya fam by mistake
so i erase the whole front row at the wake
i planned my escape in case jake or a snake bust it
im the one pushin the hearse in the first place
confidence for you shaky ass folks
pump for rockafella for the day he got smoked
choke off this anecdote got you ope

i couldnt trust my own homies just a bunch a dirty rats

and hocus pocus try to focus but i cant see
and in my mind im a blind man doin time
look to my future cause my past is all behind me
is it a crime to fight for what is mine
everybodys dyin tell me whats the use of tryin
ive been trapped since birth cautious cause im cursed
and fantasies of my family in a hearse
and they say its the white man i should fear
but its my own kind doin all the killin here
i cant lie aint no love for the other side
jealousy inside make em wish i died
oh my lord tell me what im livin for
everybodys droppin got me knockin on heavens door
and all my memories of seein brothers bleed
and everybody grieves but still nobody sees
recollect your thoughts dont get caught up in the mix
cause the media is full of dirty tricks
only god can judge me

cause everytime i breathe i think they killin me beeping sound stops
im having nightmares homicidal fantansies
i wake up strangled in dangled in my bed sheets
i call the nurse cause it hurts to reminisce
how did it come to this i wish they didnt miss
somebody help me tell me where to go from here
cause even thugs cry but do the lord care
try to remember but it hurts
im walkin through the cemetary talkin to the dirt
id rather die like a man than live like a coward
theres a ghetto up in heaven and its ours black power
is what we scream as we dream in a paranoid state
and our fate is a lifetime of hate
dear mama can you save me and fuck peace
cause the streets got our babies we gotta eat
no more hesitation each and every black males trapped
and they wonder why we suicidal runnin round strapped

and have you ever made love with candles and bubbles sippin in the tub

the clouds shook the world listened
we stood together in april of ninety-two
with duty and a sense of honor
there is no limit to what we can achieve
thats all on us us
not my niggaz not the whites not the enemies
or none of them motherfuckers us
what can we do shit
i declare a death sentence to all child molestors
fake-ass bitches male and female
and all you punk-ass snitches
we can do without your asshole
let no man break what we set
where do we go from here

rest in peace to cato i miss you
all the other real gs that passed away in ninety-three
in ninety-four and more
what do we do for uschorus i wonder if heaven got a ghetto 4x

i was raised the little young nigga doin bad shit
talk much shit cause i never had shit
i could remember being whupped in class
and if i didnt pass mama whupped my ass
was it my fault papa didnt plan it out
broke out left me to be the man of the house
i couldnt take it had to make a profit
down the block got a glock and i clock grip
makin gs was my mission
movin enough of this shit to get my mama out the kitchen and
why must i sock a fella just to live large like rockefeller
first you didnt give a fuck but youre learnin now
if you dont respect the town then well burn you down
god damn its a motherfuckin riot
black people only hate police so dont try it
if youre not from the town then dont pass through
cause some og fools might blast you
it aint right but its long overdue
we cant have peace til the niggaz get a piece too
i want gs so you label me a criminal
and if i die i wonder if heaven got a ghetto

chorus

verse two 2pac

here on earth tell me whats a black life worth
a bottle of juice is no excuse the truth hurts
and even when you take the shit
move counties get a lawyer you can shake the shit
ask rodney latasha and many more
its been goin on for years theres plenty more
when they ask me when will the violence cease
when your troops stop shootin niggaz down in the street
niggaz had enough time to make a difference
bear witness own our own business
word to god cause its hard tryin to make ends meet
first we couldnt afford shit now everythings free
so we loot please dont shoot when you see
im takin from them cause for years they would take it from me
now the tables have turned around
you didnt listen until the niggaz burned it down
and now bush cant stop the hit
predicted the shit in 2pacalypse
and for once i was down with niggaz felt good
in the hood bein around the niggaz yeah
and for the first time everybody let go
and the streets is death row i wonder if heaven got a ghetto

chorus

verse three 2pac

i see no changes all i see is racist faces
misplaced hate makes disgrace to races
we under i wonder what it take to make this
one better place lets erase the wait state
take the evil out the people theyll be acting right
cause both black and white are smokin crack tonight
and only time we deal is when we kill each other
it takes skill to be real time to heal each other
and though it seems heaven-sent
we aint ready to have a black president huh
it aint a secret dont conceal the fact
the penitentiarys packed and its filled with blacks
i wake up in the morning and i ask myself
is life worth living should i blast myself
im tired of being poor and even worse im black
my stomach hurts so im lookin for a purse to snatch
cops give a damn about a ne-gro
pull a trigger kill a nigger hes a hero
mo nigga mo nigga mo niggaz
id rather be dead than a po nigga
let the lord judge the criminals
if i die i wonder if heaven got a ghetto

chorus to 27 from fade

just think if niggaz decide to retaliate
soldier in the house
i wonder if heaven got a ghetto 4x to fadethe only way to change me is maybe blow my brains out 
stuck in the middle of the game to get the pain out 
pray to my god everyday but he dont listen 
the poverty bothers me but mamas working wonders in the kitchen 
listen i can hear her crying in the bedroom 
praying for money we never think would she be dead soon 
am i wrong for wishing i was somewhere else 
at 13 cant feed myself 
can i blame daddy cause he left me 
wish he wouldve helped me 
too much like him til my mama dont love me 
on my own at a early age gettin paid 
and im strapped so ill never be afraid 
where did i go astray im hanging in the back streets 
running with gs and dope fiends will they jack me 
cant turn back my eyes on the prize 
i got nothing to lose 
everybody gotta die 
say good-bye to the bad guy 
that one you fucked when you passed by 
buck buck gunshots from a glock 
tempered glass fly 
do or die walk a mile in my shoes 
and youd be crazy too 
with nothing to lose 

i got nothing to lose thats why i got gang related 
got nothing to lose
got nothing to lose
got nothing to lose
got nothing to lose
got nothing to lose
nothing to lose 

i thank the lord for my many blessings 
though im stressin keep a vest for protection 
from the barrel of the smith &amp; wesson 
and all my niggas in the pen 
here we go again 
aint nothing separating us from a mack 10 
born in the ghetto as a hustla older 
straight soldier bucking at them bustas 
no matter how you try niggas never die 
we just retaliate with hate then we multiply 
see me striking down the block hittin coners 
mobbin like a motherfucka livin like i want to 
aint no stoppin at the red lights im sideways 
thug life muthafucka criiime pays 
let the cops put they lights on 
chase me nigga 
zig-zaggin through the freeway 
race me nigga 
in a high speed chase with the law 
the realest muthafucka that you ever saw 
im livin raw til they bury me dont worry me 
im high livin like i aint afraid to die 
and you could walk a mile in my shoes 
and youd be crazy too 

i got nothing to lose thats why i got gang related 
got nothing to lose
got nothing to lose
got nothing to lose
got nothing to lose
got nothing to lose
nothing to lose 

aint no escape from a deadly fate 
and everyday theres a million black bodies put away 
im startin to lose hope 
it seems everybodys on dope 
mama told me to leave cause she was broke 
sometimes i choke on the indo 
peepin out the window alone on my own 
im a criminal 
got no love from the household im out cold 
in the streets give me motherfuckin peace 
i got nothing to lose 
and something to prove 
what do i do live thug life nigga stay true 
i wonder when they kill me 
is there a heaven for a real g 
lord forgive me if you feel me 
cause all my life i was dirt broke 
with no hope lil skinny muthafucka wantin dough 
i hated cutting suckers with my razor blade 
but everyday its a struggle to get major paid 
anyway its so hard on a nigga in this city 
no pity and aint no love for the scrubs that be buyin time 
if you could walk a mile in my shoes youd be crazy too 
with nothing to lose 

i got nothing to lose thats why i got gang related

where they find me 16 on death row

dear mama these cops dont understand me

i kept it deep inside i done let it fuel my anger
im down for all my homies no mercy for a stranger
the brother in my set is 16 is wet
its hard to adapt when youre black and youre trapped in a livin hell
i shouldnta let him catch me
instead of livin sad in jail i coulda died free and happy
and my cellmates raped on the norm
and passed around the dorm you can hear his asshole gettin torn
they made me an animal
cant sleep instead of countin sheep niggaz countin cannibals
and thats how it is in the pen
turn old and cold and your soul is your best friend
my mama prayed for me
tell the lord to make way for me prepare any day for me why

the penitentiarys packed and its filled with blacks
i wake up in the morning and i ask myself

while im in bed leakin blood on my satin sheets
is there a heaven for a baller im gettin suspicious
of this bitch the line busy everytime i call her
now shes tellin me to visit who else is home
i check the house before i bone so we all alone
after i nut i hit the highway see ya later
to all the players watch the fly way a nigga played her
the bitch is tellin all her homies -- that i can fuck her
like no other now them other bitches wanna bone me
im under pressure gettin drunk somebody help me
i drink a fifth of hennesey i dont think its healthy
i see my enemies they creepin dont make me blast
i watch the five-ohs roll the motherfuckers pass
by me like they know me smilin as they laugh
i put up my middle finger then i dash
niggaz dont like me cause im thuggin and every day
im a hustler lookin to get paid

they wanna bury me im worried -- no need to lie
i pray to god i dont scream when its time to fry
nowhere to rest im losin homies aint that a bitch
when i was rich i had clout now a niggas lonely
i put the pistol to my head and say a prayer
i see visions of me dead lord are you there
then tell me am i lost cause im lonely
i thought i had friends but in the end a nigga dies lonely
nowhere to run im in terror and no one cares
a closed casket at my funeral and no ones there
is there a future for a killer  i change my ways
but still that dont promise me the next day
so i stay thuggin with a passion forever blastin
im bustin on these motherfuckers in my madness
they wonder if im hellbound well hell
cant be worse than this cause im in hell now
dont make me hurt you i dont want to but i will
see motherfuckers killed over green bills
never will i die ill be back
reincarnated as a motherfuckin mack
i love it cause in heaven theres no shortage on gs
im tellin you now you motherfuckers dont know me

only fear of death        you ghetto niggaz
only fear of death is comin back reincarnated
repeats continously w/ variations

hahaha i aint scared to die
i aint scared to die
to my homies in heaven

i aint scared to die
do you wanna live forever
are you scared to die
or will you scream when you fry

i dont fear death
my only fear of death is comin back reincarnated
this is dedicated to mental rip
and big kill rip
and all you other ogs who go down
i dont fear deathlittle somethin for my godson elijah and a little girl named corrine

verse one

some say the blacker the berry the sweeter the juice
i say the darker the flesh then the deeper the roots
i give a holler to my sisters on welfare
tupac cares if dont nobody else care
and uhh i know they like to beat ya down a lot
when you come around the block brothers clown a lot
but please dont cry dry your eyes never let up
forgive but dont forget girl keep your head up
and when he tells you you aint nuttin dont believe him
and if he cant learn to love you you should leave him
cause sista you dont need him
and i aint tryin to gas ya up i just call em how i see em
you know it makes me unhappy whats that
when brothas make babies and leave a young mother to be a pappy
and since we all came from a woman
got our name from a woman and our game from a woman
i wonder why we take from our women
why we rape our women do we hate our women
i think its time to kill for our women
time to heal our women be real to our women
and if we dont well have a race of babies
that will hate the ladies that make the babies
and since a man cant make one
he has no right to tell a woman when and where to create one
so will the real men get up
i know youre fed up ladies but keep your head up

chorus

ooooh child things are gonna get easier
ooooh child things are gonna get brighter

ooooh child things are gonna get easier
ooooh child things are gonna get brighter

verse two

aiyyo i remember marvin gaye used to sing ta me
he had me feelin like black was tha thing to be
and suddenly tha ghetto didnt seem so tough
and though we had it rough we always had enough
i huffed and puffed about my curfew and broke the rules
ran with the local crew and had a smoke or two
and i realize momma really paid the price
she nearly gave her life to raise me right
and all i had ta give her was my pipe dream
of how id rock the mic and make it to tha bright screen
im tryin to make a dollar out of fifteen cents
its hard to be legit and still pay tha rent
and in the end it seems im headin for tha pen
i try and find my friends but theyre blowin in the wind
last night my buddy lost his whole family
its gonna take the man in me to conquer this insanity
it seems tha rainll never let up
i try to keep my head up and still keep from gettin wet up
you know its funny when it rains and pours
they got money for wars but cant feed the poor
they say there aint no hope for the youth and the truth is
there aint no hope for tha future
and then they wonder why we crazy
i blame my mother for turning my brother into a crack baby
we aint meant to survive cause its a setup
and even though youre fed up
huh ya got to keep your head up

chorus

verse three

and uhh
to all the ladies havin babies on they own
i know its kinda rough and youre feelin all alone
daddys long gone and he left you by ya lonesome
thank the lord for my kids even if nobody else want em
cause i think we can make it in fact im sure
and if you fall stand tall and comeback for more
cause aint nuttin worse than when your son
wants to kno why his daddy dont love him no mo
you cant complain you was dealt this
hell of a hand without a man feelin helpless
because theres too many things for you to deal with
dying inside but outside youre looking fearless
while tears is rollin down your cheeks
ya steady hopin things dont fall down this week
cause if it did you couldnt take it and dont blame me
i was given this world i didnt make it
and now my sons getten older and older and cold
from havin the world on his shoulders
while the rich kids is drivin benz
im still tryin to hold on to survivin friends
and its crazy it seems itll never let up but
please you got to keep your head upsnoop up out of there

verse three 2pac

with all this extra stressin
the question i wonder is after death after my last breath
when will i finally get to rest  through this supression
they punish the people thats askin questions
and those that possess steal from the ones without possesions
the message i stress to make it stop study your lessons
dont settle for less - even the genius asks-es questions
be grateful for blessings
dont ever change keep your essence
the power is in the people and politics we address
always do your best dont let the pressure make you panic
and when you get stranded
and things dont go the way you planned it
dreamin of riches in a position of makin a difference
politicians and hypocrites they dont wanna listen
if im insane its the fame made a brother change
it wasnt nuttin like the game
its just me against the world

chorus

and shed so many tears
lord
i lost so many peers and shed so many tears

now im lost and im weary
so many tears im suicidal so dont stand near me
my every move is a compilated step
ta bring me closer
to embrace an early death now theres nothing left
there was no mercy on tha streets
i couldnt rest
im barely standing bout to go to pieces screaming peace
and though my soul was deleted i couldnt see it
i had my mind full of demons tryin ta break free
they planted seeds and they hatched sparking tha flame
inside my brain like a match such a dirty game
no memories just misery
painting a picture of my enemies killing me in my sleep
will i survive till tha morning ta see tha sun
please lord forgive me for my sins
cause here i come

chorus

lord
i suffer through tha years
and shed so many tears
god
i lost so many peers and

lord knows ive tried been a witness ta homicide
drive-bys taken lives little kids die
wonder why as i walk by
broken hearted as i glance at tha chaulk line gettin high
this aint tha life for me
i wanna change
but aint no future right for me
im stuck in tha game
im trapped inside a maze
see this tangaray influenced me ta gettin crazy
disillusioned lately
ive been really wanting babies
so i could see a part of me that wasnt always shady
dont trust my lady
cause shes a product of this poison im hearen noises
think shes fucken on my boys cant take no more
im fallin to tha floor
beggin for tha lord ta let me in heavens door
i shed so many tears

chorus

lord
i lost so many peers
and shed so many tears
i lost so many peers and shed so many tears
i suffered through tha years and shed so many tearswhat yall want
unconditional love no doubt
talking bout the stuff that dont wear off

itll last for all these crazy days
these crazy nights
whether you wrong or you right
im guna still love you
still feel you
still there for you
no matter what hehe
you will always be in my heart
with unconditional love

verse one

come listen to my truest thoughts my truest feelings
all my peers doing years beyond drug dealing
how many caskets can we witness
before we see its hard to live this life without god so we must ask forgiveness
ask mama why god deserved to die
witness the tears falling free from my eyes before she could reply
though we were born without a silver spoon
my broken down tv show cartoons in my living room hey
one day i hope to make it a player in this game
mama dont cry long as we try maybe things change
perhaps its just a fantasy
a life where we dont need no welfare shit with our whole family
maybe its me that caused it the fighting and the hurting
in my room crying cause i didnt want to be a burden
watch mama open up her arms to hug me
and i aint worried bout a damn thang with unconditional love

chorus 2x
in this game the lessons in your eyes to see
though things change the futures still inside of me
we must remember that tomorrow comes after the dark
so you will always be in my heart with unconditional love

verse two

just got the message youve been calling all week
been out here hustling on these streets aint had a chance to speak
but you know with you and me its on g
we could never be enemies cause you been such a good friend to me
where would i be without my dogs
no wonder why when times get hard cause it aint easy being who we are
driven by my ambitions desire higher positions
so i proceed to make gs eternally in my mission
is to be more than just a rap musician 
the elevation of todays generation if could make em listen
prison aint what we need no longer stuck in greed
time to play and strategize my familys gotta eat
when we make somethin out of nothing no pleasure in the suffering
neighborhood would be good if they could cut out all the busting
the liquor and the weed the cussing sending love out to my block
the struggle never stops unconditional love

chorus 2x
in this game the lessons in your eyes to see
though things change the futures still inside of me
we must remember that tomorrow comes after the dark
so you will always be in my heart with unconditional love

verse three

ill probably never understand ya ways 
with everyday i swear i hear ya
trying to change your ways while gettin paid at the same time
just had a baby with the same eyes 
something inside please let me die these are strange times
how come i never made it
maybe its the way the played it in my heart
i knew one day i gotta be a star
my hopes and all my wishes
so many vivid pictures and all the currency ill never even get to see
this fast life soon shatter us 
cause after all the lights and screams nothing but my dreams matter
hoping for better days maybe a peaceful night
baby dont cry cause everythang gonna be alright
just lay your head on my shoulder
dont worry bout a thang baby girl im a soldier huh
never treated me bad no matter who i was
you still came with that unconditional love

chorus 3x until fade
in this game the lessons in your eyes to see
though things change the futures still inside of me
we must remember that tomorrow comes after the dark
so you will always be in my heart with unconditional loveyou know they got me trapped in this prison of seclusion
happiness living on tha streets is a delusion
even a smooth criminal one day must get caught
shot up or shot down with tha bullet that he bought
nine millimeter kickin thinking about what tha streets do to me
cause they never talk peace in tha black community
all we know is violence do tha job in silence
walk tha city streets like a rat pack of tyrants
too many brothers daily heading for tha big penn
niggas commin out worse off than when they went in
over tha years i done alot of growin up
getten drunk thrown up
cuffed up
then i said i had enough
there must be another route way out
to money and fame i changed my name
and played a different game
tired of being trapped in this vicious cycle
if one more cop harrasses me i just might go psycho
and when i gettem
ill hittem with tha bum rush
only a lunatic would like to see his skull crushed
yo if your smart youll really let me go g
but keep me cooped up in this ghetto and catch tha uzi
they got me trapped

chorus
uh uh they cant keep tha black man down
they got me trapped
naw they cant keep tha black man down
trapped
uh uh they cant keep tha black man down
trapped
naw they cant keep tha black man down

they got me trapped
can barely walk tha city streets
without a cop harrassing me searching me
then asking my identity
hands up throw me up against tha wall
didnt do a thing at all
im tellen you one day these suckers gotta fall
cuffed up throw me on tha concrete
coppers try to kill me
but they didnt know this was tha wrong street
bang bang down another casualty
but its a cop whos shot theres brutality
who do you blame
its a shame because tha mans slain
he got caught in tha chains of his own game
how can i feel guilty after all tha things they did to me
sweated me hunted me
trapped in my own community
one day im gonna bust
blow up on this society
why did ya lie to me 
i couldnt find a trace of equality
work me like a slave while they laid back
homie dont play that
its time i lettem suffer tha payback
im tryin to avoid physical contact
i cant hold back its time to attack jack
they got me trapped

chorus
uh uh they cant keep tha black man down
you know they got me trapped
naw they cant keep tha black man down
trapped
uh uh they cant keep tha black man down
you know they got me trapped
naw they cant keep tha black man down

now im trapped and want to find a getaway
all i need is a g and somewhere safe to stay
cant use tha phone
cause im sure someone is tappin in
did it before
aint scared to use my gat again
i look back at hindsite the fight was irrelevant
but now hes tha devils friend
too late to be tellin him
he shot first and ill be damned if i run away
homie is done away i should of put my gun away
i wasnt thinkin all i heard was tha ridicule
girlies was laughin tup sayin damn homies is dissin you
i fired my weapon
started steppin in tha hurricane
i got shot so i dropped
feelin a burst of pain
got to my feet
couldnt see nothin but bloody blood
now im a fugitive to be hunted like a murderer
ran through an alley
still lookin for my getaway
coppers said freeze or youll be dead today
trapped in a corner
dark and i couldnt see tha light
thoughts in my mind was tha nine and a better life
what do i do 
live my life in a prison cell
id rather die than be trapped in a living hell
they got me trapped

chorus
uh uh they cant keep tha black man down
they got me trapped
naw they cant keep tha black man down
trapped
uh uh they cant keep tha black man down
you know they got me trapped
naw they cant keep tha black man down
trappedchorus

brendas got a baby

i hear brendas got a baby
but brendas barely got a brain
a damn shame
the girl can hardly spell her name
thats not our problem thats up ta brendas family
well let me show ya how it affects tha whole community
now brenda never really knew her moms 
and her dad was a junky
went in debt to his arms its sad
cause i bet brenda doesnt even know
just cause your in tha ghetto doesnt mean ya cant grow
but oh thats a thought my own revelation
do whatever it takes ta resist tha temptation
brenda got herself a boyfriend
her boyfriend was her cousin now lets watch tha joy end
she tried to hide her pregnancy from her family
who didnt really care to see or give a damn if she
went out and had a church of kids
as long as when tha check came they got first dibs
now brendas bellys gettin bigger
but no one seems ta notice any change in her figure
shes 12 years old and shes having a baby
in love with tha molester whos sexin her crazy
and yet through all she thinks that hell be with her forever
and dreams of a world with tha two of them are together
whatever
he left her and she had tha baby solo she had it on tha
bathroom floor
and didnt know so she didnt know what ta throw away and
what ta keep
she wrapped tha baby up and threw him in tha trash heep
i guess she thought shed get away
wouldnt hear tha cries
she didnt realize
how much tha little baby had her eyes
now tha babys in tha trash heep balling
momma cant help her but it hurts ta hear her calling
brenda wants ta run away
momma say you makin me lose pay and social workers here
everyday
now brendas gotta make her own way
cant go to her family they wont let her stay
no money no babysitter she couldnt keep a job
she tried ta sell crack but end up getting robbed
so now whats next there aint nothin left ta sell
so she sees sex as a way of leavin hell
its payin tha rent so she really cant complain
prostitute found slain and brendas her name shes got a
baby

besides bumpin n grindin wasnt nothin on our mind
in time we learned to live a life of crime
rewind us back to a time was much too young to know
i caught a felony lovin the way the guns blow
and even though we seperated you said that youd wait
dont give nobody no coochie while i be locked up state
i kiss my mama goodbye and wipe the tears from her lonely eyes
said ill return but i gotta fight the fates arrived
dont shed a tear cause mama i aint happy here

now we gotta slay you why you faded in the younger days
so full of pain while the weapons blaze
gettin so high off that bomb hopin we make it to the better days
cause crime pays and in time youll find a rhymell blaze
youll feel the fire from the niggaz in my younger days
so many changed on me so many tried to plot
that i keep a glock beside my head when will it stop
til god return me to my essence
cause even as a adolescents i refuse to be a convalescent
so many questions and they ask me if im still down
i moved up out of the ghetto so i aint real now

shock g
round and round round we go repeat 8xcome on come on
i see no changes wake up in the morning and i ask myself
is life worth living should i blast myself
im tired of bein poor and even worse im black
my stomach hurts so im lookin for a purse to snatch
cops give a damn about a negro
pull the trigger kill a nigga hes a hero
give the crack to the kids who the hell cares
one less hungry mouth on the welfare
first ship em dope and let em deal the brothers
give em guns step back watch em kill each other
its time to fight back thats what hueysaid
two shots in the dark now hueys dead
i got love for my brother but we can never go nowhere
unless we share with each other
we gotta start makin changes
learn to see me as a brother instead of two distant strangers
and thats how its supposed to be
how can the devil take a brother if hes close to me
id love to go back to when we played as kids
but things change and thats the way it is

thats just the way it is
thingsll never be the same
thats just the way it is
aww yeah

thats just the way it is
thingsll never be the same
thats just the way it is
aww yeah

i see no changes all i see is racist faces
misplaced hate makes disgrace to races
we under i wonder what it takes to make this
one better place lets erase the wasted
take the evil out the people theyll be acting right
cause both black and white is smokin crack tonight
and the only time we chill is when we kill each other
it takes skill to be real time to heal each other
and although it seems heaven sent
we aint ready to see a black president
it aint a secret dont conceal the fact
the penitentiarys packed and its filled with blacks
but some things will never change
try to show another way but you stayin in the dope game
now tell me whats a mother to do
bein real dont appeal to the brother in you
you gotta operate the easy way
i made a g today but you made it in a sleazy way
sellin crack to the kids i gotta get paid
well hey thats the way it is

thats just the way it is
thingsll never be the same
thats just the way it is
aww yeah

thats just the way it is
thingsll never be the same
thats just the way it is
aww yeah

we gotta make a change
its time for us as a people to start makin some changes
lets change the way we eat lets change the way we live
and lets change the way we treat each other
you see the old way wasnt working so its on us to do
what we gotta do to survive

and still i see no changes cant a brother get a little peace
its war on the streets and the war in the middle east
instead of war on poverty they got a war on drugs
so the police can bother me
and i aint never did a crime i aint have to do
but now im back with the facts givin it back to you
dont let em jack you up back you up
crack you up and pimp smack you up
you gotta learn to hold ya own
they get jealous when they see ya with ya mobile phone
but tell the cops they cant touch this
i dont trust this when they try to rush i bust this
thats the sound of my tool you say it aint cool
my mama didnt raise no fool
and as long as i stay black i gotta stay strapped
and i never get to lay back
cause i always got to worry bout the pay backs
some buck that i roughed up way back
comin back after all these years
rat-tat-tat-tat-tat

when i was young me and my mama had beef
17 years old kicked out on the streets
though back at the time i never thought id see her face
aint a woman alive that could take my mamas place
suspended from school scared to go home
i was a fool with the big boys breakin all the rules
shed tears with my baby sister
over the years we was poorer than the other little kids
and even though we had different daddies
the same drama when things went wrong we blamed mama
i reminisce on the stress i caused it was hell
huggin on my mama from a jail cell
and whod think in elementary hey id see the penitentiary
one day runnin from the police thats right
mama catch me put a whoopin to my backside
and even as a crack fiend mama 
you always was a black queen mama 
i finally understand for a woman it aint easy tryin to raise a man
you always was committed a poor single mother on welfare
tell me how you did it theres no way i can pay you back
but the plan is to show you that i understand

you are appreciated

lady dont ya know we love ya dear mama
sweet lady place no one above ya you are appreciated
sweet lady dont ya know we love ya

now aint nobody tell us it was fair
no love for my daddy cause the coward wasnt there
he passed away and i didnt cry
cause my anger wouldnt let me feel for a stranger
they say im wrong and im heartless
but all along i was lookin for a father he was gone
i hung around with the thugs and even though they sold drugs
they showed a young brother love
i moved out and started really hangin 
i needed money of my own so i started slangin
i aint guilty cause even though i sell rocks
it feels good puttin money in your mailbox
i love payin rent when the rents due
i hope you got the diamond necklace that i sent to you
cause when i was low you was there for me
you never left me alone because you cared for me
and i can see you comin home after work late
your in the kitchen tryin to fix us a hot plate
just workin with the scraps you was given
and mama made miracles every thanksgiving
but now the road got rough your alone
tryin to raise 2 bad kids on your own
and theres no way i can pay you back
but my plan is to show you that i understand

you are appreciated

lady dont ya know we love ya and dear mama
sweet lady place no one above ya you are appreciated
sweet lady dont ya know we love ya

pour out some liquor and i reminisce
cause through the drama i can always depend on my mama
and when it seems that im hopeless
you say the words that can get me back in focus
when i was sick as a little kid
to keep me happy theres no limit to the things you did
and all my childhood memories
are full of all the sweet things you did for me
and even though i act crazy
i got to thank the lord that you made me
there are no words that can express how i feel
you never kept a secret always stayed real
and i appreciate how you raised me
and all the extra love that you gave me
i wish i could take the pain away
if you can make it through the night theres a brighter day
everything will be alright if you hold on
its a struggle everyday gotta roll on
and theres no way i can pay you back
but my plan is to show you that i understand

you are appreciated

lady dont ya know we love ya dear mama
sweet lady place no one above ya you are appreciated

no doubt to live and die in la
california -- what you say about los angeles
still the only place for me that never rains in the sun
and everybody got love

verse one makaveli

to live and die in la where everyday we try to fatten our pockets
us niggaz hustle for the cash so its hard to knok it
everybody got they own thang currency chasin
worldwide through the hard times worryin faces
shed tears as we bury niggaz close to heart
what was a friend now a ghost in the dark cold hearted bout it
nigga got smoked by a fiend tryin to floss on him
blind to a broken mans dream a hard lesson
court cases keep me guessin plea bargain
aint an option now so im stressin cost me more
to be free than a life in the pen
makin money off of cuss words writin again
learn how to think ahead so i fight with my pen
late night down sunset likin this sin
whats the worst they could do to a nigga got me lost in hell
to live and die in la on bail my angel sing

chorus val young

to live and die in la its the place to be

remain beside me through these trials and this life of crime
we done fought so many times i forgot to count
i never hit you not a coward rather leave your house
remember back in december when we was tight
sippin alize and crystal while in every night
in my bedroom promise that ill commit to you sometime
kiss me every time you see me step inside a room
promise to be good to each other
plus i love ya so i know your gonna make a good mother
just try to understand if i change in time
its only cause i never owned anything thats mine
so im trying
you can stay with my mama but keep the drama to a low
never call the police i never call you bitch or hoe
we were all born hungry in this world alone

verse 2
going through these hard times
ghetto child of mine
i wonder if you have to suffer for your fathers crimes
to be honest its a hard road
just keep your faith in god knowing youll get scarred though
look at him walking and talking a little child with my eyes and mouth
father watch over little seeds help me guide them out
had to change my whole lifestyle
married my babys mama made her my wife now
im trying hard yall
maybe in time ill be a better man
watchin the older couples handle it like veterans
show me the meaning of together and forever we rise
if it would help our child grow then together we die
why question my love its so easy to see
without my family all im left with is a shadow of me
after all the arguments and the nights alone
now its time to live the good life
inside this happy home

chorus

outlawz 

[verse one tupac]

started with five shots niggas plotting to kill him 
never figured that that same nigga sell five million 
hit the charts like a mad man nothing but hits 
court cases got a nigga facing multiple digits 
dodging cop cars look how we come so far 
picture a high school drop out 
rolling a double r 
house full of happiness weed and drank 
way out 
so when trouble tried to find me cant 
never visioned living longer than my twenty first 
thought id locked down cracked out or in the dirt 
and though it hurts to see the change 
it comes with the fame 
watch them gossip in this silly game 
to all the motherfuckers speaking down on me this is the night 
whys everybody caught up in pacs life 
to all yall niggas 
conversating on my life 
mind your motherfucking business 

[chorus]

[verse two ti]

i remember that 
ay 
whats happening pac 
yeah i know we never got to meet 
but we know all the same people so we got to speak 
you taught me first fake nigga cant stop a g 
and all the shit you went through 
meant a lot to me 
but when they locked you up for for nothing it was shame to see 
you we know the crack came and did the same thing to me 
i get along with real niggas its the lane to be 
talking loud out of pocket tryna bang with me 
and so i pull it out my pocket let it rain you see 
now they all in the court room blaming me 
see we aint live the same life but represent the same struggle 
power to the real niggas death to the suckers 
money over bitches get to know em for you love em 
death before dishonour never talk to undercovers 
live by the same rules so i minus the tattoos 
with the same sort of dude with he same short fuse 

[chorus]

[verse three tupac]

i want money in large amounts 
my garage full of cars that bounce 
moving my tapes in major weight cause every dollar counts 
busters is jealous and half these niggas is punks 
they running off at the mouth till i fill it up with my pump 
they jump my automatic keep em weary 
while you fronting like you billy bad ass 
nigga you scary 
i been knowing you for years 
we was high school peers 
in junior high 
i was itching to kill 
and you was ready to die 
while you bullshitting niggas was dying and catching cases 
busting my automatics at motherfuckers in foreign places 
leaving no trace they see my face and then they buried 
bitches die in a hurry 
still i ride im never worried 
mr makaveli tell me to ride and ima ride 
pick my enemies out the crowd 
and motherfuckers die

selling them doves hanging with thugs and all that
beating up fools with a baseball bat
started having sex at only 14

got pregnant had a baby in december
she wont see the daddy till next september
moms and pops gave her the boot
kicked her out la casa now what raza
with the money she got she bought a spot of the block
started paying the rent by slangin phat ass coca rocks

and plus shes all smoked outthe base face

of  a life long cries

so get closer to the funk and slip into the backseat

chorus x2

they wanna band me cause a brothas makin noise a lot

they got me runnin down the street gettin hotter
runnin from the cops as i try to clock my glock
the war wont stop
thats why they wanna band the music
you ever notcie how the cops cant stand the music
see a black man coolin wit a mexican
we can all have peace the sun sets again
they try to shove us in the pen
but we clown and we frown every time we hit the top ten
once again its your friend outta oaklandhopin
to keep the hip hop clubs open
now we can lay back and let them closem
or we can have beef and show that we controlem
now aint nobody gettin paid its a damn shame
why gang bang brothas in the same gang

please wake me when i am free
i cannot bear activity
where my couch i am told hold no significance
i waited and died in ignorance
but my inner eye can see erase
who reigned as king in another place
the green trees were reached from fall
and every man spoke of beautiful men and women together as people

war was gone because all was at peace
but now like a nightmare i woke to see

that i live like a prisoner of poverty

please wake me when i am free
i cannot bear activity
fall i will have a  stricken blind
than to live without expression of mind

[providence] ooooh ooooh [rasdaveed] tell me i will be there
tell me i will be there
tell me i will be there
tell me i will be there
yeah

[verse 1] [providence]
if there be pain
all you have to do is call on me
if there be pain hmm hmmm
all you have to do is call on me
to be with you to be with you
and before you hang up the phone
you will no longer be alone
together we can never fall
because our love will conquer all

[rasdaveed chants]
[verse 2] [providence]
if there be pain
reach out for a helping hand
if there be pain
and i shall hold you wherever i am
every breath i breathe will be into you
for without you here my joy is through
my life was lived through falling rain
so call on me if there be pain

[outro] [providence &amp; rasdaveed el harar]
if there be pain
every breath i breathe will be into you
for without you here my joy is through
my life was lived through falling rain
so call on me if there be pain

if you need me
if you need me
ooohh oooohwhen your hero falls from grace all fairy tales are uncovered
myth exposed and pain magnified the grace pays uncovered
he told me to be strong but i confused to see it so weak
you say never to give up and it hurts to see what comes to be
when your hero falls soley the stars and so does the reception of tomorrow
without my hero theres only me alone to deal with my sorrow
your heart ceases to work and your soul is not happy at all
what are you expected to do when your only hero falls

as long as some suffer the river flows forever
as long as there is pain the river flows forever
as strong as a smile can be the river will flow forever
and as long as you are with me well ride the river together
and as long as you are with me well ride the river together

well ride the river together as long as you are with me
the river will flow forever as long as you are with me
the river will flow forever as long as you are with mestarry night an unknown creation
written by and from the archives of tupac shakur
dedicated to the memory of vincent van gogh

a creative heart obsessed with satisfying
this dorment and uncaring society
you have given them the stars at night
and you have given them bountiful bouquets of sunflowers
but for you theres only contempt
though you pour yourself into that frame and present it so proudly
this world could not accept your masterpieces from the heart
so on that starry night you gave to us and you took away from us
the one thing we never acknowledged your life

yeah game laid down by q whyknawmsayin
vocals by rasheeda fly beat by qdiii
and flows by the m-a-see whyall mr m-a-see mall

starry night your life
you gave to us and took away from us
starry night your life
you gave to us and took away from us

uh uh watch me live my art; writing words from my soul in blood
i speak the truth on every thang i love
ill probably sacrifice my life to send my message through mics
its like a war drum calling soldiers at night
its bigger than music i spit it straight from the heart
so its cold n dark and deep like a universe but nah dont start
its for ya entertainment but its my life why all
and i cant rewind fast forward or press pause
but when you give your all its like the fans demand more
and after the tour i sit alone like before
when ya name is hot its all love the world is yours
but when you fall off you get ignored

you on the cover of da magazine flossing on the tv screen
toastin wit yo champagne playin life like a game
loaded in the limousine love to hear the fans scream
swimmin wit the sharks now aint no love money king
people got they hands out but aint nobody lendin hands
can you really blame dem for tryin to get what they can
late night bright lights lust n lies
and anythang goes under the hollywood sign
well you might lose ya soul and who knows what you find
but go ahead main we all want to shine
but go ahead main we all want to shine

there you have it
whyknow when i was younger i prayed to get in this game
whyknow to hold dis microphone in my hand
i asked the man upstairs to let me rock a crowd one day
whyknow let people out there feel the way i feel through my music
like my homeboy tupac did fo sho
and he gave that to me
but he didnt he didnt he didnt let me know
about all the shady shit thats in in between
you and yo dream whyknow
see its more than the music i spit it from the heart
so sometime its cold n its dark but its raw
and thats how ima bring it to you every time whyknow4th avenue liberty jones k-ci

does not mean we are not created equally
is the true beauty in the tree
or in the vast forest in which it breathes

i find greatness in the tree that grows against all odds
it blossoms in darkness and gives birth to promising pods
i was that tree that grew from the weeds and wasnt meant to be
ashamed im not in fact i am proud of my thriving family tree

the rose that grew from concrete yeah
the tree that wasnt meant to be
though i struggle in my life i never give up
and you know that i will always be by your side
my family tree yeah a family tree

it blossoms in darkness and gives birth to a promising pod
youll never see me give up

because we all spring from different trees
does not mean we are not created equally
is the true beauty in the tree
or in the vast forest in which it breathes

the tree must fight to breathe
among the evils of the weeds

i find greatness in the tree that grows against all odds
ashamed im not in fact i am proud of my thriving family treelove within a storm
love within a storm
love within a storm
love within a storm

first it was nothin not even a fake 
loneliness was a daily for me until you came along
there was a gleam of a star in your eyes
thought id never feel this way again
and you were supposed to reach my heart
and find love within love love
ooohoooh

love within a storm
love within a storm
love within a storm
love within a storm
this sweet wonderful ghetto love
this sweet wonderful love that you give me
wonderful

i could not ignore the magnetism when i felt you near
any problems plaguin my mind was suddenly disappeared
it was re-birth of my heart the day that you became my friend
cause i knew for the moment i held you that i would fall in love again

fall in love again in a storm
love within a storm continues in background throughout next verses

just when i thought id seen it all
our paths crossed amen
and i knew from the first glance
that you would be hard to forget
your eyes attracted me first
but you reeked of sultry confidence
i couldnt wait to touch lips
and kiss with my hearts intention
when we didnt was what i expected
and for that moment we erased the tension
of the awkwardness of first date jitters
and the initial blind date first impressions
we kissed again; and i felt the passion
and this my love was cupids blessin

we made love within a storm
in the midst of passion and chaos
somewhere somehow our true bond of friendship was lost
in the eye of the storm the rain always falls harder
those who prevail this drama
will learn to bring their love farther
but now the storm has past
and the seas of our friendship are gone
but as long as i live i will remember
the love within a storm

love within a storm is repeated after every line
sweet passionate love-lusting love
ya know that i miss you and love you
ya know that tupac broke my heart
we need to hear ya hear ya voice
they say this ghetto fabulous

and left the house cause my momma says im good for nothing
so im out since i only got one life to live
god forgive me for my sins

aint no way in hell that i could ever be a rapist
its time to face this cold world on a good day
when will they let the little kids in the hood play
i got shot 5 times but im still breathing
living proof theres a god if you need a reason
god believe in my own fate
will i raise my kids in the right or the wrong way
dear mama im a man now
i wanna make it on my own not a hand out
make way for a whirlwind prophesized
i wanna go in peace
when i gotta die
on these cold streets
aint no love no mercy and no friends
in case you never see my face again
to my unborn child

pardon not disregardin what you thinkin but you musta been the ship
cause once i rip your whole shit is sinkin
supreme ideology you claim to hold
claimin that we all drug dealers with empty souls
that used to tempt me to roll commit to violence
in the midst of an act of war witnesses left silent
shatter black talon style thoughts i throw
it remains in your brain then of course it grows
maybe even your babies can produce and rise
picture a life where black babies can survive past five
but we must have hope quotin the reverand from the pulpit
refuse to turn the other cheek we must defeat the evil culprit
lace me with words of destruction and ill explode
but supply me with the will to survive and watch the world grow
this aint bout talkin bout problems i bring solutions
wheres the restitution stipulated through the constitution
you violated now im back to haunt your nights
listen to the screams of the lives you sacrificed
and in case you dont know ghetto born black seeds still grow
we comin back for everything you owe

chorus sung

told the judge it was self - defense he wont listen
so im bumpin this in federal prison givin everything i owe

chorus - 2xperhaps i was addicted to tha dark side
some where inside my childhood witnessed my heart die
and even though we both came from tha same places
tha money and tha fame made us all change places
could it be through tha misery
that came to past
the hard times make a true friend afraid to ask 
for currency 
but u could run to me when u need me 
ill never leave honestly someone to believe in as u can see
its a small thang through and true
what can i do real homies help you get through
and comin new hed do tha same thang if he could
cuz in tha hood true homies make you feel good
and happy times we be actin up call tha cops
bringin tha cease to tha peace that was on my block
it never stop when my mama ask me will i change
i tell her yeah but its clear ill always be tha same
until the end of time

chorus

please lord forgive me for my life of sin
my hard stare seem to scare all my sisters kids
so you know i dont hang around tha house much
this all night money makin got me outta touch shit

an unexpected birth worst of tha ghetto childs
my attitude got me walkin solo

watchin tha whole world move in slow mo
for quiet times i disappear and listen to tha ocean
smokin pots think my thoughts
then its back to coastin
who can i trust in this cold world
my phoney homie had a baby by my own girl
but i aint trippin im a playa

his next of kin
no remorse it was meant to happen
besides rappin tha only thing i did good was scrappin
until tha end of time

chorus

so take these broken wings
i need your hands to come &amp; heal me once again
until the end of time
so we can fly  until the end of time

until the end of time
so we can fly until the end of time

verse three

now whos to say if i was right or wrong
to live my life
as an outlaw all alone
remain strong in this planet full of playa hataz
they conversate but death row full of demonstrators
and in tha end drinkin henessey made all my enemies envy me
so cold when i flow eliminatin easily
falls to they knees they plead for their right to breath
while beggin me to keep tha peace haha
well i can see close into achieve
in times of danger dont freeze time to be a g

an ounce of game and tha trainin to make a g

buried as a g while tha whole world remembers me
until the end of time

chorus

aint shed a tear since the old school years of elementary 
niggers i used to love enclosed in penitentiaries
still homie keep it real how does it feel
to loose your life over something that you did as a kid
you all alone no communication block on the phone
dont get alone with your pops and plus your moms is gone
where did we go wrong i put my soul in this song
to help us grow in time but now our minds are gone
we went from brothers and sisters to niggers and bitches
we went from welfare livin to worldwide riches
but somethin change in this dirty game
everything strange lost all my homies over cocaine man
see they ask me if i shed a tear i aint lie
see you gotta get high or die
cause even thugz cry

chorus
oh why
should you send your child off to die
in the streets of chalk
when thugz cry
when they die
we dont shed a tear she shed blood
let the rocks cry out
when thugz cry
do you still wanna be a thug
dear god
oh why
does it have to be this way ahh
children of today wont stay by
let the children hear
when thugz cry
dear god 
oh why

verse three
and all i see are these paranoid bitches illegal inventions
bustin muthafuckas with uppercuts i leave em with dentures
cause in my criminal mind nobody violates the don
i write your name on a piece of paper and now your familys gone
well perpetrate like you could handle my team
so merciless in mind try to take command of your dreams
leavin muthafuckas drownin in they own blood
clown and takin pictures
later laugh at the punk bitches that turned snitches
regulate my area the terror i represent 
make your people disapear your wonderin where they went 
am i cold or is it just i sold my soul
addicted to the streets
never found true peace im told
come take my body god
dont let me suffer any longer 
smoke a pound of marijuana so i know it aint long
where is the end to all my misery
is there a close
i suppose thats why i murder my foes
when thugz cry

chorus
oh why
should you send your child off to die
in the streets of chalk
i shed tattoo tearz for years
when they die
let the rocks cry out
to my dead homeboyz and the prison peace
when thugz cry
dear god 
oh why
yall aint never heard my bries nigga what about if you would die
does it have to be this way ahh
children of today wont stay by
let the children hear
when thugz cry
dear god

five shots changed my whole life throats were slit
niggaz die by my orders when i wrote this shit
though we go back like wild knights at latin quarters
niggaz tried to kill me and i fed they wife and they daughters
blazed the weed draped they seeds gave em cash
pass the fame and let the game go rollin past

they got me twisted in this game
the feds and the punk po - lice pointin pistols at my brain
i wonder if im wrong cause im thugged out
my homies murdered execution style runnin in the drug house
what was supposed to be a easy hit - now shit is flipped
cause niggaz died over bullshit - its not my dream
im seein pictures of a broken man no witnesses
only the questions of who smoked the man young adolescents
in our prime live a life of crime though it aint logical
we hobble through these tryin times livin blind
lord help me with my troubled soul
why all my homies had to die fore they got to grow
and right before i put my head on the pillow say a prayer one love
to the thugs in heaven ill see you there
its written for the young and dumb that wasnt warned
help you make it through the storm
my words to my first born feel me

 my words to my first born
 my words to my first born

2pac
since my very first day on this earth i was cursed
so i knew that the birth of a child would make my life worse
and though it hurt me there was no distortion
cause wild seeds cant grow we need more abortions
quiet your soul cause you know what you had to do
and so did victims of a world they never came to
i understand its a better day comin
sometimes cats be sleepin on the dead end
drivin with the car runnin blinded
aint no love in the hood only hearts torn
love letters to the innocent and unborn
all the babies that died up on the table
wasnt able to breathe cause the family wasnt able
cant - blame her i would do the same
all i could give it was my debt and my last name
cause in the game things change livin up and down
this hard life got me walkin with my head down
flashin frowns wasnt meant to be was i wrong
but ill never get to know so i carry on
its written for the young and dumb that wasnt born
my words to my first born feel me

 my words to my first born
 mmm yeah these are the words to my first born
 hey nigga talk to your born talk to your seed nigga

above the law

exploit your weakness revenge flow deep without release
criminal orders across the waters bringin the war to the streets

like the sound of police who run the street really
and every hood let you grow

perhaps i was addicted to the dark side
some where inside my childhood i missed my heart die
and even though we both came from the same places
the money and the fame made us all change places
how could it be through the misery that came to pass
the hard times can make a true friend afraid to ask
for currency
but you could run to me when you need me
ill never leave honestly someone to believe in the shit we see
its a small thing through and true
what could i do
real homies help you get through
and comin knew hed do the same thang if he could
cause in the hood true homies make you feel good
but half the times we be actin up call the cops
bringin the cease to the peace that was on my block
it never stops when my mama ask me will i change
i tell her yeah but its clear ill always be the same
until the end of time
chorus
take these broken wings
i need your hands to come and heal me once again
until the end of time
so i can fly
till the end of time
take these broken wings

verse 2
please lord forgive me for my life of sin
my hard stare seem to scare all my sisters kids
so you know i dont hang around the house much
this all night money makin got me outta touch shit
aint flashed a smile in a long while
an unexpected birth worst of the ghetto childs
my attitude got me walkin solo
ride out alone in my low-low
watchin the whole world move in slow mo
for quiet times disappear listen to the ocean
smokin ports think my thoughts 
then its back to coastin
who can i trust in this cold world
my phony homey had a baby by my own girl
but i aint trippin im a playa 
i aint sweatin him
i sex his sister had her mumbling like a mexican
his next of kin
no remorse it was meant to happen
besides rappin the only thing i did good was scrappin
until the end of time

chorus
so take these broken wings
i need your hands to come and heal me once again
until the end of time
so i can fly
till the end of time
take these broken wings
youve got to learn to fly and learn to live so free
so i can fly
till the end of time

verse 3
now whos to say if i was right or wrong
to life my life as an outlaw all alone
remain strong in this planet full of playa hatas
they conversate but death row full of demonstrators
and in the end drinkin hennessey made all my enemies envy me
so cold when i flow illuminatin easily
falls to they knees
they plead for they right to breathe
while beggin me to keep the peace
ha ha
well i can see close into achieve
in times of danger dont freeze time to be a chief 
follow my lead i supply everything you need
an ounce of game and the trainin to make a g
remember me as an outcast outlaw

gettin raw till the day i see my casket
buried as a g while the whole world remembers me
until the end of time

chorus
take these broken wings
i need your hands to come and heal me once again
until the end of time
so i can fly
till the end of time
take these broken wings
youve got to learn to fly and learn to live so free
until the end of time
so i can fly
till the end of time
till the end of time

i dont know what it is that has me acting all crazy out here

now of course i want peace on the streets 
but realisticly 
painting perfect pictures aint never work 
my misery was so deep 
couldnt sleep through all my preasures 
my quest for cash 
i learned fast 
using violent measures 
memorys of adolescent years 
their was unity 
but after puperty we brought war
to our community 
so many bodies dropping 
its got to stop 
i want to help 
but still im stepping 
keeping my weapon 
must protect myself 
promise of a better tomorrow 
aint never reach me
plus my teachers were to petrfied in class to teach me 
sipping thunderbird 
and grape kool-aid 
calling earl since my stomach was empty 
it seduced me to fuck the world 
watch my lil homiez 
lose there childhood to guns 
nobody cries no more 
cause we all die for fun 
so why you ask me if i want peace 
if you cant grant it 
niggas fighting across the whole planet
so we can never be peace 

chorus 
will never be peace
or all we all just headed for doom
still consumed by the beefs
and ill know there never be peace
thats why i keep my 
pistol when i walk the streets
cause there never be peace 

marvelouz 
no time to rest 
they stressed out 
i cant remember the days my homie was here 
now a days we live in fear 
the stuggle is still here 
so now whos grabbing there strap 
whos getting bucked wild 
representing the generation of killers 
when i was a child had many dreams 
reality kept me and my homiez stressing 
tyring to raise my baby girl to be the strongest 
know when im doing wrongest 
i never had a bright day 
just drunkless smoking blunts 
getting faded 
wishing my partna made it 
if it was peace 
or 
i know there will never be 
all my tears were shed 
when i lost my homie number three 
its getting harder to see 
impossibilty should we just face it 
cant get through the pain 
but still i cant erase it 
so many trials and tribulations 
things we facing 
wicked days 
cant see no brighter days 
its time to chase it 
cross dreams 
cause the scene is when you never get by 
thats why i got to stay high 
youll never know when youll die 
my heart will never leave the ghetto 
i know to rise only in peace 
thats why i say 
there aint never going to be no peace 

chorus 
will never be peace
or all we all just headed for doom
still consumed by the beefs
and ill know there never be peace
thats why i keep my 
pistol when i walk the streets
cause there never be peace 

storm 
living life lonely 
but i cant even cry 
cause visions of diseption 
all around me 
got my eyes full of despise 
who can i trust 
why even try 
they say the world is mine 
but i know thats a lie 
living to die 
set up from birth 
steady dreaming 
wishing for better days 
but all i see is demons 
close my eyes 
reminisence of my childhood 
all i felt was pain from my arrival 
no memories of nothing nice 
nothing but blinded reminders of my future life 
im freaking out 
im getting closer to that other level 
will i be strong with game 
or just the heartless devil 
i hope im able to find peace in me 
cause theres a storm sixty four inches deep in me 
and i try to do the right thing 
but its the wrong thing 
that seems to bring me right back 
to this dirty game 
there never be peace

i feel ya 

verse 1 tupac 

she was born a heavy set girl with pig tails and curls 
a heart full of gold  still it wont change the world 
though she could never understand why 
some underhanded plans witnessed a man die 
was only 15 should have been a beauty queen 
still see here crying by the caskets when here parents got killed 
little girl dont cry  coz even though they died 
you can best believe they watching over thee from the sky 
never asked for this misery but look at what you getting
its a blessing in disguise when you find out your pregnant 
no money no home and even though you all alone 
you got to do this on your own  so baby go on 
i wish you luck and if you need me call 
just come to me and let me feed you all 
i can understand  the way it feels when you fighting the world 
facing all this drama when mamas just a little girl 

chorus 

mama dont know why 
mamas just a little girl 
given that she is or not 
time aint on her side 
mamas just a little girl 
mamas just a little girl 
she gotta hold her head up high 

verse 2 tupac 

at 16 what a beautiful thing 
the very essence of a jet black ebony queen 
and who could tell she would get pregnant at an early age 
she didnt listen had sex watch her belly raise hey 
got violated by someone she dated 
if this is fate i hate to see the seed she created 
so we wait though it takes time to build the body and the mind 
she reclines 9 months then finally its time 
what do we find 
a little groaning boy of mine with a tortured soul 
addicted to a life of crime had no time for the growing stage 
he learned his values on the streets at an early age 
watch for police dont come home why 
coz mammas acting crazy at the hospital about to have another baby 
like the rose from concrete groaning within 
blessed with twins how the hell can mamma raise 3 men 
so we began close as family such insanity 
a happy home for one act inhumanity 
plus mamas said the seed was corrupted 
used the rub her belly begging us to breathe if she love us 
now mama sits quiet sipping peppermint schnapps 
turned the house into a spot and made her watch for cops hey 
how could mama bring a thug like me into this world 
she aint the cause of all the drama cause mommas just a little girl 

chorus 

mama 
dont know why 
mamas just a little girl 
liven if she is or not 
time aint on her side 
cause amas just a little girl 
mamas just a little girl 
she gotta hold her head up high 
how could she raise us 

verse 3 tupac 

now would she remain in the same spot 
the gunshots rang they came from the cane spot 
now look here i see her clutching her son in her arms she hurt 
her heart bleeding as she watched her seed die in the dirt 
fulfil prophecy but who could stop the grief 
i walk around trying to hold the world up on top of me 
probably be an innocent man but still im the victim of a curse 
what could be worse nothing but pain 
since my birth taught me functions at the pen 
cause everybodys in paying back society im guilty of a life of sin 
i watched the drama occur my eyes blurred fore i jet it 
i wonder why we all have to die before we get it 
though we shed tears so many peers i done buried 
worried and scared knowing ima see the cemetery 
must be prepared in this cold world no-one cares 
no it aint fair  but we all there and do our share 
in this land of underhanded schemes and plans 
vivid dreams of a nigga having gs in hand 
mamma told me not to be a punk 
they aint a thing i wouldnt do for my mamma in this world 
cause you know i aint mad at cha you just a little girl 
see mammas just a little girl 
hey hey 

chorus 

*repeat until fade* 

mama 
dont know why 

and i aint facing all this dramacause mammas just a little girl 
they asked us why we mutilate eachother like we do 
and wonder why we hold such little worth on human life facin all this drama 
to ask us why we turn from bad to worse is to ignore from which we came 
you see you wouldnt ask why the rose that grew from the concrete had damaged petals 
on the contrary - we would all celebrate its tenacity we would all love its will to reach the sun 
wellwe are the roses this is the concrete and these are my damaged petals 
dont ask me whythank god nigga ask me how hahahaha 

heeeyyymopreme
it was a dope spot front yard one on one strapping
thats the way it was way before all the scrapping
earned my fucking props from the gs in the hood
put in work did some dirt never snitched never would
rollin the fat jaguars with my nigga p blowing up
time coming back sipping hennessey
seventeen years old and i felt like god mad rich
and i had my pick of any fine bitch
and my family was known to be great seen slightly more
representing no matter who sets it on
street power why you niggaz flip and you thug shit
i be bout my motherfucking grip nothing else
gets between me and mine just remember that
damn its a shame but still im in the game
im trying to get street fame

chorus
im a superstar im a superstar
im a superstar made it by street fame
im a superstar im a superstar
im a superstar made it by street fame

big syke
dont blame my mama dont blame my daddy
i know they wish they never had me
in and out of jail by twelve failing out of school
cause i was living by the street rules
hanging with hogs dropping dogs as a little loc
i was getting my respect but i was still broke
into the game and expanded to the cocaine
went from double-ups to slanging them whole things
focused on my mail name ringing like a bell
and even with no proof they gonna put me in jail 
everybody says hes sold and im outta control
motherfuckers gossip but i still roll nigga
bitches want my cash on my dash of my cockpit
they wouldnt know a motherfucker if he didnt have shit
so while im balling and kicking up dust get yo skull crushed
bitch-made niggaz know not to fuck with us
cause im living on the edge im blasting lead
wanted by the feds they got to take me dead
so fuck it drive a bucket in the inner city
in the land of no pity i made it by the street fame

chorus - 2x
im a superstar im a superstar
im a superstar made it by street fame
im a superstar im a superstar
im a superstar made it by street fame

the rated r
im a super star made it by street fame
i had to make some people feel the pain in this dirty game
i know im on my way to hell
aint no yellow bricked road for all the niggas that i done smoked
the hood done took me under a nigga gots no heart
dont get it twisted cause im there with my homeys car
i kill for my niggaz my niggaz kill for me
thats the love you get from the drunk one you put in work see
im a g with a gang of niggaz after me
trying to peal me cause i smoked they homey
what comes around goes around is what makes it worse
i smoke blunts all day to keep my mind off a hearse
they dont stop stop till my casket drop drop
let me ride but all i want thou shalt not beef or die
and it dont matter if i rap or plays
cause i blow out back of some minds fuck the fame

chorus
im a superstar im a superstar
im a superstar made it by street fame
im a superstar im a superstar
im a superstar made it by street fame

 made it by street fame
repeat to the end[verse 1 2pac]
i started out dumb sprung off o hood rats
listening to the radio wishing that i could rap
but nothing changed i was stuck in the game
cause everybody in the industry was fucking me man
listen ive got a scheme break away do my own thing
drop some conversation sit back and let the phone ring
niggas aint wanna see me rise
97 watch me cut these motherfuckers down to size
and if i catch another case lord knows how they hate me
got a playa in the court room please dont let em frame me
ive been dealt a lot of bad cards living as a thug
count my blessings and dont stress in this land with no love
maybe they see me rollin look at all this green im holdin
i guess thats why theyre envious and get their eyes swollen
hoping the heavenly father love a hustler
be the hardest nigga on earth to ever bust a nut
my homies tell me have a heart — fuck theyre feelings
ive been trying to make a million since we started
we cold hearted niggas in masks thatll blast at the task force
empty out my clip time to mash they asked for it

niggas talk a lot of non-shit i choose to ignore
a war they aint ready for it

chilling im living monday through sunday 
bringing the gun play for all these beefs and battles

torn ligaments all up in that niggas shoulder
and a vest couldnt protect that flesh
cause i got slugs to knock the air out your chest

aint no heaven for a thug nigga
thats why we go to thug mansion
thats the only place where thugs get in free and you gotta be a g
 at thug mansion

verse one 2pac
a place to spend my quiet nights time to unwind
so much pressure in this life of mine i cry at times
i once contemplated suicide and would of tried
but when i held that 9 all i could see was my momas eyes
no one knows my struggle they only see the trouble
not knowing its hard to carry on when no one loves you
picture me inside the misery of poverty
no man alive has ever witnessed struggles i survived
praying hard for better dayz promise to hold on
me and my dogs aint have a choice but to roll on
we finally found a spot to kick it
where we can drink liquor and no one bickers over trick shit
a spot where we can smoke in peace and even though we gs
we still visualize places that we can roll in peace
and in my minds eye i see this place the players go in fast
i got a spot for us all so we can ball at thugz mansion

chorus j phoenix + nas
every corner every city
theres a place where lifes a little easy
little hennessey laid back and cool
every hour cause its all good
leave all the stress from the world outside
every wrong done will be alright i wanna go
nothing but peace i wanna go love i wanna go nigga
and street passion every ghetto needs a thug mansion

verse two nas
a place where death doesnt reside just thugs who collide
not to start beef but spark trees no cops rolling by
no policemen no homicide no chalk on the streets
no reason for nobodys momma to cry
see im a good guy im trying to stick around for my daughter
but if i should die i know all of my albums support her
this whole years been crazy asked the holy spirit to save me
only difference from me and ozzie davis grey hair maybe
cause i feel like my eyes saw too much suffering
im just twenty-some-odd years i done lost my mother
and i cry tears of joy i know she smiles on her boy
i dream of you more my love goes to afeni shakur
cause like ann jones she raised a ghetto king in a war
and just for that alone she shouldnt feel no pain no more
cause one day well all be together sipping heavenly champagne
where angels soar with golden wings in thugz mansion

chorus w/o nas

verse three 2pac
dear momma dont cry your baby boys doing good
tell the homies im in heaven and they aint got hoods
seen a show with marvin gaye last night it had me shook
drinking peppermint schnapps with jackie wilson and sam cooke
then some lady named billie holiday
sang sitting there kicking it with malcolm til the day came
little latasha sure grown
tell the lady in the liquor that shes forgiven so come home
maybe in time youll understand only god can save us
when miles davis cutting loose with the band
just think of all the people that you knew in the past
that passed on they in heaven found peace at last
picture a place that they exist together
there has to be a place better than this in heaven
so right before i sleep dear god what im asking
remember this face save me a place in thugs mansion

chorusthey got a nigga shedding tears reminiscing on my past fears
cause shit was hectic for me last year
it appears that ive been marked for death
my heartless breath the underlying cause of my arrest
my life is stressed and no rest forever weary
my eyes stay teary for all the brothers that are buried in the cemetery
shit is scary how black on black crime legendary
but at times unnecessary im getting worried
teardrops and closed caskets the three strikes law is drastic
and certain death for us ghetto bastards
what can we do when were arrested but open fire
life in the pen aint for me cause id rather die
but dont cry through your despair
i wonder if the lord still cares for us niggaz on welfare
and who cares if we survive
the only time they notice a nigga is when he clutching on a four-five
my neighbourhood aint the same
cause all these little babies going crazy and they suffering in the game
and i swear its like a trap
but i aint given up on the hood its all good when i go back
hoes show me love niggaz give me props
forever hop cause it dont stop on my block

chorus
living life is but a dream
hard times is all we see on my block
every block is kinda mean
but on our block we still pray
but on our block we still pray

now shits constantly hot on my block it never fails to be gunshots
cant explain a mothers pain when her son drops
black male slipping in hail when will we prevail
fearing jail but crack sales got me living well
and the systems suicidal with this thugs life
staying strapped forever strapped in this drug life
god help me cause im starving cant get a job
so i resort to violent robberies my life is hard
cant sleep cause all the dirt make my heart hurt
put in work and shed tears for my dead peers
mislead from childhood where i went astray
till this day i still pray for a better way
cant help but feel hopeless and heartbroke
from the start i felt the racism cause im dark
couldnt quit the bullshit make me represent
hit the bar and played the star everywhere i went
in my heart i felt alone out here on my own
i close my eyes and picture home on my block

chorus

and i cant help but wonder why so many young kids had to die
caught strays from aks and the driveby
swollen pride and homicide dont coincide
brothers cry for broken lives mama come inside
cause our block is filled with danger
used to be a close knit community but now were all cold strangers
time changes us to stone them crack pipes
all up and down the block exterminating black life
but i cant blame the dealers
my mamas welfare check has brought the next man chrome wheels
shits real i know you feel my tragedy
a single mother with a problem child daddy free
hanging out picking up game sipping cheap liquor
gamin the hoochies hoping i can get to sleep with her
its a mans world staying strapped
fantasies of a nigga living fat but held back
pipe dreams can make the night seem hopeless
wide eyed and losing focus on my block

chorus

and block parties in the projects lasting way past daylight
a young nigga learned to break nine
used to play fight with my homies but they stuck in the pen
i send them ends but its tough on a friend in my mind
i see the same motherfuckers balling
alcohol will make a lazy nigga slip and fall miss his call
i know the young niggaz understand this
growing up in this world where everything is scandalous
i reminisce on the fast times past crimes
trying to cop a slice of pizza with my last dime
cant explain just what attracts me to this dirty game
gold chains some extra change and the street fame
and whats strange is that everybody knows my name swear they all know me
and lots of cash make a nigga change
i hit the green just to maintain feeling pain
for all the niggaz that i lost to the game from my blocktupac
shit tired of getting shot at
tired of getting chased by the police and arrested
niggas need a spot where we can kick it
a spot where we belong thats just for us
niggas aint gotta get all dressed up and be hollywood
you namean
where do niggas go when we die 
aint no heaven for a thug nigga thats why we go to thug mansion
thats the only place where thugs get in free and you gotta be a g
at thug mansion

picture me inside the misery of poverty
no man alive has ever witnessed struggles i survived
praying hard for better dayz promise to hold on
me and my dogs aint have a choice but to roll on
we finally found a spot to kick it
where we can drink liquor and no one bickers over trick shit
a spot where we can smoke in peace and even though we gs
we still visualize places that we can roll in peace
and in my minds eye i see this place the players go in fast
i got a spot for us all so we can ball at thugz mansion

chorus anthony hamilton

children dead homies and family

only place thats right for me
chromed out mansion in paradise

2pac
will i survive all the fights and the darkness
trouble sparks they tell me home is where the heart is dear departed
i shed tattooed tears and couldnt sleep good
for multiple years witness peers catch gunshots
nobody cares seen the politicians ban us
theyd rather see us locked in chains please explain
why they cant stand us is there a way for me to change
or am i just a victim of things i did to maintain
i need a place to rest my head
with the little bit of homeboys that remains cause all the rest dead
is there a spot for us to roll if you find it
ill be right behind ya show me and ill go
how can i be peaceful  im comin from the bottom
watch my daddy scream peace while the other man shot him
i need a house thats full of love when i need to escape
the deadly places slingin drugs in thugs mansion

chorus

2pac
dear mama dont cry your baby boys doing good
tell the homies im in heaven and they aint got hoods
seen a show with marvin gaye last night it had me shook
drinking peppermint schnapps with jackie wilson and sam cooke
then some lady named billie holiday
sang sitting there kicking it with malcolm til the day came
little latasha sure grown
tell the lady in the liquor that shes forgiven so come home
maybe in time youll understand only god can save us
when miles davis cutting loose with the band
just think of all the people that you knew in the past
that passed on they in heaven found peace at last
picture a place that they exist together
there has to be a place better than this in heaven
so right before i sleep dear god what im asking
remember this face save me a place in thugz mansion

time to question our lifestyle look how we live 
smoking weed like it aint no thing so even kids wanna try now 
then lie down and get ran through 
nobody watches them clocking the evil men do 
faced with the demons addicted to hearing victims screaming 
guess we was evil since birth product of cursed semens 
cause even our birthdays are cursed days 
a born thug in the first place the worst ways 
id love to see the block in peace 
with no more dealers and crooked cops the only way to stop the beasts 
and only we can change its up to us to clean up the streets 
it aint the same too many murders
too many funerals and too many tears 
just seen another brother buried plus i knew him for years 
pass by his family but what could i say 
keep your head up and try to keep the faith and pray for better dayz

i sit and wonder is there a way you could forget me

me and you in satin sheets til after two 
come take a walk on the wild side enjoy the view 
whenever we collide; its bound to be a pleasurable time 
making love til the early light 
sweetheart dont fight the feeling 
come get a shot of this plain dealing and concentrate on the ceiling 
its my intention to brush up 
beware of the fireworks cause every time we touch 
 its bound to be so relax clown with me 
as if youre down with me get around and see 
the brother with tattoos and no fears 
running my fingers through your hair if you call me 

chorus

face to face with us locked up in strange places what will it take

got a law for raw niggas now player what it be like 
when will niggas see they got us bleeding with 3 strikes 
cant seem to focus  hopeless with violent thoughts 
i wrote this got these devils petrified hiding from my hocus pocus 
and so i learned to earn my currency and over time 
affiliated clearly click a military mind 
may god forgive us though we dwell inside a paradox 
thugged out and drug dealing from the womb to the block 
my live mind got me surviving 5 shots  
my 45 got me fortified with live rounds 
when shit stick we plot hits when our block spits 
all hail out on bail wrath of 2pacalypse
forever ghetto necessary picture food stamps 
outlaw thug niggas never left the boot camp 

verse 2 buckshot &amp; cocoa brovas 

im a nigga for assignment 
one of the squads finest echo 
skilled in gorilla warfare 
and blessed 
work with firearm 
my rap shit 
contains sections of bomb sessions 
says im responsible for black smith and wessons 
putting up on  in the military state of mind 
dangerous like chronic and yard when combined 
cocoa brovas pan the borderline 
thats the sound and your dead son 

man to man 
im facing the devil with a plan echo 
judo stance 
first glance 
im making my advance echo 
animal instincts 
intelligence of an assassin

surround me ready to attack i react swiftly 
what father taught me sticks with me 
never forget the methods stick and move strictly 
shit be seeming like its closing in 
with no regrets i hold position 
cause i circles 
im one of the chosen men echo 

picture being put in position to move 
and you cant move cause your move is blocked by the knight at 12 oclock 
thats when the madness beings so i start to focusing 
my thoughts on the war cause the rule is the law echo 
and the law that we live by is to stay true to self 
in this case beady eye echo 
why try everybody lie 
about the block true soldier mentality 
this is how we rock and move echo 

stick and move 
time to show what kinda nigga 
move or get moved on 
lets see whos strong echo 

in the days of the strange where nothing stays the same 
with new faces come through with similar game echo 
and who you thought them really aint they echo 
catching deja vu of the game people play echo 
its a call for re-adjustment fine tune your positions 
you slipping and tripping instead of bobbing and dipping echo 
will never let this world of stress get me echo 
taking breathing techniques slay you with tai chi echo 

what did you change to get a break in the world of snakes 
and those who fake elimination im facing destruction 
outlaw till i duck down from po pos busting 
no one to trust in rushing to the goal line 
catch a nigga beat him treat him like he stole mine 
no swine im a soldier told cha i control mine 
time to take you back into time follow this here 

one way out 
this black hole 
for this black soul 
shit is outta control 
im fighting for my position 
to be a fetus in this world i am entering 
and my face is sentencing for repentance 
before my body was fully formed into a human 
i was already consuming weed 
cause my moms use to smoke back in the 70s 
maybe thats why in the 90s i drop gs when i drop degrees 
when i ease across the block with pac 
and got all you niggas shot 
you didnt think boot camp click would link 
with the outlaw minded if you do you press rewind 
and you can peep gorilla tactics in every line

nothing but pain stuck in this game 
searching for fortune and fame 

the one thing we all adore

searching for fortune and fame 

verse 1 2pac 
though we exist and breathe some believe currency comes to gs 
stresses after battle with success comes greed 
they got me hot when they shot me plotted my revenge 
to increase my ends enemies getting dropped 
win or lose red or blue we must all stay true 
play the game nigga never let the game play you 
and for the fame niggas change fast thats a shame 
whats the game lost souls who controls our brain 
who can i blame the world seems strange at times 
somewhat insane im hoping we can change with time 
im living blinded searching for refinement 
curse i know death follows me but i murder him first 
and worse yet with each breathe steps i take 
breathless ss there a cure for a hustler with a death wish 
cigar ashes coaster crystal glasses 
we mash on them jealous bastards with a ski mask 
im the first one to warn them blast it 
wrapped in plastic bullshitting got his ass hit outlaws 
aint nothing left now treated like a stepchild 
was not for me nothing but busters and bitches fuck em all 
be rocking beats fake in fame 

verse 2 kadafi 
block run and shoot slugs 
we throw them back like hardballs 
without the gloves 
no love for these fake desperados 
and thugs i bleed to envy 
smoke and blow out they blunts 
sipping henney 
drunk nights and hot days 
cocking my heat shooting it sideways 
a wife on the run full of common blunts 
unconditionally married to my gun 
fulfillin my destiny on knees 
and ones desires be pulling all my cabbage like priors 
stuck in the trance searching for something higher 
fortune and fame 

chorus 

verse 3 kastro 
searching for fortune and fame lost in the rain 
a lose of the game with life the cost of the game 
we forcing the change mother fuck flossing the chain 
all the blame belongs to the part of the brain 
that we never use nigga plus my heart is in pain 
and if i ever lose homey bet im at it again 
outlaws dont die so united we stand 
and if family come before all the fortune and fame

verse 4 napoleon 
as i walk up in the crib laid to rest me head 
say some rhymes to angels hope they bless my bed 
hope they bless me the righteous way 
got a homie locked down outta town i sent him a kite today 
man that hate in your heart you gotta cleanse it dog 
praying for my downfall and i can sense it dog 
i was passed down the street fame like glocks clocked and keep aim 
was raised up with a clock box and i ran with the local street gang 
they say the light is faded but still shine in the dark 
you can easy been a man but you is a boy in your heart 
and thats some game that i got from generation of game 
in the road of life dog we need to switch up lanes 
think about it 

chorus 

verse 5 young noble 
i cant complain ive seen my fair share of the fame 
it wont change me now ive got this piece of change 
i feel strange i got so used to the hood 
that when i finally got out at first it aint feel good 
i was just a baby still retarded from slavery 
when we struggle to shovel shit aint nobody saved me 
ghetto aint made me i made myself 
poverty raised me thinking aint no help 
i pray for my health my mind and my family too 
state of myself my grind and my family crew 
where one hand watches the other no we aint blood 
but we still real brothers the struggle is real 
nothing can steal what we build and that remains the same 
till that day we killed and thats real 
life that i was aimed to be love by my family tree 
thats fame to me how about it 

chorusverse 1 tupac

partners in passionate sex a place to put my erection

cause when we fuck i refuse to bust a nut until i beat it up
drop the top time to fuck while the wind blow
baby throw yo legs out the window
remember on the balcony bend over baby bounce on me
and let me hit it where it counts and flee
remember me i get around and im haunted by my temptations

took a while but i finally got it and like a boss player
bitch you aint doing me no favours fair xchange

chorus

only one thing that you can do for me

verse 3 tupac

now yo attitude aint realistic
yeah its true im getting pussy but baby you getting dick
and since you being laced with the penetration
its only right to show a form of appreciation
instead of faking like you cant hear the bed shaking
in bed naked you so twisted think yoour legs breaking

doggy style steady pumping on that ass until i blast
and then i laugh as we lay back
see i wait til you asleep and thats the payback
cause you acting like you did something giving me a piece

a true digger that love triggers a thug nigga
hustling bitches like drug dealers
before i say goodbye put an end to all the games
heres my number for another fair xchange

2pac 
i see mothers in black crying brothers in packs dying 
plus everybodys high too doped up to ask why 
watching our on downfall witness the end 
its like we dont believe in god cause we living in sin 
i asked my homie on the block why he strapped he laughed 
pointed his pistol as the cop car passed and blast 
its just another murder nobody mourns no more 
my teardrops getting bigger but cant figure what im crying for 
is it the miniature caskets little babies 
victims of a stray from drug dealers gone crazy 
maybe its just the drugs visions of how the block was 
crack came and it was strange how it rocked us 
perhaps the underlying facts they hide explain genocide 
its when we ride on our own kind 
what is it we all fear reflections in the mirror 
we cant escape fate the end is getting nearer 

chorus 2x 
who do you believe in i put my faith in god 
blessed and still breathing and even though its hard 
thats who i believe in before im leaving 
im asking the grieving who do you believe in 

tupac 
cant close my eyes cause all i see is terror 
i hate the man in the mirror cause his reflection makes the pain turn realer 
times of armageddon murder in mass amounts 
in this society where only getting the cash counts 
i started out as a beginner 
entered the criminal lifestyle became a sinner 
i make my money and vacate evade prison 
went from the chosen one to outcast unforgiven 
and all the hennessey and weed cant hide the pain i feel inside 
you know its like im living just to die 
i fall on my knees and beg for mercy not knowing if im worthy 
living life thinking no man can hurt me so im asking 
before i lay me down to sleep 
before you judge me look at all the shit you did to me my misery 
i rose up from the slums made it out the flames 
in my search for fame will i change 
and im asking 

chorus x2 

kadafi 
faith in allah believe in me and its plastic 
cause so far i done witnessed to many dead niggas in caskets 
with they chest plates stretched like elastic 
and whats worse im on front line holding down camp still mashing 
heard my cousin one of the old heads from the block 
just came home october of 95 back in yardville stuck
with a three to five if he dont act up 
now he realize if you dont stay wise then in this game you fucked 
talk to my baby girl give me the word on what she heard 
one of the grimmies is snitching diming a stool pigeon 
i talked to him he said he didnt my man said he did
in fact he sure cause he just came home off a bid 

chorus x2 

who do you believe in
 is it buddah jehova 
or jah or allah 
is it jesus is it god 
or is just yourself 
definitely not to be imposed 
even a demon 
cause this is the joy of the movement 
men to believe in yourselves 
but for sure the higher power 
resides only to ride through the heart of the true 
from the soul of the man 
for truth never has an alibi 
in the poetry or in this round 
thats what pulls our words together 
just to understand 
that every man is his own man 
and only man can satisfy the man 
only the soul of the man 
the feelings of the man 
the for realness of the man 
you cant shake the man when you feel the man 
you know the man 
and you gotta call yourself because you are that man 

tupac over female singing 

who do you believe in i put my faith in god 
put my faith in god and 
blessed and still breathing 
even though its hard who do you believe in 
thats who i believe in even though its hard 
before im leaving 
im asking the grieving who do you believe in 
who do you believe in 
who do you blessed and still breathing 
oh blessed before im leaving im asking the grieving 
oh blessed who do you believe intupac

as i take you through a ghetto niggas lullaby
on the corner where the niggaz slang they crack
and the undercovers jack those that dont watch they back

take a puff from the blunt and watch the smoke swirl
my mossberg goes boom whats another plug
snatchin drugs pumpin slugs in these other thugs

who rules the entertainment industry basically
i was like this is like a fuckin election you know what im sayin

it is it is that me and biggie situation was smaller
than that me and biggie situation was like

why am i fighting to live if i m just living to fight
why am i trying to see when there aint nothing in sight
why am i trying to give when no-one gives me a try
why am i dying to live if im just living to die

check it i grew up a fucking screw up
got introduced to the game got an ounce and fucking blew up
chopping rocks over night
the nigga biggie smalls trying to turn into black frank white

we had a code dress to change our description
two cops is on the milk box missing
showed they codes know they got stepped on
a fist full of bullets a chest full of teflon

run from the police picture that
nigga im too fat i fuck around and catch an asthma attack
thats why i bust back and dont face me
when he drop take his glock and im swayze

celebrate my escape sold a glock
bust some weight lay back i got some money to make
motherfucker

why am i fighting to live if im just living to fight
why am i trying to see when there aint nothing in sight
why am i trying to give when no-one gives me a try
why am i dying to live if im just living to die its on me

but still im having memories of high speed when the cops crash
as i laugh pushing the gas while my glocks blast
we was young and we was dumb but we had heart
in the dark will we survive through the bad parts

many dreams is what i had and plenty wishes
no hesitation in extermination of these snitches
envious bitches they still continue to pursue me
a couple movies now the whole worlds trying to screw me

even the cops trying to sue me so what can i do but stay true
sippin twenty twos of brew
and now the media is trying to test me
got the prest asking question tryin to stress me

misery is all i see thats my mind state
my history with the polices shake the crime rate
my main man had two strikes slip got arrested and flipped
he screamed thug life and emptied a clip
got shot runnin from the police

why am i fighting to live if i m just living to fight
why am i trying to see when there aint nothing in sight
why am i trying to give when no-one gives me a try
why am i dying to live if im just living to die

i was shocked at everything know what im sayin

as real as it seems the american dream
aint nothing but another calculated scheme
to get us locked up shot up or back in chains
to deny us of the future rob our names
kept my history a mystery but now i see
the american dream wasnt meant for me
cause lady libertys a hypocrite she lied to me
promised me freedom education equality
never gave me nothing but slavery
and now look at how dangerous you made me
calling me a mad man cause im strong and bold
with this gun full of knowledge of the lies you told
promise me emancipation in this new nation
all you gave my people was our patience
fathers of our country never cared for me
they kept my answer shackled up in slavery
and uncle sam never did a damn thing for me
except lie about the facts in my history
so now im sitting here mad cause im unemployed
but the governments glad cause they enjoy it
when my people are down so they can screw us around
time to change the government now panther power

chorus
panther power
panther power
panther power

tyson
panther power from the strength that resides within
go toe to toe with a panther and you just cant win
suffered fame bats suppressed the rest
the rich get richer and the poor take less
the american dream was an american nightmare
you kept my people down and refuse to fight fair
the klu klux klan tried to keep us out
with signs drew they know no blacks allowed
with intimidation and segregation was a way for our freedom
but now were impatient
blacks the other skin dead or sell outs
freedom equality then ill yell out
dont you ever be ashamed of what you are
its ya panther power that makes you a star
panther power

chorus
panther power
panther power
panther power

tupac
my mother never let me forget my history
hoping i was set free chains never put on me
wanted to be more than just free
had to know the true facts about my history
i couldnt settle for being a statistic
couldnt survive in this capitalistic
government cause it was meant to hold us back
using ignorant drugs to sneak attack
in my community they killed the unity
but when i charged them tried to claim immunity
i strike america like a case of hard disease
panther power is running through my arteries
try to stop oh boy youll be clawed to death
cause ill be fighting for my freedom with my dying breath
do you remember that is what im asking you
you think you living free dont let me laugh at you
open your eyes realize that you have been locked in chains
said you wasnt civilized and stole your name
cause some time has passed seem you all forget
there aint no liberty to you and me we all aint free yet

or the occasional pain
of a man like me who goes against the grain
sometimes i do it in vain
so wit the little bass and treble aint missed a
so its time for me to explain that im the rebel
cold as the devil
straight from the underground the rebel alone laughs
they came to see the maniac sychopath
the critics heard of me and the aftermath
i dont give a damn and it shows
a when i do a stage show i wear street clothes
so they all know me the lyrical lunatic the maniac mc
i give a shout out to your homies
maybe then the criticsll leave your boy alone g
on the streets or on tv it just dont pay the be a truth tellin mc
they wont be happy till im banned
the most dangerous weapon an educated black man
for point blank in your face pump up the bass and join the human race
i throw peace to the bay
cuz from the jungle to oaktown they backin me up all the way
you know ya gotta love the sound
its from the rebel the rebel of the underground

hes the rebel rebel of the underground 4x

2pac
now im face to face with the devil
cuz they breedin more rebels than the whole damn ghetto
and police brutality

and that way they cant stop me

sold yoya-yo to the people in the ghetto
when ya hear the bass roll go ahead and let go
now everybody wanna gangbang
they talkin street slang but the punk still cant hang
by makin records bout violence

my every move is a compilated step
ta bring me closer
to embrace an early death now theres nothing left
there was no mercy on tha streets
i couldnt rest
im barely standing bout to go to pieces screaming peace
and though my soul was deleted i couldnt see it
i had my mind full of demons tryin ta break free
they planted seeds and they hatched sparking tha flame
inside my brain like a match such a dirty game
no memories just misery
painting a picture of my enemies killing me in my sleep
will i survive till tha morning ta see tha sun
please lord forgive me for my sins
cause here i come

chorus

lord
i suffer through tha years
and shed so many tears

in our days things changed
everyones ashamed to the youth cuz the truth looks strange
and for me its reversed we left them a world thats cursed and it hurts
cause any day theyll push the button
and all good men like malcolm x and bobby hunton died for nothin
dont them let me get teary the world looks dreary
but when you wipe your eyes see it clearly
theres no need for you to fear me
if you take the time to hear me maybe you can learn to cheer me
it aint about black or white cuz were human
i hope we see the light before its ruined

living out a bag but shes glad for the little things she has
and over there theres a lady crack got her crazy
guess shes given birth to a baby
i dont trip and let it fade me from outta the frying pan
we jump into another form of slavery
even now i get discouraged
wonder if they take it all back while i still keep the courage
i refuse to be a role model
i set goals take control drink out my own bottle
i make mistakes but learn from every one
and when its said and done
i bet this brotha be a better one
if im upset you dont stress
never forget that god hasnt finished with me yet
i feel his hand on my brain
when i write rhymes i go blind and let the lord do his thang
but am i less holy
cuz i choose to puff a blunt and drink a beer with my homies
before we find world peace
we gotta find peace in that war on the streets
my ghetto gospel

verse 1

black cotton
steady stressin smith and wessons count my blessins
class is in session the worst question is the first question
why do we work like slaves sweatin blades to an early grave
never got paid but still we slave in the nine tre
answer that then answer this too-
loves gonna get ya you know its true lifes a bitch true
you best to backtrack and try to act black and live
not to be phony and positive but why be negative
whats the matter g black cat got your tongue
fat track gotcha sprung now your hung do ya feel me
dum dum diddy is it me
attempt to reach each and every brother on the streets
if not peace then at least lets get a piece
im tired of seeing bodies on the streets- deceased
lookin through my highschool yearbook
reminiscin of the tears as the years took
one homie two homie three homies - poof
we used to have troops but now theres no more youth to shoot
god come save the misbegotten
lost ghetto souls of black cotton in gods eyes

chorus eminem

nobody dont care
no matter how hard i try/look to the sky/and i ask god why
nobody dont care
seems like my dreams/drowned in by screams/no answer to my questions
nobody dont care
feels like im pressed/why do i stress/its like im being tested
nobody dont care
seems like my prayers/vanish to thin air/please answer my questions
nobody dont care

verse 3

in the belly of the beast im bubbling up
running out of luck about to self destruct
old heads say live your life like such
your sure to catch her witcha one day boy
i wouldnt listen to em
your power movement was cool
but it aint fix nothin
so i just go with what i know
i dont trust none
look what the 80s did
to whats bebes kids
and now we grown up
nobody aint own us yet

verse 4

black cotton im plottin on what they owe me
im workin without a profit
they shacklin all my homies
im hurtin but keep the mind
and we aint stop its cutains you try to rise and
certainly we survive with outlaw ridas
whats the reward for a strugala
if the lord lovin us then why they hate to see us comin up
runnin up gun cocked like nasty gloves
if you aint got a penny mind the glove
no love
waitin for my 40 acas and a blunt to blaze
biblicle times good hearts with milita minds
black cotton - im hoppin over enemy lines
black cotton - i aint stoppin till they givin me mine

as soon as i leave the house you wanna page me
see you got me trapped im going crazy this is slavery
you act like its outrageous give me space it wont get better
and maybe we will argue and be through with all these sorry letters
soon as i come home its like i get the third degree
where ya been and who you with i get no room to breathe
it makes me wanna leave
im sick of these tricks up your sleeve
your suspicious i deceive give me grief without belief but to me
if you really trust me then its pitiful
question me about my whereabouts thats so trivial
let me live my life and you can live yours
just be there to help me and support thats what your here for
not to give me stress and add to pressure
home is where i go the rest i go to pass the test
im sorry if i left you all alone
but i couldnt make it home so we argue on the phone
dont you trust me

chorus

callin up my house to hang it up you think that makes sense
tell me what it takes for us to shake so we can be friends
its time for us to take our separate paths
we had a lot of laughs but the good things come to pass
lets make it an even break dont make it scandalous
try to be mature im pretty sure that we can handle this
youre saying im too busy i ignore you
i guess you didnt hear me when i said that i cared for you
but now it seems the arguments are nightly
i wanna hold you tightly but instead you wanna fight me
so why let it stress and aggravate me
instead id rather break hope you dont hate me
you tell me that you love me but your lyin
fighting back the urge to start cryin
i wipe away your tears come and hug me
i love you like you love me
girl dont you trust me

chorus

i hangup the phone click
i cant bare to hear you yellin at me
maybe we should end it neither one of us are happy
you know that im emotional you milk me
comin over crying just to get me feelin guilty
you and me were met to be it yet
you always wanna sweat and how much closer can we get dont fret
just let me pack my things and ill be outie
this time im breaking out you let your mouth overcrowd me
i cant take the beefin and the griefin
i get no room to sleep i hope it ceases cause im leavin
maybe next time youll be a little more sure
when i can give you more when you unsure
but baby until then i gotta leave ya
its not that i dont need ya but see ya
and i hope that you understand why i bust it
not because we rushed it hell no
but girl dont you trust me

court cases got a nigga facing multiple digits 
dodging cop cars look how we come so far 
picture a high school drop out 
rolling a double r 
house full of happiness weed and drank 
way out 
so when trouble tried to find me cant 
never visioned living longer than my twenty first 
thought id locked down cracked out or in the dirt 
and though it hurts to see the change 
it comes with the fame 
watch them gossip in this silly game 
to all the motherfuckers speaking down on me this is the night 
whys everybody caught up in pacs life

conversating on my life

and so i pull it out my pocket let it rain you see

but he wont be layin up in my casket or doin life in the can for me

walking dead angels spend their last days by me
new jersey giant like dave tyree
young george or jonathan chat

soldier like geronimo pratt
and come through cockin tha black pound
when they put the twin towers up pac im knockin em back down
poster child
air force ones with the checks

its full of judges and chasin enemies in the night
through the henny i see the eyes of the devil
hes ridin with extra boxes of bullets and a nina and a shovel

this god given he keep givin me better music

broke niggas always telling you how to make your cash and just

red dotted the media they always mad at us
i dont see them trying to mediate when they get they gats and bust

and my niggas locked as soon as they get the case
personally i aint tripping on all that rapping stuff
im taking back my money counters wasnt fast enough

and none of them is money
and pretend they love me and say they buddies
sometimes i want to mauve with the ruger

the media they always asking me what my passion is and
money talks to i always have voice to answer this
i cant relax cause its like im a fetty activist

started with five shots niggas plotting to kill him 
never figured that that same nigga sell five million 
hit the charts like a mad man nothing but hits 
court cases got a nigga facing multiple digits 
dodging cop cars look how we come so far 
picture a high school drop out 
rolling a double r 
house full of happiness weed and drank 
way out 
so when trouble tried to find me cant 
never visioned living longer than my twenty first 
thought id locked down cracked out or in the dirt 
and though it hurts to see the change 
it comes with the fame 
watch them gossip in this silly game 
to all the motherfuckers speaking down on me this is the night 
whys everybody caught up in pacs life 
to all yall niggas 
conversating on my life 
mind your motherfucking business

talking loud out of pocket tryna bang with me 
and so i pull it out my pocket let it rain you see

leaving no trace they see my face and then they buried

pressures three strikes i hope they dont test us
so pull the heat out ammunition in crates shh
move without a sound as we slide down pistols in place
im sensing niggas is defenceless im hitting fences then getting ghost
who can prevent me shooting senseless
at these niggas throats
bitch made niggas and that bullshit you going through
outlaws busting while we rushing
we untouchable
fuck you niggas and that bullshit you going through
we outlaws rushing you busting you
we untouchable

makaveli the don got niggas strapped and ready to bomb
as soon as i send the alarm and when were done
weve committed a red rum leaving the enemies dead and gone
leaving em niggas heads blown cause they know they dead wrong
when the shots ring out you know were coming through know were coming through
talk a lot with your mouth well what you gon do so what you gon do
shut em down busters be knowing to keep they distance

only wish to breed

niggas screaming peace cause they fear when my squad face em

murder motherfuckers at a rate and then quicken the pace
blast me but never ask me to live a lie
am i wrong cause i wanna get it on till i die
westcoast

niggas gossip like girls then hide
no offence to nas but this whole fucking world is mine
even if you blind you can still see my prophecy
my destiny to overthrow those on top of me
fiending for currency the money be calling
can you feel me dreaming
seeing scenes of me balling
fuck you bitch made niggas and that bullshit you going through
outlaws busting while we rushing
we untouchable
fuck you niggas and that bullshit you going through
we outlaws rushing you busting you
we untouchable
