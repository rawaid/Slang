the only thing that im carvin is an alley cat 
but sometimes in the daytime 
i daydream of a manwich

a yo its cold on this level cause its twice as deep 
but you dont hear me ignorance is bliss and so on 
sometimes its better to be thought dumb 
shall i go on 
you dont want no real what the deal is a mystery 
how is it i can live and make history 
if you dont see it then it wasnt ment for you to see 
if you wasnt born wit it then it wasnt ment for you to be 
but you cant blame me for not wantin to be hound 
lock down in a cell wit a soul gettin dwelled 
this is hell go get the devil and get me the key 
but cant be worst than the curse that was given ta me 
its what i live for you take away that and im gone 
theres a difference between doin wrong and being wrong 
and that aint right 
just keep it fair baby 
put me in the year and ill take it there baby 
yes 

either let me fly or give me death 
let my soul rest take my breath 
if i dont fly ima die anyway ima live on 
but ill be gone any day

either let me fly or give me death 
let my soul rest take my breath 
if i dont fly ima die anyway ima live on 
but ill be gone any day

im a flow regardless because im an artist until im trapped 
ima continue to hit the hardest whether i scrap or rap 
give me death but you aint my friend 
i see it in your eyes you contemplate my end 
you waitin for that bend in the road where you were told 
that you would go when you were old 
and if you died young it was told 
so what the dilly what it was worth 
think back 26 years be like what of his birth 
what if it was a miscarriage and i never existed 
have i given something that have been taken away you 
would of missed it 
didnt know did i persistedÂ  
it was the call of the wild 
im here to say whats in my heart and you call it a style 
dont put it in the cage dont mistreat it 
you say you hunger for knowledge here it is eat it 
another song completed is another thought captured 
let me do my thing i got it locked wit this rap shit 

either let me fly or give me death 
let my soul rest take my breath 
if i dont fly ima die anyway ima live on 
but ill be gone any day

either let me fly or give me death 
let my soul rest take my breath 
if i dont fly ima die anyway ima live on 
but ill be gone any day

or give me death uh uh uh or take my breath

lotta niggas i let ride but its not in my plans 
an a lot of my mans is not seein through the fog 
families by the truckloads fleein to the morgue 
full moon arooooo the howlin errrrrrr 
the growlin shhhhhh the prowlin 
dont know love cant show love 
that means you gonna need more love 
than on old thug but hold up roll up 
talkin out the side of your mouth is 
whats gonna is whats gonna let niggas know 
why you died in your house why they lied to your spouse 
told her it was suicide but you an i 
both know the truth will never die
listen nigga if you scared get a dog but be prepared for the mob 
cuz you dead up in the fog an thats your head by the log 
i can smell it in the air i can tell when its there 
this is hell an we both here 
can you feel it tell me yeah 

i remember i remember dont worry how could i ever forget its the first time the last time we ever met but i know the reason why you keep your silence up no you dont fool me the hurt doesnt show but the pain still grows its no stranger to you or me

i can feel it comin in the air tonight oh lord 
ive been waitin for this moment for all my life 
oh lord oh lord

arf arf 
haha 
aroo arro 
whoo whoo whooooi come to you hungry and tired you give food and let me sleep
i come to you weak you give strength and thats deep
you called me a sheep and lead me to green pastures
only asking that i keep the focus in between the chapters

you give me the word and only ask i interpret
and give me the eyes that i can recognize the serpent
you know i aint perfect but youd like me to try
unlike the devil who just wants me to lie till i die

lord why is it that i go through so much pain
all i saw was black and all i felt was rain
i come to you because its you who knows
you showed me that everything is black because my eyes were closed

you gave me the light and let me bask in your glory
so it was only right that when you asked for this story
i put together to do our dogs some good
our dogs being brothers and sisters in the hood

plenty of times you sent help my way but i hid
and i remember once you held me close but i slid
there was something that i just had to see
that you wanted me to see so i can be what you wanted me to be

and i think ive seen it cause i dont feel the same
matter of fact i know i have seen it i can feel the change
and its strange almost got me beating down your door
but ive never known love like this before

its a wonderful feeling to get away from the pain
and up under the ceiling i get away from the rain
and the strain that i feel when im here is gone
i know real so i wipe away the tears with a song

and i almost lost faith when you when you took my man
monty paso and jays brother dan
and i fear that what i saying wont be heard until im gone
but its all good cause i really didnt expect to live long

so if it takes for me to suffer for my brother to see the light
give me pain till i die but please lord treat him rightyou tell me that theres love here 
but to me its blatant 
nothin but all the blood here 
im dealin with satan 
plus with all the hatin 
its hard to keep peace uh huh 
thou shall not steal 
but i will to eat 
i tried doin good but 
goods not too good for me 
misunderstood 
why you chose the hood for me 
me im aiight 
i just had to work hard at it 
went to grama for answers 
she told me that god had it 
so now here i am 
confused and full of questions 
am i born to lose 
or is this just a lesson 
and who its goin choose 
when it gets turned around 
and will it be 
layin in my own blood 
and on the ground 

my child 
ive watched you grow up 
and ive been there uh huh 
even at those times 
you least suspected it 
i was there 
and look at what ive given you 
a talent to rhyme 
i may not come when you call 
but im always on time 

somebodys knockin 
should i let em in 
lord were just startin 
but where will it end 
somebodys knockin 
should i let em in 
lord were just startin 
but where will it end 
but when the funds are low 
the gunsll blow 
lookin for that one that owe 
make em run that dough 

no 
put down the guns 
and write a new rhyme 
youll get it all in due time 
youll do fine 
just have faith 
cuz you mine uh huh 
and when you shine 
its goin be a sight to behold 
so dont fight to be old 
or lose sight when its cold 
see that light down the road 
its goin guide you there 
two sets of footprints 
i was right beside you there 

but what about them times i 
only saw one 
those were the times that i was 
under the gun 

it was then i carried you my son 
led you to safety 
it just wasnt your time to face me uh huh 

ayo a few of them times i thought you would erase me 
but all you did was embrace me 
prepared me for the worst 
offered me eternal light 
and scared me with the hearse 
and the curse 
turned to grace 
when the hurt 
turned to faith 
no more runnin uh huh 
and slidin in the dirt 
cuz im safe 

somebodys knockin 
should i let em in 
lord were just startin 
but where will it end 
somebodys knockin 
should i let em in 

so if im yo man 
im in yo hand 
wus yo plan 
never had a friend 
cuz you couldnt trust your man 
learned to stand before i crawled 
things were twisted 
and if you showed me anything at all 
then i missed it 
looked the wrong way uh huh 
ive done some wrong things true 
kept a bad attitude 
but thats what wrong brings 
and now you mean to tell me that 
after all this time 
it was you that kept the dog from goin out of his mind 
it was you that breathed life 
into my lungs when i was born 
and it was you that let me know 
what was right 
from what was wrong 
and it was you that let me do 
what i knew what could be done 
and it was you that gave me a good wife 
and a beautiful son 
and its been you speakin to me 
inside my mind 
and its been you who has forgiven 
time after time 
it was you who opened my eyes 
so i could see 
and it was you who shined yo 
light on meyo ayo lets get papers and pop mo with holes up in skyscrapers

where you going where you going
where you going where you going

if i dont know where im coming from
where would i go
if i dont know where im coming from
where would i go
if i dont know where im coming from
where would i go
if i dont know where im coming from
where would i go

places that ive have been things that i have seen
what you call a nightmare are what i have as dreams
bad as that may seem i know is only going to get worse
love a slug which one am i gonna get first
my journeys been a rough one im not sure when it begins
but the way its looking i kind of know when its gonna end
hold me down baby its gonna be a rough ride
niggas give us plenty of room cause i guess enough died
let me travel cause my intentions are to travel in peace
fuck around i lay you down you hit the gravel and cease
i could be a beast or i could be a gentleman
but if you aint my dog you gonna be like oh its him again
niggas will never win this whole rap game is mine
hot as you ever been i was that in eighty nine
seek and you shall find look within and you will know
where you coming from and where you gotta go
come on

if i dont know where im coming from
where would i go
if i dont know where im coming from
where would i go
-got to keep it real with me
if i dont know where im coming from
where would i go
-so the hell with you
if i dont know where im coming from
where would i go
-i think im going to the top
me and dmx

i will spend mad time in one spot plotting my next move
trying to figure out what is it that x do what x do
some questions go unanswered thats what im afraid of
sometimes i cant show but i know what im made of
they made love or should i say they made lust
bound there didnt have to be love there but they made us
i got quite a few sisters i was the only boy
but being with my dog was my only joy
like a kid with a new toy i forgot about theÂ 
escaped the misery didnt think about the crime
lost all track of time was in another world
everybody knew earl but there was another earl
like the side of the dark riding the park but wouldnt want to
when they jump me became a good runner
one by one they all went under so i had the last laugh
they all thought it all was a joke but i had the last laugh

ha ha ha ha ha ha
come on

if i dont know where im coming from
where would i go
-if i dont know i dont know
if i dont know where im coming from
where would i go
-but i know where im going
if i dont know where im coming from
where would i go
-but i know where im going
if i dont know where im coming from
where would i go
-do you know do you know

i feel the ghost from within coming back to haunt me
stay love in my peoples even though they dont want me
when i was bad i was forgotten like i was dead and rotten
shouldve been getting love but instead was plotting
shit wasnt right and it was all blamed on me
didnt know that i was special till this rap shit came to be
gave me a way out showed me it was better to teach
than bust niggas with the fo-fo leave them dead in the streets
over beef that was worth less than the cost of the slugs
that i bought to kill them
and thats because i thought i ought to kill them
little did i know death wasnt right
didnt always show every breath was a life
it was to be captured in suspended animation
to be felt by all understood by every nation
whats the sense of hating when i can show love
whats the sense of faking when i can show blood

now whats the moral to this story

come on

if i dont know where im coming from
where would i go
if i dont know where im coming from
where would i go
-if i dont know i dont know
if i dont know where im coming from
where would i go
-but i know where im coming from
if i dont know where im coming from
where would i go
-do you know where youre coming from

let us pray
i thank you lord for my birth and everything thats followed
i thank you lord for today and i will pray for tomorrow
i thank you lord for the love of my life and a friend
i made a promise and im loving my wife to the end
i thank you lord for your guidance cause its all that counts
and right here right now lord this is your house
i thank you lord for a dream that came true to light
and i ask you to bless everybody in this room tonight
i dont always do the right thing and i ask you to forgive me
cause i need you here with me without you in my life its empty
i think back how some people did me like violence was the remedy
and because i think of that now i pray for my enemy
not because of what ill do but because they dont know
theres something better after here but everybody wont go
so i ask you to forgive them and well hope they see
and i thank you for the love that theyve given to me
i will not abuse it nor will i lead them astray
you see i love them like children that i see everyday
and i pray no we pray together
get us through the bad weather and well love you forever
let your thought and my heart go hand in hand
i first thought but to start but i stand a man
and for as long as i can as long as you permit me
please give me the strength i need to live bear with me
amen

we each walk the path that weve chosen

sometimes i think all you doing me is just listen
i thought that i was special
thats what you told me
hold me
stop acting like you dont know me
what i do so bad that it sent you away from me
not only sent you away but made you stay away from me
my child im here as ive always been it was you who went away
and now are back again what did i say

all you gotta do is knock 
ya see i left home a boy i returned as a man 
full grown and im still not able to stand 
i gave you a hand 
wellbut i was looking the wrong way 
figured out the plan then i started to pray 
and that prayer took me from here to over there 
back to over here 
now they got me like where 
do i belong 
do i fit in 
things on my mind where do i begin 
its easier to sin but it hurts my heart 
im really tryin to win so where do we start 
thou shall not steal 
but what if he stole from me 
thou shall not kill 
but what if hes tryin to kill me 
thou shall not take my name in vain no matter how hard it rains 
withstand the pain

not scared anymore to lose my life in the war 
after what i just saw im ridin with the lord 
cause i really cant afford to lose my head by the sword 
and now that ive seen what i need to see 
please take me where i need to be 
what have you learned 
its better to tell the truth than to lie 
what have you learned 
to love my life until i die 
what have you learned 
violence isnt always the key 
what have you learned 
you cant always believe what you see 
what have you learned 
its better to forgive and forget 
what have you learned 
give as you expect to get 
what have you learned 
that i cant go on without you 
what have you learned 
i mustve been a fool to ever doubt you

lookin for the bus to bring in my man from up north 
been like three years since when got knocked 
since he got caught 
punked up like five new blocks holding down for it 
kept a nigga straight with money in the books 
and them bitches is crooks who look out for other crooks 
took him shopping money in his pocket is straight 
dropped him off at the wifes crib after we ate 
our estate was the next move for me 
had to make that nigga chill for at least two to three months 
cause when its on its on thats my plate
he didnt care 
its like slow down baby 
the money aint going nowhere what
keep in touch though and show how much your ass is with it 
the dope flow is there and in a minute you can get it

cause on the low we may just be trying to go go down against the grain 

i gots to make a move and make it soon uh-huh
i gots to take a block and make it boom come on
i gots to make a move and make it soon what
i gots to take a block and make it boom come on

i never figured this nigga would pull this shit that he pulled 
what is strange is the change that niggaz go through 
when theyre locked down and really cant hack it 
a motherfucker like me handles a bid like a jacket 
strap it on my back niggaz aint built like me 
and by the end niggaz was like yo why you killed mike d
wasnt me but yeah he had it coming to him 
used to be my man so i let my cousin do him we open up shop its four in the mornin
sent him out of state with like half a brick down to my spot in va 
cause the money comes quick 
half of that got fucked up before i even got the check in on him
but things happen so i really wasnt wreckin on him 
got him up out of there and sent him down a little further 
aint heard from him in two months murder murder aahhh
and from the next flight thinking i might have to steal something 
this hungry shit will make a nigga wanna kill something fo-fo 

i gots to make a move and make it soon uh-huh
i gots to take a block and make it boom come on
i gots to make a move and make it soon what
i gots to take a block and make it boom come on

man listen money is missing and shit is hectic 
found the safe checked it 
shit looks detected

asked around but aint nobody heard from him cash long
but money talks and most niggaz is snakes 
so it wasnt long before his man was ready to take 
me to where he was at checked my gat 
threw in a four clip pumped myself up 
cause i cant go for that bullshit  
fuckin with my last load of cash aint the issue 
its just real fucked up when your man tries to diss you 
takin back for niggaz in new york and how they told me so 
now i got to knock his boots he owes me dough 
layin up with a hoe then he hit me with the sob story
the famous oh you didnt know i got robbed story
told its to me he should be grateful to 
fuck that bitch look at what she made you do 
now theres love lost and a double cross 
pointed at that bitch turned her braids into sauce 
so you wanna be with him uh and talk to me like im silly
five bottle of mo on the floor boxes of phillys

of course you did so dont lie because you could out there and straight bust it chump
now what 
you know what im sayin now thats what mutherf**kers that have to rewind on they tapedeck
yah mean catch it if you can baby spellbound{verse 1}
cause of my  and affection i place nothing above em
 that im possessing i  truly love em
short ones tall ones big ones small ones
winter spring summer and fall yo i love em all
especially the cuties with the smooth complexions and shapely booties
with the type of bodies thatll make you say oh boy
yup but baby if youre ugly i aint got nothing for ya 
im not conceited im convinced that ive been naturally blessed
to  and irresistible with 
and whats that get that breaks down  a cutie i bag em
the instant i see a cutie with a bootie wiggle it just like jello
to me being a player approach and say hello but she didnt hear me
so i tapped her softly she turned around screaming on me back up off me
i said damn there is no need for hostility im a mellow type of fellow
instil the tranquillity she said i recognize all of yall are the same only after one thing
and kinda swift with the game i said come on now sweetheart do i look like a player
she said of course not psych  let me know the deal i wanna ask you
are you for real are you really for real is this love that i cant believe the way you make me feel
are you for real as real as it gets my name is not james brown but i believe you in a cold sweat
and i bet theres no if ands and maybes when im finished i will have you sayin do me baby
she said  ima give you a try because i think your kinda fly and youre my type of guy
she said her name was crystal and she kept the pistol on her and if i ever cheated
believe i be a goner so i played the perfect gentleman ever time i was wit her
and when i wasnt wit her i was going to get her when i wasnt going to get her she was coming to get me
then when she wasnt coming to get me she was wit me
so for a while everything was smooth i waited and contemplated my next move
my instinct had told that the time was right for us to get together
for a magical night so i called her she said hello i said hey
she said wait i already know what you have to say she said baby i know youre wondering
why i wont go over to your place because im not too sure about how you feel
so id rather go at my own pace oh i dont know
the way that i feel im so afraid of a one night deal
i-- hold up sweetheart just chill relax your telling me the answer
and i didnt even ask dont you think that we should be alone this is not the type of thing to
talk about over the phone why dont you come on and go with me
come on over to my place where we can sit down and talk about it face to face
why dont you come on and go with me
come on over to my place
where we can discuss the  of picking up the pace she said
i thought about it and i think that your right but my parents are home so
it wont be tonight but um why dont you come over tomorrow at 8 my parents leave at 730 and wont be back until late
i said then let me go and get set tomorrow will be a day that you will not forget
so the next day around 754 i picked up like 6 condoms and headed for the door stepped outside
i was asked where was i going by detectives with nine millimetres that were showing
i said to my girls house they said no you arent i said why not
they said because they have a warrant
i said thats impossible how can that be they said its right here
robbery first degree well anyway to make a long story short i ended up in 
going to court so i call crystal the night around 8 i said its just a mix up
and blamed it on fate she told me that she loved me and promised to wait she said ill see you in court
on your next court date despite being locked up things werent bad
i still had my girl and for that i was glad
she always came to visit didnt mind the  and every night i wrote a letter telling her things like

{bridge}
i cant feel myself i dont want nobody else to ever love me
you are my shining star my guiding light my love 
theres not a minute hour day or night that i dont love you
youre at the top of my lips cause im always thinking of you
i still remember in the days when i was scared to touch you
how i spent my daydreaming learning how to say i love you
you mustve known that i had feelings deep enough to swim in
thats when you opened up your heart and you told me to come in
oh mama
a thousand kisses from you is never too much
and i just dont wanna stop

{verse 2}
days turned into weeks weeks into months
10 days to 25th and ive only gotten mail once
what had happened to my love life
why do i feel like ive been stabbed in the back with a knife
i tried to believe i said she loves me she does but deep down
i knew what the scoop really was you see
jody had my girl and now she was gone
just thinking about it had me singing every love song
im thinking to my self how could she do me wrong but its not her fault
i was away for too long i thought i had a girlfriend but now i know better
she told me that she wrote me but i never got the letter
every time i tried to call her nobody was home
and since i had to call collect she put a block on the phone
she told me she would visit but damn i havent seen her
you wanna know why because jody is in between her legs and getting busy
he even ate the coochie yo i bought her everything from fendi to gucci
but  in something that i didnt even have to sweat her 
and if it doesnt happen by now its gonna get her um

{bridge}
thrown up in the middle i dont know what to do
what do you do when your girl is untrue
theres another man another man
in my life in my life
ohh another man is beating my time
another man is loving mine
ohh another man is beating my time
another man is loving mine

{verse 3}
beating my time
another man was loving mine
i was upset but there were other things on my mind
i would start trial soon and was facing a lot of time
and on the day of trial i was nervous for a while but when they said not guilty
i stepped with a smile back to freedom freedom on the streets again
where i had to go and see what was up with my friend
so i called her just to make sure she was home i said hello
and a mans voice answered the phone i was confused at first i didnt know what to do
said who is this he said its jody and what is it to you
i turned up the receiver picked up my gun and straight for crystals crib
i started running murder murder my fingers on the trigger murder murder
ima murder this nigga so then i thought why should i do him he wouldnt have no pussy if she didnt give it to him
i thought about killing him thought about it twice said nah
why because it wouldnt be nice and for the sake of curiosity i had to go see crystal
and ask her why did it have to be me i knocked on the door and just like before
i heard a mans voice saying he couldnt take it any more the door opened up
but jody  he looked me up and down and said i guess 
now here comes crystal yelling and fussing hollering screaming shouting and cussing
she looked at me and  got quiet in the hall she  and why didnt you call
i turned around to leave and she said please dont go i said you used to be my girl
now youre nothing but a hoe i understand cause im a man but theres no  in stake
so i spread my wings and fly away yeah

we dont give a fuck fucklet us pray 
lord jesus it is you who wakes me up every day 
and i am forever grateful for your love 
 this is why i pray 
you let me touch so many people and its all for the good 
i influenced so many children i never thought that i would 
and i couldnt take credit for the love they get because it all comes from you lord; 
im just the one thats givin it 
and when it seems like the pressure gets to be too much 
i take time out and pray and ask that you be my crutch 
lord i am not perfect by a longshot -- i confess to you daily 
but i work harder everyday and i hope that you hear me 
in my heart i mean well but if youll help me to grow 
then what i have in my heart will begin to show 
and when i get goin im not lookin back for nothin 
cause i will know where im headed cause im so tired of the sufferin 
i stand before you a weakened version of your reflection 
beggin for direction for my soul needs resurrection 
i dont deserve what youve given me but you never took it from me 
because i am grateful and i use it and i do not worship money 
if what you want from me is to bring your children to you 
my regret is only having one life to do it instead of two 
amenwhat good is it for a man to gain the world yet lose his own soul in the process

god loves you yes he does
said youre alright with him
i wonder

i know you never seen him but dont fight with him
youre gonna make it through the night to the light with him
cause youre alright with him
i said youre alright with him

i know you never seen him but dont fight with him
youre gonna make it through the night to the light with him
cause youre alright with him
i said youre alright with him

im callin out to you lord because i need your help
see once again im havin difficulty savin myself
behavin myself you told me what to do and i do it
but every and now and then gets a little harder to go through it

losin friends day by day
im in so much pain when im here lord please take me away
i put you here to do a job and your work aint done
to live is to suffer but youre still my son

and there will be a time when youll shine as bright as the stars
but there wont be a his or hers just ours
then youll see what ive been tryin to show you all these years
do the right thing; cause after the tears come the cheers

i will my lord with my heart and my soul
thats gonna be how i roll from now until i mold
lead and ill follow you take away the sorrow
ima sleep on what you said and holla back tomorrow

i know you never seen him but dont fight with him
youre gonna make it through the night to the light with him
cause youre alright with him
i said youre alright with him

i know you never seen him but dont fight with him
youre gonna make it through the night to the light with him
youre alright with him
i said youre alright with him

i want you to know lord that for what youve given me im thankful
sincerely from the bottom of my heart im grateful
you gave us power in our words so i think before i speak
and that way when i speak they know im here to teach

cant tell em nothin wrong cause i love em too much
i reach a lot of people and lord im lovin the touch
but deep inside ive got somethin thats workin against
everything i know is right what i know makes sense

thats when you must fight harder than youve ever fought before
cause what youve got goin on inside you is a war
between good and evil be careful of those who wanna be you
they smile but are not really happy when they see you

be careful of the ones that always wanna get you high
cause when the time comes that onell let you die
listen to me im here but i can only help you
if you want me to help what do you want for yourself

i know you never seen him but dont fight with him
youre gonna make it through the night to the light with him
cause youre alright with him
i said youre alright with him

i know you never seen him but dont fight with him
youre gonna make it through the night to the light with him
cause youre alright with him
i said youre alright with him

my lord my savior dont judge my behavior
but instead take whats in my heart and put it in my head
see i guess i really never knew how proud i made you
my life is yours my soul i gave you

i dont know if ill do good enough hes by your side
and we both know the hood is rough right by your side
sometimes i dont know what to do x dry your eyes
but i know what i gotta do itll be alright

you keep givin me the word and ill put it to song
talk to me ill talk to them and we cant go wrong
this is the start of somethin strong and this is just the start of it
praises to you my lord for lettin me be a part of it

i was that kid that been there did that
became ashamed so i hid that but aint no longer with that
use me as an example if i can do it then they can too
with the lord behind us there aint nothin that we cant do

i know you never seen him but dont fight with him
youre gonna make it through the night to the light with him
cause youre alright with him cause he loves you
i said youre alright with him

i know you never seen him but dont fight with him
youre gonna make it through the night to the light with him
cause youre alright with him cause he loves you
i said youre alright with him

a motherfucker like me handles a bid like a jacket 
strap it on my back niggaz aint built like me 
and by the end niggaz was like yo why you killed mike d 
wasnt me but yeah he had it coming to him 
used to be my dog so i let my cousin do him 
sent him out of state with like half a brick down to my spot in va 
cause the money comes quick 
half of that got fucked up before i even got the check in on him damn 
but things happen so i really wasnt wreckin on him damn 
got him up out of there and sent him down a little further 
aint heard from him in two months murder murder 
and from the next flight thinking i might have to steal something 
this hungry shit will make a nigga wanna kill something come on 

listen money is missing and its hectic what 
found the safe checked it 
shit looks detected what 
just what i expected when i got no word from him 
asked around but aint nobody heard from him uh-huh 
but money talks and most niggaz is snakes 
so it wasnt long before his man was ready to take 
me to where he was at checked my gat 
threw in a four clip pumped myself up 
cause i cant go for that bullshit come on 
fuckin with my last load of cash aint the issue 
its just real fucked up when your man tries to diss you 
takin back for niggaz in new york and how they told me so 
now i got to knock his boots he owes me dough 
layin up with a hoe then he hit me with the sob story come on 
the famous oh you didnt know i got robbed story come on 
told its to me he should be grateful to 
fuck that bitch look at what she made you do 
now theres love lost and a double cross 
pointed at that bitch turned her braids into sauce 
so you wanna be with him uh and talk to me like im silly yeah 
five bottle of mo on the floor boxes of phillys uh 
ten gs in the shoebox under the bed 
and for every g i put a fuckin slug in his head 
and from then the moral of the story if you missed it 
is the grand is always gonna be there 
just never go against it 

cant stop 
gotta eat 
stepping on my feet 
spread love think its sweet

at what it took for me to get there
first came the howll the drama with my mama
she got on some fly shit what til i split
and said that ima be that seed
that doesnt need much to succeed
strapped with mad greed and a heart that doesnt bleed
im ready for the world or at least i thought i was
baggin uhh when i caught a buzz
for thinking about how short i was
going too fast it wouldnt last but yo i couldnt tell
group homes and institutions prepare my ass for jail
they put me in a situation forcin me to be a man
when i was just learnin to stand without a helpin hand
damn was it my fault somethin i did
to make a father leave his first kid at 7 doin my first bid
back on the scene at 14 with a scheme
to get more cream than id ever seen in a dream
and by all means i will be living high off the hog
and i never gave a what about much but my dog
thats my only howll i had offered my last
just another little come on headed nowhere fast

ay yo im slippin im fallin i cant get up
ay yo im slippin im fallin i cant get up
ay yo im slippin im fallin i gots to get up
get me back on my feet so i can tear shit up

that aint the half arf gets worse as i get older
actions become bolder heart got colder
chip on my shoulder that i dared a uhh to touch
didnt need a click cause i scared a uh huh that much
one deep went to &lt;edited&gt; for kicks
catchin vicks throwin bricks gettin by bein slick
used to get high to get by used to have to howl
in the morning before i get fly
i ate something a couple of forties made me hate somethin
i did some arf now im ready to take something
3 years later showing signs of stress
didnt keep my hair cut or give a come on how i dressed
im possessed by the darker side livin the cruddy life
what like this kept a nigga with a bloody knife
wanna make records but im wheeewd up
im slippin im fallin i cant get up

ay yo im slippin im fallin i cant get up
ay yo im slippin im fallin i cant get up
ay yo im slippin im fallin i gots to get up
get me back on my feet so i can tear shit up

wasnt long before i hit rock bottom

sayin to myself that couldve been yo &lt;edited&gt; on the tv
believe me it could be done somethins got to give
its got to change cause ive got a son
ive got to do the right thing for shorty
and that means no more getting high drinking forties
so i get back lookin type slick again

and much respect to all my come on that kept it real

uhh who they is and this is yo what uhh song
and to my boo who stuck with a arf through
all the bullshit youll get yours because its due

ay yo im slippin im fallin i cant get up
ay yo im slippin im fallin i cant get up
ay yo im slippin im fallin i gots to get up
get me back on my feet so i can tear shit up

cant get upi gots to get up
this is from the heart baby dont get it twisted
ahh x ratedi come to you hungry and tired you give me food and let me sleep
i come to you weak you give me strength and thats deep
you call me a sheep and lead me to green pastures
only asking that i keep the focus in between the chapters
you give me the word and only ask that i interpret
and give me the eyes that i may recognize the serpent
you know i aint perfect but youd like me to try
unlike the devil who just wants me to lie till i die
lord why is it that i go through so much pain
all i saw was black  all i felt was rain
i come to you because its you who knows
you showed me that everything was black because my eyes were closed
you gave me the light and let me bask in your glory
so it was only right that when you ask for this story
i put it together to do our dogs some good
our dogs being brothers and sisters in the hood
plenty of times you sent help my way but i hid
and i remember once you held me close but i slid
there was something that i just had to see
that you wanted me to see so i could be what you wanted me to be
and i think ive seen it cause i dont feel the same
matter of fact i know ive seen it i can feel the change
and its strange almost got me beating down your door
but ive never known love like this before
its a wonderful feeling to get away from the pain
and up under the ceiling i get away from the rain
and the strain that i feel when im here is gone
i know real so i wipe away the tears with a song
and i almost lost faith when you took my man
monty paso and jays brother dan
and i fear that what im saying wont be heard until im gone
but its all good cause im really didnt expect to live long
so if it takes for me to suffer for my brother to see the light
give me pain till i die
but please lord treat him right[talking]
let us pray
i thank you lord for my birth and everything thats followed
i thank you lord for today and i will pray for tomorrow
i thank you lord for the love of my life and a friend
i made a promise and im loving my wife to the end
i thank you lord for your guidance cause its all that counts
and right here right now lord this is your house
i thank you lord for a dream that came true to light
and i ask you to bless everybody in this room tonight
i dont always do the right thing and i ask you to forgive me
cause i need you here with me without you in my life its empty
i think back how some people did me like violence was the remedy
and because i think of that now i pray for my enemy
not because of what ill do but because they dont know
theres something better after here but everybody wont go
so i ask you to forgive them and well hope they see
and i thank you for the love that theyve given to me
i will not abuse it nor will i lead them astray
you see i love them like children that i see everyday
and i pray no we pray together
get us through the bad weather and well love you forever
let your thought and my heart go hand in hand
i first thought but to start but i stand a man
and for as long as i can as long as you permit me
please give me the strength i need to live bear with me
amen

we each walk the path that weve chosen

thats somethin new to me so im askin you for time to adjust
let me make it there i will be one you can trust
what i stand for i put my life on i do
i guess what im askin is - show me how to stand for you
and i will rap for you sing for you preach for you teach for you
reach for you - i will love you like you love me unconditionally
and i will always be prepared for whatever the missionll be
give the nutrition to me and ill properly digest it
and when i give it back ill show you word well invested
and whenever i go before i go let me give
thanks to you lord my birth for every day that ive lived

and despite the fact i won all the spelling bees 
on my report card i didnt get fs i got cs 
but for those who choose to snooze

went to liberty island and got stranded with 
the statue of liberty but they really didnt hafta

ribs are showin through my back cause i havent had a meal 
in about a week you can see bones in my hands

the only thing that im carvin is an alley cat 
but sometimes in the daytime

some old born loser type of shit shit 
on the remix tip tip tip 
dr seuss seuss seuss suess 

the born loser not because i choose to be 
but because all the bad shit happens to me 
i got kids but their mothers dont want them to know me 
sisters use to like me but now they call me homie 
use to have a family now im out on my own 
had to scrap with the pitt cause i tried to take his bone 
bitches dont like me they dont kiss me or hug me 
they call me kill-pretty because im mad ugly 
i use to get pussy but i busted off quick 
now i gets none so i gotta beat my dick 
time are hard in the ghetto i steal for a living 
eatin turkey flavored now or laters for thanksgiving
if that aint enough life is rough i swear 
i dont have an address so i cant get welfare 
they kicked me out the shelter 
because they said i smelled a little like the living dead 
and look like helter skelter 
my clothes are so funky they bad for my health 
sometimes at night my pants go to the bathroom by their self 
even when i was little nothin went my way 
i got beat up and chased home from school every day 
and despite the fact i won all the spelling bees 
on my report card i didnt get fs i got cs 
but for those who choose to snooze 
since i was born with no hope i aint got nothin to lose 

young man went out and made a name for himself
young man went out and made a name for himself
young man went out and made a name for himself

check check check it out 

verse 2 

the born loser a title i was branded with 
went to liberty island and got stranded with 
the statue of liberty but they really didnt hafta 
leave my black ass there till the day after 
no time for laughter this shits for real 
ribs are showin through my back cause i havent had a meal 
in about a week you can see bones in my hands 
the racoons beat me to the garbage cans 
im starvin marvin and it shouldnt be like that 
the only thing that im carvin is an alley cat 
but sometimes in the daytime 
i daydream of a manwich 
when all im really eatin is an oxygen sandwich 
for those that dont know 
thats 2 peices of bread slapped together 
or ill have a rain sandwich depending on the weather 
born loser caught up in the game 
and i aint even got nobody to blame 

young man went out and made a name for himself
young man went out and made a name for himself
young man went out and made a name for himself

the born loser yeah that use to be my m o 
when i couldnt get a soul to listen to my demo 
doors shut in my face until i started jammin em 
im behind the doors now but im the one slammin em 
i did what i had to to get where i got 
though ill admit what i had to do was a lot 
i still gave it a shot and sometimes i had to shoot 
catchin vicks just to get a little loot 
i thought it was cute and didnt care who knew 
mess around get in my way and id bag you too 
cause i was born to lose straight from the beginning 
hit the dugout because i struck out the 1st inning 
winning was everything thats why i had to ask 
my man to front me the loot and he said id be glad to 
now who needs a major label we got our own 
im the divine master of the unknown 
aint nothin changed im the same as before 
when opportunity knocks id just answer the door 
but criminal at heart even though i dont show it 
i was always a winner i just didnt know it know it 

young man went out and made a name for himself

some old born loser type of shit shit 
on the remix tip tip tip 
dr seuss seuss seuss suess 

the born loser not because i choose to be 
but because all the bad shit happens to me 
i got kids but their mothers dont want them to know me 
sisters use to like me but now they call me homie 
use to have a family now im out on my own 
had to scrap with the pitt cause i tried to take his bone 
bitches dont like me they dont kiss me or hug me 
they call me kill-pretty because im mad ugly 
i use to get pussy but i busted off quick 
now i gets none so i gotta beat my dick 
time are hard in the ghetto i steal for a living 
eatin turkey flavored now or laters for thanksgiving
if that aint enough life is rough i swear 
i dont have an address so i cant get welfare 
they kicked me out the shelter 
because they said i smelled a little like the living dead 
and look like helter skelter 
my clothes are so funky they bad for my health 
sometimes at night my pants go to the bathroom by their self 
even when i was little nothin went my way 
i got beat up and chased home from school every day 
and despite the fact i won all the spelling bees 
on my report card i didnt get fs i got cs 
but for those who choose to snooze 
since i was born with no hope i aint got nothin to lose 

young man went out and made a name for himself
young man went out and made a name for himself
young man went out and made a name for himself

check check check it out 

verse 2 

the born loser a title i was branded with 
went to liberty island and got stranded with 
the statue of liberty but they really didnt hafta 
leave my black ass there till the day after 
no time for laughter this shits for real 
ribs are showin through my back cause i havent had a meal 
in about a week you can see bones in my hands 
the racoons beat me to the garbage cans 
im starvin marvin and it shouldnt be like that 
the only thing that im carvin is an alley cat 
but sometimes in the daytime 
i daydream of a manwich 
when all im really eatin is an oxygen sandwich 
for those that dont know 
thats 2 peices of bread slapped together 
or ill have a rain sandwich depending on the weather 
born loser caught up in the game 
and i aint even got nobody to blame 

young man went out and made a name for himself
young man went out and made a name for himself
young man went out and made a name for himself

the born loser yeah that use to be my m o 
when i couldnt get a soul to listen to my demo 
doors shut in my face until i started jammin em 
im behind the doors now but im the one slammin em 
i did what i had to to get where i got 
though ill admit what i had to do was a lot 
i still gave it a shot and sometimes i had to shoot 
catchin vicks just to get a little loot 
i thought it was cute and didnt care who knew 
mess around get in my way and id bag you too 
cause i was born to lose straight from the beginning 
hit the dugout because i struck out the 1st inning 
winning was everything thats why i had to ask 
my man to front me the loot and he said id be glad to 
now who needs a major label we got our own 
im the divine master of the unknown 
aint nothin changed im the same as before 
when opportunity knocks id just answer the door 
but criminal at heart even though i dont show it 
i was always a winner i just didnt know it know it 

young man went out and made a name for himself
young man went out and made a name for himself
young man went out and made a name for himself

cause youre alright with him
i said youre alright with him

i know you never seen him but dont fight with him
youre gonna make it through the night to the light with him
cause youre alright with him
i said youre alright with him

im callin out to you lord because i need your help
see once again im havin difficulty savin myself
behavin myself you told me what to do and i do it
but every and now and then gets a little harder to go through it

losin friends day by day
im in so much pain when im here lord please take me away
i put you here to do a job and your work aint done
to live is to suffer but youre still my son

and there will be a time when youll shine as bright as the stars
but there wont be a his or hers just ours
then youll see what ive been tryin to show you all these years
do the right thing; cause after the tears come the cheers

i will my lord with my heart and my soul

i want you to know lord that for what youve given me im thankful
sincerely from the bottom of my heart im grateful
you gave us power in our words so i think before i speak
and that way when i speak they know im here to teach

cant tell em nothin wrong cause i love em too much
i reach a lot of people and lord im lovin the touch
but deep inside ive got somethin thats workin against
everything i know is right what i know makes sense

thats when you must fight harder than youve ever fought before
cause what youve got goin on inside you is a war
between good and evil be careful of those who wanna be you
they smile but are not really happy when they see you

be careful of the ones that always wanna get you high
cause when the time comes that onell let you die
listen to me im here but i can only help you
if you want me to help what do you want for yourself

i know you never seen him but dont fight with him
youre gonna make it through the night to the light with him

i said youre alright with him

i know you never seen him but dont fight with him
youre gonna make it through the night to the light with him
cause youre alright with him
i said youre alright with him

my lord my savior dont judge my behavior
but instead take whats in my heart and put it in my head
see i guess i really never knew how proud i made you
my life is yours my soul i gave you

i dont know if ill do good enough hes by your side
and we both know the hood is rough right by your side
sometimes i dont know what to do x dry your eyes
but i know what i gotta do itll be alright

this is the start of somethin strong and this is just the start of it
praises to you my lord for lettin me be a part of it

i was that kid that been there did that
became ashamed so i hid that but aint no longer with that
use me as an example if i can do it then they can too
with the lord behind us there aint nothin that we cant do

i know you never seen him but dont fight with him
youre gonna make it through the night to the light with him
cause youre alright with him cause he loves you
i said youre alright with him

i know you never seen him but dont fight with him
youre gonna make it through the night to the light with him

from 80 school street to way across town
cats knew how i got down cause word got around
i was that robbery kid with no gun and no mask
catch a nigga out the door slippin thats yo ass
didnt laugh much cause i didnt have much
life was like a stick half gas half clutch
meaning half good and half bad
what was good if i caught a good vic if i didnt i was bad
took it out on my regulars
i come through and if niggaz was broke i took watches and sneakers
went to jail a few times but that didnt stop me
all it taught me was how not to be sloppy
an older cat robbed me when i was like 10
if anybody wanted to help they shouldve did it then
but they didnt and all it did was release the beast
so im a feast on whatever i come across in the streets

like the wind like the wind
god will take god will take
all my sins all of my sins
blown away will be blown away
like the wind like the wind
like the wind like the wind
blooown

i had a s on my chest fuck the vest
did robberies with some cats and robbed the rest
other time i came thought with just me and my dog
and clear out the whole fuck block cause we when hard
i bag some niggaz i knew and some niggaz i didnt
i aint a fuck either way it was no bullshiting
im a cruddy niggaz out to get money
and a couple of slugs is the only thing anybody took from me
run up on a cat smooth like put it in his left ear
give up the money the jewelry or get left here
keep thinking its a game and play lets get popped
see how much fun you having when your heart be stopped
shut em down open up shop oh-oh no-oh blow off a nigga top
somebody call the cops but its to late
cause im a hit you in the face
and what will kill you will be something that you ate

like the wind like the wind
god will take god will take
all my sins all of my sins
blown away will be blown away
like the wind like the wind
like the wind like the wind
blooown

if pain is love why hide my pain with drugs
choke off haze and sell attics coke for days
same clothes and no soup to shave
and i still got a gun on my hip for your open grave
we used to get robbery vics
until my man got killed for his whip on some robbery shit
then i switched to the weed and start selling crack
but i will pull a steel and put a shell up in ya back
i feel like all my life i was held up in a trap
like if i go to heaven maybe hell will want me back
but all i really want is sperwells up an a lap
and a model bitch sitting with a head in my lap
but since no doe dont spin
and my pant hole got hole within i got to fold ya men
its obvious i live in a house of sin
i wish i could open up the door and let em blow at the wind

like the wind
god will take
all my sins
blown away
like the wind
like the wind
blooownlet us pray for those that weve lost
we know that we miss them for selfish reasons
oh lord my god indeed you i put my trust

direction of life was uplifted when the wind shifted
and took a turn for the worse with the blessing come the curse

but that didnt stop fate from happenin
idle time make the devil hate whats happening

ima let life be my song

how i live is simple
walk through the streets
talk to the beats
new york  ima eat
i never had a problem with surviving
no problem with getting down busting my guns or ruff rydin
cats talk slick but i talk slicker
my shits for real cause im that nigga
the reason that you hurtin is you gotta take your problems
straight to the lord no body else can solve them
see what i see but look through my eyes
the devil is a liar the truth never lies
we all got issues
shit that we go thru
shit that we been thru
shit that we wont do
the pain that we bring upon ourself
for no reason is the worst
thats why i say im blessed with the curse
the lord gave it all to me
and in the process i lost my soul
damn the devil got a hold
in my mind im like a little boy
lost in crime
like the healthy nigga that the devil forced into dying
the lord knows im trying
but at the same time
you hear the nigga with the weight of the world
why you gave it to earl

im gonna go hard
whether im right or wrong
till the dead and gone
its on
what yall really want
bring it on
ima let life be my song
im gonna go hard
whether im right or wrong
till the dead and gone
its on
what yall really want
bring it on
ima let life be my song

to live is to suffer
and im living it up
face everyday chin up
i aint giving it up
cause if i aint giving a fuck
the who will
so i hope for the best
knowing that its all uphill
sometimes i wonder whats lifes about
sometimes i wonder why i take the wrong route
then turn around and go out
and no doubt the fate in mine is blind
so whatever fuck it ima roll out
we all go through the motions
we get different notions
we each have our own ocean
that we can either drown or float
like the vessels that we are
vessels that would carry many far
dont know what to say when you talking
dont know who you gone see when you walking
if you dont know how much of what you do is dirt
3 things you dont know gonna get you hurt

nigga

let us pray
father please walk with us through the bad times as well as the good
may we be heard and understood from the suburbs to the hood
may you judge us by our hearts and not by our mistakes
and see that we get a breakthrough however long that it takes
may you fill that void in our souls that will lay our fears to rest
cause there is no way we can live for jesus when were liven in the flesh
so i pray that you allow our sprits to be born
go strong move on know right from wrong

do not love the world or anything in the world and we know what that means
but lessen we know the distance we need to keep away from fire to keep it missing
that doesnt mean well listen
lord you take care of fools and babies
you teach women to honor their men and men respect their ladies
but lately so many of us have gone a stray
doing wrong for so long that weve forgotten the way
please bring us back home and still in us the word witch is our backbone
which is children that act grown
there is so much that were entitled to yet we receive so little
cause in this time of spiritual warfare were comfortable in the middle
so i pray that you open our eyes
give us the unknowing to recognize the devil and his lies
if we keep our actions wise and our prays sincere
our heads to the sky you will demonist our fears
in jesus name we have prayed
amen and amenyeah uh
in the name of jesus spread the word
no weapon formed against me shall prosper preach
and every tongue that rises against me in judgment thou shall condemn preach
lord give me a sign for this is the heritage of the servants of the lord
preach and their righteousness is of me said the lord preach
amen uh
lord give me a sign

gogogogoi come to you hungry and tired you give me food and let me sleep
i come to you weak you give me strength and thats deep
you call me a sheep and lead me to green pastures
only asking that i keep the focus in between the chapters
you give me the word and only ask that i interpret
and give me the eyes that i may recognize the serpent
you know i aint perfect but youd like me to try
unlike the devil who just wants me to lie till i die
lord why is it that i go through so much pain
all i saw was black  all i felt was rain
i come to you because its you who knows
you showed me that everything was black because my eyes were closed
you gave me the light and let me bask in your glory
so it was only right that when you ask for this story
i put it together to do our dogs some good
our dogs being brothers and sisters in the hood
plenty of times you sent help my way but i hid
and i remember once you held me close but i slid
there was something that i just had to see
that you wanted me to see so i could be what you wanted me to be
and i think ive seen it cause i dont feel the same
matter of fact i know ive seen it i can feel the change
and its strange almost got me beating down your door
but ive never known love like this before
its a wonderful feeling to get away from the pain
and up under the ceiling i get away from the rain
and the strain that i feel when im here is gone
i know real so i wipe away the tears with a song
and i almost lost faith when you took my man
monty paso and jays brother dan
and i fear that what im saying wont be heard until im gone
but its all good cause im really didnt expect to live long
so if it takes for me to suffer for my brother to see the light
give me pain till i die
but please lord treat him rightthis is the way its the way its supposed to be
this is the way that i say that its gonna be
this is the way that i say its supposed to be
this is the way that i say that its gonna be

yea uh
from 80 school street to way across town
cats knew how i got down cause word got around
i was that robbery kid with no gun and no mask
catch a nigga out the door slippin thats yo ass
didnt laugh much cause i didnt have much
life was like a stick half gas half clutch
meaning half good and half bad
what was good if i caught a good vic if i didnt i was bad
took it out on my regulars
i come through and if niggaz was broke i took watches and sneakers
went to jail a few times but that didnt stop me
all it taught me was how not to be sloppy
an older cat robbed me when i was like 10
if anybody wanted to help they shouldve did it then
but they didnt and all it did was release the beast
so im a feast on whatever i come across in the streets

like the wind like the wind
god will take god will take
all my sins all of my sins
blown away will be blown away
like the wind like the wind
like the wind like the wind
blooown

i had a s on my chest fuck the vest
did robberies with some cats and robbed the rest
other time i came thought with just me and my dog
and clear out the whole fuck block cause we when hard
i bag some niggaz i knew and some niggaz i didnt
i aint a fuck either way it was no bullshiting
im a cruddy niggaz out to get money
and a couple of slugs is the only thing anybody took from me
run up on a cat smooth like put it in his left ear
give up the money the jewelry or get left here
keep thinking its a game and play lets get popped
see how much fun you having when your heart be stopped
shut em down open up shop oh-oh no-oh blow off a nigga top
somebody call the cops but its to late
cause im a hit you in the face
and what will kill you will be something that you ate

like the wind like the wind
god will take god will take
all my sins all of my sins
blown away will be blown away
like the wind like the wind
like the wind like the wind
blooown

if pain is love why hide my pain with drugs
choke off haze and sell attics coke for days
same clothes and no soup to shave
and i still got a gun on my hip for your open grave
we used to get robbery vics
until my man got killed for his whip on some robbery shit
then i switched to the weed and start selling crack
but i will pull a steel and put a shell up in ya back
i feel like all my life i was held up in a trap
like if i go to heaven maybe hell will want me back
but all i really want is sperwells up an a lap
and a model bitch sitting with a head in my lap
but since no doe dont spin
and my pant hole got hole within i got to fold ya men
its obvious i live in a house of sin
i wish i could open up the door and let em blow at the wind

like the wind
god will take
all my sins
blown away
like the wind
like the wind

if i dont know where im coming from
where would i go
if i dont know where im coming from
where would i go
if i dont know where im coming from
where would i go

places that ive have been things that i have seen
what you call a nightmare are what i have as dreams
bad as that may seem i know is only going to get worse
love a slug which one am i gonna get first
my journeys been a rough one im not sure when it begins
but the way its looking i kind of know when its gonna end
hold me down baby its gonna be a rough ride
niggas give us plenty of room cause i guess enough died
let me travel cause my intentions are to travel in peace
fuck around i lay you down you hit the gravel and cease
i could be a beast or i could be a gentleman
but if you aint my dog you gonna be like oh its him again
niggas will never win this whole rap game is mine
hot as you ever been i was that in eighty nine
seek and you shall find look within and you will know
where you coming from and where you gotta go
come on

if i dont know where im coming from
where would i go
if i dont know where im coming from
where would i go
-got to keep it real with me
if i dont know where im coming from
where would i go
-so the hell with you
if i dont know where im coming from
where would i go
-i think im going to the top
me and dmx

i will spend mad time in one spot plotting my next move
trying to figure out what is it that x do what x do
some questions go unanswered thats what im afraid of
sometimes i cant show but i know what im made of
they made love or should i say they made lust
bound there didnt have to be love there but they made us
i got quite a few sisters i was the only boy
but being with my dog was my only joy
like a kid with a new toy i forgot about theÂ 
escaped the misery didnt think about the crime
lost all track of time was in another world
everybody knew earl but there was another earl
like the side of the dark riding the park but wouldnt want to
when they jump me became a good runner
one by one they all went under so i had the last laugh
they all thought it all was a joke but i had the last laugh

ha ha ha ha ha ha
come on

if i dont know where im coming from
where would i go
-if i dont know i dont know
if i dont know where im coming from
where would i go
-but i know where im going
if i dont know where im coming from
where would i go
-but i know where im going
if i dont know where im coming from
where would i go
-do you know do you know

i feel the ghost from within coming back to haunt me
stay love in my peoples even though they dont want me
when i was bad i was forgotten like i was dead and rotten
shouldve been getting love but instead was plotting
shit wasnt right and it was all blamed on me
didnt know that i was special till this rap shit came to be
gave me a way out showed me it was better to teach
than bust niggas with the fo-fo leave them dead in the streets
over beef that was worth less than the cost of the slugs
that i bought to kill them
and thats because i thought i ought to kill them
little did i know death wasnt right
didnt always show every breath was a life
it was to be captured in suspended animation
to be felt by all understood by every nation
whats the sense of hating when i can show love
whats the sense of faking when i can show blood

now whats the moral to this story

come on

if i dont know where im coming from
where would i go
if i dont know where im coming from
where would i go
-if i dont know i dont know
if i dont know where im coming from
where would i go
-but i know where im coming from
if i dont know where im coming from
where would i go
-do you know where youre coming from

but to me its blatant 
nothin but all the blood here 
im dealin with satan 
plus with all the hatin 
its hard to keep peace uh huh 
thou shall not steal 
but i will to eat 
i tried doin good but 
goods not too good for me 
misunderstood 
why you chose the hood for me 
me im aiight 
i just had to work hard at it 
went to grama for answers 
she told me that god had it 
so now here i am 
confused and full of questions 
am i born to lose 
or is this just a lesson 
and who its goin choose 
when it gets turned around 
and will it be 
layin in my own blood 
and on the ground 

my child 
ive watched you grow up 
and ive been there uh huh 
even at those times 
you least suspected it 
i was there 
and look at what ive given you 
a talent to rhyme 
i may not come when you call 
but im always on time 

somebodys knockin 
should i let em in 
lord were just startin 
but where will it end 
somebodys knockin 
should i let em in 
lord were just startin 
but where will it end 
but when the funds are low 
the gunsll blow 
lookin for that one that owe 
make em run that dough 

no 
put down the guns 
and write a new rhyme 
youll get it all in due time 
youll do fine 
just have faith 
cuz you mine uh huh 
and when you shine 
its goin be a sight to behold 
so dont fight to be old 
or lose sight when its cold 
see that light down the road 
its goin guide you there 
two sets of footprints 
i was right beside you there 

but what about them times i 
only saw one 
those were the times that i was 
under the gun 

it was then i carried you my son 
led you to safety 
it just wasnt your time to face me uh huh 

ayo a few of them times i thought you would erase me 
but all you did was embrace me 
prepared me for the worst 
offered me eternal light 
and scared me with the hearse 
and the curse 
turned to grace 
when the hurt 
turned to faith 
no more runnin uh huh 
and slidin in the dirt 
cuz im safe 

somebodys knockin 
should i let em in 
lord were just startin 
but where will it end 
somebodys knockin 
should i let em in 

so if im yo man 
im in yo hand 
wus yo plan 
never had a friend 
cuz you couldnt trust your man 
learned to stand before i crawled 
things were twisted 
and if you showed me anything at all 
then i missed it 
looked the wrong way uh huh 
ive done some wrong things true 
kept a bad attitude 
but thats what wrong brings 
and now you mean to tell me that 
after all this time 
it was you that kept the dog from goin out of his mind 
it was you that breathed life 
into my lungs when i was born 
and it was you that let me know 
what was right 
from what was wrong 
and it was you that let me do 
what i knew what could be done 
and it was you that gave me a good wife 
and a beautiful son 
and its been you speakin to me 
inside my mind 
and its been you who has forgiven 
time after time 
it was you who opened my eyes 
so i could see 
and it was you who shined yo

hear me from the life that calls
and all the things i need to find an answer for
but in the end i know iâll see
the truth in all that i believe
i do what i gotta do
cause i know that this is where i wanna be

got a lot to say but donât know who to talk to
step with a purpose but donât know where to walk to
anything i ever said ever meant something
i know because the person i said it to told me it meant something
my life has a meaningmy life has a purpose
no matter how dark it gets i knew that it was worth it
fuck what it looked like on the surface
seen it all but not all heard us like sometimes i was worthless

i hate when i sense this shit trying to make sense of this shit knowing that its sensitive shit
niggas so dumb that they donât even sense the shit
you said the shit so i know you meant the shit you said

in the darkest days the rain that falls
hear me from the life that calls
and all the things i need to find an answer for
but in the end i know iâll see
the truth in all that i believe
i do what i gotta do
cause i know that this is where i wanna be

born with addiction with fast living with high stakes
i race down a highway of life with no breaks
make no apologies for the risks that i take
and manning up to the repercussions that i face
no silver spoon i was raised in a crowded room
rarely seen the sun faced a lot of gloom
i hit the streets too soon before 21
working on the clock since and on it until iâm done
iâm never clocking out but always locking in
i had a warm heart lost a lot of friends
and losing them make me feel like i was drowning
so please forgive the chill i know you feel when you around me
dreamed of living right big family the picket fence
grandkids i will get to share my story with
but here i am living vile as i stand my ground
just hope it doesnât end with shots fired man down

in the darkest days the rain that falls
hear me from the life that calls
and all the things i need to find an answer for
but in the end i know iâll see
the truth in all that i believe
i do what i gotta do
cause i know that this is where i wanna be

and when i came back you accepted me with open arms and said all is forgiven
and i became so strong that i could fight off the devil with just spoken words say it devil i rebuke you and i saw that i was heard
because no matter what ive been through i can deal with it
and because of what i went through i was still fitted - with the armor that comes with the blood of jesus

or when youre lost he will lead the flock to find the one just like any father trying to find his son
and let me remind you no matter where you at he will find you and help you put the negative behind you
