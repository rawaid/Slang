how could something so simple as general conversation
mean much more than general conversation
hey you could tell life had beaten him down

then in any natural disaster disease or gang wars
before guns they was swords and they was killin each other
and whats changed to this day still killin each other
killin a brother while another mother cries for help
man we need to help a brother find himself
feed em light 1 2 3
hey thats somethin every brother should see
and thats fo real
and thats fo real

i was at the gas station when a man walked past
with a signwill work for food clothes or cash
and he asked if he could pump my gas so i let him
clean the windsheild and throw out the trash so i let him
hey i even asked a brother his name
where he was from got kids man and whats they ages
he kinda stared for a second he kinda looked suprised
that anyone would even take an interest in his life
he said young brother them the only words ive heard in the last year
wasnt no or get the fuck away from herrrr
how could something so simple as general conversation
mean much more than general conversation
hey you could tell life had beaten him down
like he was in the title fight and this might be his last round
sometimes the easiest things we take for granted
until they gone then realized we even had it
fo real fo real fo real

ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
yeah hey
ohhhhh
n dey say
ohhhhhh oh ohhhh
ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
yeah hey
ohhhhh
n dey say
ohhhhhh oh ohhhh

i used to think that life had a plan for me
until i realized life had to be planned by me
see thats the key i only deal wit what i can see
cuz over history mystery brought us nothin but misery
man more people done died in the name of the lord
then in any natural disaster disease or gang wars
before guns they was swords and they was killin each other
and whats changed to this day still killin each other
killin a brother while another mother cries for help
man we need to help a brother find himself
feed em light 1 2 3
hey thats somethin every brother should see
and thats fo real
and thats fo real
and thats fo real

before guns they was swords and they was killin each other
and whats changed to this day still killin each other
killin a brother while another mother cries for help

oure a warrior fighting for your soul
taken from the world above and brought down the world below

youre the son of his majesty
remember how it used to be
in the light of day its easy to see
now its nighttime
you had to leave

separated from the king
now the waters rushing and you keep trying to swim against the stream
and it seems like your not moving the many waters gushing you gasp for air
almost drowning ears ringing once upon a time we were singing
one day the trees will stand and clap hands
stream of thought getting caught in the klipa this place is just a shell external
egos swell that onell burn ya we fell a long way down that eternal frownll get you
you look vexed its the dregs the yetzer haras lurking
trying to make you forget we got a job to do
youre a priest and a prince and you cant be moved

[chorus]
youre a warrior fighting for your soul
taken from a world above and brought down to a world below
re-united re-united return the princess to the king
re-united re-united shes been taken for so long
re-united re-united and then shell be filled with joy
re-united re-united like the days of her youth

descended to the pit
whats this feeling cant get rid of it
soul sick
cant seem to shake it
when one retires at night weeping joy will come in the morning
you made my mountain stand strong

[chorus]

like and ancient memory
remember how it used to be
close your eyes and breath in
thats the scent of freedom
ringing across the sea
land of milk and honey
one day will wake up from this dream and well stop sleeping
oh yo then well see clearly

[chorus][nelly]

on rodeo drive walkin in her roberto cavalli
i should probably walk up to the register and say i got it
go and pick up what you like its nothin ma dont worry about it
that bag should be carried by somebody so exotic
and that dress should be worn when theres nothin else up under
just in case i run into you i can pull up to your bumper
she politely declined when i offered her my number
then i asked her whats her name said shed rather make me wonder
so i paid and she laughed carried out her bags outside
and i couldnt get her ass i tried
as i watch her leave out the store
how one man wanted shorty ass and more for sure

[chorus]

its like hate taking over the whole world what is it over
suicide man thats the devil trying to control us they told us
but we didnt notice the pain was sitting on they shoulders
the world was just a polar the rather live in the solar
system got us hopeless and focused on forclosures
wake up and smell the folgers oh momma and bring home the soldiers
osama you owe us the 9 11 was bogus now we right back at him
say the war is our motive

wake up early in the streets of the block streets of the block
he posted up on the corner like a soldier in the drill but he wouldnt stop
living life in the battlefield battlefield trying to survive every day and every night
its the same deal
lifes strange lifes strange times change times change but karma always finds the way
stay strong stay strong hold on hold on
dont let all your dreams fade away

yeah life can beat you down what goes it comes around
its not how you hit the ground its how fast you get back up
and go keep goingtill it feels like im giving my life away
gets hardand harder happiness is worth the wait
cause on my own is a better way
cause on my own is a better way

a lot of mothers they just dont understand they just dont understand
they think were hard on our sons but we gotta teach our boys how to be a man
they only know when they walk out the door when they walk out the door
see we can show em how to fire but they gotta teach themselves how to reload
cause unenployment is harder than its ever been sometimes it feels like i cant win

and even through all the rules keep changing im stronger now than i was when i came in

yeah life can beat you down what goes it comes around
its not how you hit the ground its how fast you get back up
and go keep going to feel like im giving my life away
gets hard and harder happiness is worth the wait
cause on my own is a better way
cause on my own is a better way

hey hey going through the back streets like i got beef
carnival for carnivores with the sharp teeth
animalistic its why we call the cops beast
were on the hunt cause theyre hungry for the dark meat
im rapping through my heart beat brain is the base my heart is the drum
give the drum some promis of a better life is all i got to give
i aint just trying to survive im trying to live

cause all i want is a better way
hey if youre not prepared the world can be so cold
all that you can do is your best and just hope
in time the truth will show just stick to what you know
get a grip on something real and never let it go

and go keep going to feel like im giving my life away
gets harder and harder happiness is worth the wait
cause on my own is a better way
cause on my own is a better wayits like no matter what i try to do i just cant make her happy
see every other day is like she throwing new shit at me
a constant petty complain about every single thing 
hard to swagga maintain shorty driving me insane
and in the beginning ill admit it if you said it i was on it
and even if i thought you did me wrong girl i was coping
i guess a nigger was hoping thinkin bout eloping
see i just call it focus but some might call it open
its like im compromising everything i stood for
im breaking rules that every nigger in the hood know
one weigh it yourself two never play yourself three it dont matter girl
i throw em out the window cause for you

i bend over backwards id do anything you say
im here for you baby dont have to worry about me

a litile bit goes a long way
if i give you one would you want two if i give you two
would you want three 
they say a litile bit goes a long way
if i give you one would you want two if i give you two
would you want three

somebody say relationships should be like 50-50
how come i feel im giving mine but not receiving any
why must you make it so hard to play the part
i put you in the light but yet you leave me in the dark
and every time i think of you before you go back
and every time i think our train is straight you jump track
what the fuck was that
you always doing that let me turn the shit on you
and let mesee how you react
